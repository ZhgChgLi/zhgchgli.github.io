a new manager, everything felt confusing; my knowledge of management was limited to compiling previous work experiences, observations, or casual chats with colleagues. I knew which actions by supervisors were positive and which were negative from the perspective of their subordinates. That was about all I had—fragmented knowledge without a systematic concept. So, I started reading books and began recording each author’s experiences. When encountering similar situations, having this “knowledge confidence” helped me avoid panic.</p><h3 id="leading-snowflakes"><span class="me-2">Leading Snowflakes</span><a href="#leading-snowflakes" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><ul><li><p>Please provide the Markdown paragraphs you want me to translate into English.</p><li><p>Author: Oren Ellenbogen</p><li><p>Publication Year: 2013</p><li><p><a href="https://leadingsnowflakes.com/" target="_blank">Official Website</a></p><li><p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/tzangms" target="_blank">海總理</a> for the recommendation</p></ul><p>The author has spent nearly 20 years progressing from a software engineer to management roles. He has served as a Technical Lead and Engineering Manager in both large corporations and startups. This book clearly outlines the challenges engineers face when moving into management and the methods to organize and solve them.</p><p>I find it very similar to my background, both originally in software development and just starting in management; the key points mentioned in the book taught me many practical methods!</p><blockquote><p><em>- This article is a personal note combined with some personal opinions.

We have already proven this. Instead, the standard is leading, driving, and improving the team’s capabilities and goals.</p><p>However, you cannot completely detach yourself from the task, as fully disconnecting from the task details may lead to losing connection with team members, which poses significant long-term risks to execution results, priorities, and trust.</p><p>So being a manager doesn’t mean you don’t do engineering tasks; rather, you need to engage in both. It’s about finding the right balance between being an engineer (Maker) and a manager (Manager).</p><p>As engineers, we like to have uninterrupted time to stay in context and solve difficult problems; but as managers, we need to frequently step out to help the team and care for teammates, so being interrupted is actually part of a manager’s job.</p><h4 id="but-we-also-need-to-be-both-engineers-and-managers-what-should-we-do"><span class="me-2">But we also need to be both engineers and managers. What should we do?</span><a href="#but-we-also-need-to-be-both-engineers-and-managers-what-should-we-do" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>The author suggests creating two Calendars: one as Maker (engineer) and one as Manager. Every morning, spend 15–30 minutes organizing your thoughts, planning the day’s schedule, deciding what tasks to do, what meetings you have, and identifying continuous free time slots to tackle tasks (as Maker).</p><p><a href="/assets/1c9eafd4a190/1*7772qy7BVUCPa4LbvLGv6g.webp" class="popup img-link blur"><img data-src="/assets/1c9eafd4a190/1*7772qy7BVUCPa4LbvLGv6g.webp" alt="Author's Calendar Template" data-lqip="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIxMjAwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjY0NSI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iZ3JleSIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="></a></p><p>Author’s Calendar Template</p><h4 id="we-also-need-focused-time"><span class="me-2">We also need focused time</span><a href="#we-also-need-focused-time" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>The author states that although we are now managers, we still need to handle tasks; the available focus time during gaps is more important to us than before.</p><p>The author mentions that you can use certain actions to signal your teammates during focused times, indicating “Please do not disturb me for now!”</p><p>Methods include: going to the conference room, wearing headphones, or even buying an ON AIR! switch light to place on the desk.</p><p>If it’s not an urgent issue, you can ask your teammates to leave comments or compile information in an email for you to handle after your focused work time.</p><h4 id="assessing-tasks-you-can-complete-as-an-engineer-within-your-available-time"><span class="me-2">Assessing Tasks You Can Complete as an Engineer Within Your Available Time</span><a href="#assessing-tasks-you-can-complete-as-an-engineer-within-your-available-time" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>Since I can no longer focus solely on development tasks like when I was purely an engineer (Maker), I need to choose tasks that I can personally execute based on the available time in the engineer’s schedule.</p><p>Do not become the technical bottleneck of the team. Our mission is to enhance team capabilities, explore new technologies, and broaden the company’s internal and external technical perspectives. Possible tasks include researching technical issues in advance, sharing findings with teammates and letting them execute, resolving company technical debt, improving processes to boost development efficiency, adopting new technologies, open-sourcing company technology, providing open APIs, hosting external hackathons, and more.</p><h4 id="the-most-important-thing-is-balance"><span class="me-2">The Most Important Thing Is Balance</span><a href="#the-most-important-thing-is-balance" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>The author suggests starting with a 15–20% ratio. Originally, it was 100% as Maker, but now it could be 20% as Maker / 80% as Manager (depending on the actual team size and member capabilities; the author also mentions 50% / 50% is possible). The key point is not to spend 100% of the time on engineering development but to invest more effort in management.</p><h4 id="make-good-use-of-11"><span class="me-2">Make Good Use of 1:1</span><a href="#make-good-use-of-11" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>Regularly hold 1:1 meetings with teammates to give mutual feedback and share what you have learned.</p><h4 id="if-managerial-tasks-consume-all-your-time"><span class="me-2">If managerial tasks consume all your time</span><a href="#if-managerial-tasks-consume-all-your-time" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>The author finally mentions that if you manage too many tasks and cannot do engineering work (as a Maker), or if you feel disconnected from tasks and technology, consider working from home a few days a week to isolate from the company or participate in hackathons.</p><h3 id="lesson-2--code-review-your-management-decisions"><span class="me-2">Lesson 2. — Code Review” Your Management Decisions</span><a href="#lesson-2--code-review-your-management-decisions" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Regularly review the decisions you make as a manager.</p><p>As engineers, we have many methods or tools to improve our skills by following them, such as pair programming, code review, and design patterns; but as managers, especially beginners, we often feel quite lonely.</p><p>We don’t want to admit our ignorance about superiors or subordinates, fear taking responsibility for the team’s success, or worry about balancing technical (debt) and business needs.</p><p>The author mentions stepping out to seek ways to improve management skills, openly requesting feedback, and enhancing management abilities; being as passionate about managing as when working as an engineer.</p><h4 id="record--review-decisions"><span class="me-2">Record &amp; Review Decisions</span><a href="#record--review-decisions" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>Colleagues and bosses are powerful resources we often underestimate. We can quickly learn from their feedback; establishing good records and reviewing decisions regularly helps us receive better feedback.</p><p>The author mentioned:</p><blockquote><p>“There is no one right way, there are only tradeoffs.”</p></blockquote><p>I think so too. If it weren’t a dilemma, you probably wouldn’t ask me; asking means your teammates don’t know how to decide.</p><p>We can list the options and provide decisions to teammates, but at the same time, we must record the decisions made.</p><p><a href="/assets/1c9eafd4a190/1*ckCF-uBpxAjNzbUTdvMhBA.webp" class="popup img-link blur"><img data-src="/assets/1c9eafd4a190/1*ckCF-uBpxAjNzbUTdvMhBA.webp" alt="Sample Record Sheet Provided by the Author" data-lqip="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIxMjAwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjM5OCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iZ3JleSIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="></a></p><p>Template of the Record Sheet Provided by the Author</p><p>Develop the habit of keeping records, and make sure the content can be recalled later.</p><p>The author suggests reviewing monthly and sharing the discussion and decisions with your boss, other managers, or colleagues (at least half of the issues). Listen to others’ opinions; anonymity can protect the individuals involved, focus on the issue, not the person, and keep a record.</p><h4 id="key-points-for-retrospective-review"><span class="me-2">Key Points for Retrospective Review</span><a href="#key-points-for-retrospective-review" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p><strong>About the Issue:</strong></p><ul><li><p>How many technical issues does it cause?</p><li><p>Is it a personal issue?</p><li><p>Is it just an individual member’s isolated issue?

He feared damaging their original relationship, so he took on all the finishing tasks by himself. However, he eventually realized that the more he tried to protect the relationship, the more distant he became from his teammates. His constant solitary hard work and lack of sharing caused his teammates to lose confidence.</p><p>Looking back, the author says that instead of fearing hurting teammates’ feelings, it’s better to speak your true thoughts. The fear of “hurting teammates” is simply a selfish imagination and unnecessary.

Our mission is to lead the team’s growth, so we should not delay whenever there is an opportunity to give feedback. Not making a decision is also a decision. Moreover, once the culture of feedback weakens, it becomes even harder to reignite.</p></ol><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>Can take time to write down ways to motivate teammates and ask the supervisor if they are being too protective of the teammates?</p><h3 id="lesson-4--teach-how-to-get-things-done"><span class="me-2">Lesson 4. — Teach how to get things done</span><a href="#lesson-4--teach-how-to-get-things-done" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>How to complete tasks with lower risk.</p><p>Leading by example is a good approach.
