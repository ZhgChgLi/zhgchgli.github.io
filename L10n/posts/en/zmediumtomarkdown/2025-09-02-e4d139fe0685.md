- **Seamless LINE Transfer Integration:** No need to use iPASS MONEY for transfers between friends

#### [Line Bank US Remittance Promotion — Outgoing Fee NT$150, Incoming Fee NT$50](https://www.linebank.com.tw/wealth-investment/promotions/10){:target="_blank"}

**[2026/01/01 Extended Again]:**

> *Promotion Period: The original promotion period is from 2026/1/1 to 2026/6/30*

> *Promotion: Foreign currency outbound transfer fee is NT$150 per transaction (originally NT$600), and foreign currency inbound transfer fee is NT$50 per transaction (originally NT$400)*

> *Promotion products: foreign currency outbound remittance, foreign currency inbound remittance*

This is the biggest incentive for using LINE Bank. Until 2026/06/30, depositing to Firstrade with a LINE Bank account only incurs a 150 TWD handling fee, with no telegraphic transfer or other fees.

> *Memo: This promotion started from 2025/01–06 and has been extended twice due to positive feedback (extended from 2025/06 to 2025/12, and again from 2025/12 to 2026/06). **Please note the dates!***

[Click here to apply](https://www.linebank.com.tw/R/mgm-portal?campaignId=2&uid=bfQqph){:target="_blank"}

#### Disadvantages

This time, to set up a designated account, since LINE Bank has no physical branches, you must verify with a National ID Certificate; therefore, you need to visit the household registration office to apply for the certificate before use, which is more troublesome than going directly to a bank.

### Advantages of Firstrade

- Easy account opening, simple interface and features, beginner-friendly for US stock trading

- Supports Chinese interface

- Trade with 0 commission fees

- Established Broker

> *Please be sure to use the name on your passport for account registration.*

### Reference Timeline for Deposit (Fastest 2 Days to Account Credit)

![Here is the timeline from my deposit to Firstrade on 10/14 until receiving the remittance subsidy.](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*mhmGifQYaJacIOXwPqIC_A.png)

Here is the timeline from my deposit to Firstrade on 10/14 until receiving the remittance subsidy.

- Please note that the above assumes the designated account has already been linked or the amount is less than 50,000. The first time linking a designated account takes +2 days to take effect.

- LINE Bank shows that the receiving bank has received the funds. There is a time lag before Firstrade actually receives the money. (It probably waits until Firstrade finishes processing during business hours before showing as received)

- There may be a delay in applying for the remittance subsidy (for single transfers over $10,000) after Firstrade receives the funds. If you don't see the record, please check again later or the next day.

- If the transaction details cannot be confirmed within 60 seconds, the exchange rate quote may be updated.

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*jaADV3k1wdNZuz2zpogLQA.jpeg)

### LINE Bank Remittance Deposit Firstrade Progress Inquiry

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*nEUD0C8nOO1E2uS9p6u8rw.png)

You can find the foreign currency remittance notification in the top right notification area of the LINE Bank App. Click it to check the remittance progress.

- On non-holidays, the transfer is usually completed the same day; on holidays, it will be processed on the next business day after two days.

- **If the beneficiary information is incorrect, the payment will be rejected, and you will need to pay a return transfer fee to resend the payment.**

#### Remittance Application Form (Transaction Record / Receipt)

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*EH8g25Pxoewchc5gt7qK_w.jpeg)

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*DMrWpw9JdcFVOYuEWgNmkw.png)

Line Bank App progress inquiry notification (as mentioned above), scroll down to find the "Request Deposit Slip/Transaction Receipt" button. Click it to have the remittance slip sent to your email. You can open the file using your ID number.

#### The receiving bank has received the funds, but Firstrade hasn't seen the deposit?

This is normal. Although the remittance status on Line Bank shows "Beneficiary bank has received the funds" and the transfer is complete, Firstrade still needs to wait for a U.S. business day (time) to confirm the funds.

As shown in the image above, although the funds were received at 8/27 AM 09:00, Firstrade only confirmed the funds at 8/28 AM 02:10 and sent the deposit notification email:

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*7g0qrnxcoE5aYYz0erJrpw.png)

At this point, log in to Firstrade to see the funds credited, and you can start trading US stocks:

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*83_EXDsxQpwqgfmkHogYbw.png)

"My Account" → "Account Records" will also have deposit records available for inquiry.

### Line Bank Account Upgrade and Binding Designated Account Tutorial

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*ZbYDlcVZlCEE4fdKgeaWWQ.png)

**Benefits Comparison:**

- (Benefit upon account opening) Basic account: maximum NT$10,000 per transaction, NT$30,000 per day, NT$50,000 per month.

- (After customer service video call) Account upgrade: single transaction limit up to 50,000, daily limit up to 100,000, monthly limit up to 200,000.

- (After natural person certificate + customer service video verification) Designated account: single transaction limit up to 500,000.

#### Line Bank Account Upgrade

It's actually just upgrading to the basic limit of other banks. **(This step does not require a National ID certificate.)**

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*aFqGx67be74ZZr75wUvT-w.png)

Open the LINE Bank App, scroll down under "More" to find "Others" → "Account Upgrade," select the type of account to upgrade → choose **2. Video Verification "Start Verification >".**

- Please ensure your internet connection is stable and working properly.

- Ensure video call is available currently

Clicking will initiate a video call with customer service. You will need to have a video conversation with the representative, who may verify your account information (e.g., ask about your current balance). Once confirmed, your account upgrade will be completed.

### Designate Firstrade Remittance Account

It is more recommended to directly set the Firstrade remittance account as the designated account for convenience, speed, and security.

- The designated account will take effect after 2 days.

- The designated account requires prior verification with a National Identification Certificate.

- **The Citizen Digital Certificate verification only supports cards starting with TP07, which have an NFC chip inside**

#### Applying for a Citizen Digital Certificate

Please first complete the online [Natural Person Application Form](https://moica.nat.gov.tw/rac_form.html){:target="_blank"}:

![[Natural Person Application Form](https://moica.nat.gov.tw/rac_form.html){:target="_blank"}](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*4xi8pHeUNAPZKijWiXfj1Q.png)

[Natural Person Application Form](https://moica.nat.gov.tw/rac_form.html){:target="_blank"}

After submission, you can go to any household registration office counter (not limited to your registered residence) within 7 days to complete the process.

- **Processing Fee: $250**

- On-site processing and on-site distribution

- Few people apply for the Natural Person Certificate at the household registration office, which is usually open at noon.

#### Line Bank Adds Designated Firstrade Overseas Remittance Account

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*Mi9tRTDMpubsVfWF6AXidg.png)

Open the LINE Bank App → "More" → Scroll down to Foreign Exchange, tap "My Remittance Records" → "Agreed Remittance Account" → "Add Agreed Account".

#### First Time Use — Complete Account Verification

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*nLPxsTJ1ALuv4hLZPcdqmw.jpeg)

The first binding requires completing both the "National ID Certificate Verification" and "Video Verification." The video verification, along with account upgrade, must be done via video call with customer service to verify account information.

**For the Citizen Digital Certificate, you need to use the newly issued certificate card and complete the verification by tapping the card:**

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*-N0scmyLMlqgPHbuDpmD-Q.png)

> *The NFC range of the citizen digital certificate is quite small. I retried several times before succeeding; on iPhone, hold the camera near the center of the card, move the card left and right, and after a few attempts, verification will succeed.*

#### Add Designated Account

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*RvHTvjTzjap4M09RG5Q8xQ.png)

Enter the account information and remittance details as introduced earlier in order. After confirming they are correct, click "Next."

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*2VbwWyl9zQCY9p2fVVoL2w.png)

You need to complete two-factor SMS verification by switching to the newly received message and entering the four-digit code; wait about 1–2 minutes, and receiving a confirmation SMS means the verification is complete.

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*WmXzGCmOWMkOxwMhYJ-mfQ.png)

After successful verification, the designated account will be added successfully!

- After adding, an exclamation mark will appear at the top right corner, indicating it is not yet effective.

- **Takes effect after 2 days.**

#### Line Bank Firstrade Designated Account Transfer

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*TfcH3RFr1wR7XKjKjqnvJQ.png)

"My Transfer Records" → "Agreed Transfer Account" → Select Account → Enter Amount → Choose "Transfer via Agreed Account" → All information will be filled automatically.

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*L-g13ZQ2uS2PqHRyomDD4g.png)

You can check the fee subsidy record under "My Account" → "Account Records".

> *Firstrade may have a short delay of about one day: the application status disappears, and the account record does not show the subsidy; the deposit record appears after about one more day!*

> ***Although LINE Bank only charges TWD $150, the actual remittance fee exceeds USD $25, so we still subsidize USD $25.***
