- [**[English Version]** : [Quick Start! ] Github Action x ZReviewTender Free and Fast Deployment of Your App Store Review Monitoring Bot](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender/blob/main/quickstart.md){:target="_blank"}

### [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"}

[![](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/516425682/1cc1a829-d87d-4d4a-925b-60471b912b23)](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"}

ZReviewTender — is an open-source App store review bot I created in August 2022. It automatically fetches user reviews from the iOS App Store and Android Google Play stores and forwards them to a designated Slack channel.

You can also specify review fetching rules, integrate with Google Translate, Asana, Google Sheets, and support custom operations.

### [Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions){:target="_blank"}

Github Action is a CI/CD automation tool provided by Github. We can use our own machines as servers (Github Runner) or directly use machines provided by Github to run CI/CD and automation scripts.

#### Costs and Limitations

- [Use Your Own Machine (Github Runner)](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#usage-limits){:target="_blank"}

- [Using GitHub-provided runners:](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#included-storage-and-minutes){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*QyhxZ98B20NV18-W5vKJDg.png)

GitHub Free provides basic 500 MB Storage (for CI/CD Artifacts) and 2,000 minutes of execution time per month.

[**Note here is due to machine cost issues:**](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#minute-multipliers){:target="_blank"}

- If using Github's Windows machines, the consumed minutes equal the actual minutes multiplied by 2.

- If you use Github's macOS machines, the consumed minutes equal the actual minutes multiplied by 10.

For detailed pricing calculations, please refer to the [official pricing calculator](https://github.com/pricing/calculator?feature=actions){:target="_blank"}.

> [***ZReviewTender***](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="*blank"} **_Approximate monthly usage: 120 minutes_**

> *Only needs to run on basic priced Linux, each execution takes ≤ 1 minute, default runs every 6 hours, spending 4 minutes per day, about 120 minutes per month, well within the free tier.*

> [***ZReviewTender***](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="*blank"} **_Storage usage: 0***

> *No use of Artifact to store data, so there is no Storage cost.*

### [Slack](https://slack.com/){:target="_blank"}

The company's internal communication software will create a Slack App and use this Slack App identity to forward App Store review notifications to a specified channel.

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*HMMyU5jwY9iAMyiKmNgVJQ.png)

### [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} x [Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions){:target="_blank"} x [Slack](https://slack.com/){:target="_blank"}

> *We use Github Action to run the ZReviewTender script and forward results to Slack. The Github Repo (Action) is only used as a carrier, so even if your main project is not hosted on Github, you can still easily deploy ZReviewTender by following the steps below. 🎉🎉🎉*

> ***I have successfully deployed it on different Apps from 5 different companies, running stably and free of charge for over 2 years.***

#### Advantages:

- **Free**: [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} is a free and open-source service I created, deployed on [Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions){:target="_blank"} using the free tier, which is more than sufficient.  
  You don’t need to pay monthly fees for App Review Bot or similar review monitoring services.

- **Security**: The credentials and keys used to fetch reviews are securely stored in your Github Private Repo, and only you have access.  
  You no longer need to risk leaking important credentials or keys by uploading them to third-party services; [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} is open-source, and all operations are open to public review.

- **Reliable**: [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} uses the latest official APIs to fetch review data. Compared to other services using RSS feeds, it is more accurate, stable, and reliable.

> [***If this project has helped you, please consider buying me a coffee. Thank you.***](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/zhgchgli){:target="_blank"}

### Quick Start!🚀

> ***The entire setup takes about 30 minutes but only needs to be done once. Unless the credential keys are changed, it can run permanently for free and stably.*** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

#### Step 1. Create a Slack App

If your organization already has a Slack App with message-sending permissions like `chat:write`, you can reuse it directly without creating a new one.

[**Go to Slack Apps homepage:**](https://api.slack.com/apps){:target="_blank"}

![<https://api.slack.com/apps>{:target="_blank"}](/assets/0095528cf875/1*JDaxmORRL3ipdeA0ZaHW3w.png)

<https://api.slack.com/apps>{:target="_blank"}

Click the "Create New App" button at the top right corner.

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*sFxmX9qty4UEgMhiTglEfA.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*XiqfLoEmITHyF9E-rDPjPQ.png)

1. Choose: From scratch

2. Enter App Name: `ZReviewTender` or a custom Slack App name

3. Select the target Slack Workspace for installation: Please make sure you have permission to add a Slack App to the Workspace you choose.

4. Create App

**Add OAuth & Permissions Scopes:**  
After creating the Slack app, go to the "OAuth & Permissions" tab to set the Scopes.

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*VjXVtAkVN8PLtCAOHocAmA.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*WSNd89bJuG1xCIPM9SsLnA.png)

1. Select "OAuth & Permissions"

2. Scroll down to find the Scopes Section

3. Enter the three required scopes for adding the ZReviewTender Slack App in order:

```vbnet
chat:write
chat:write.public
links:write
```

**Install App**  
Go back to the Install App tab to install the Slack App into your Workspace.

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*qItvJK5tZ-i8vE5bNUZIKQ.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*Eevu3Sir68DhfFSrFKb1xg.png)

1. Select "Install App"

2. Click "Install to *YOUR_WORKSPACE*"

3. Click "Allow"

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*lj8KZ5bEOG9urPgtxet-YA.png)

After installation, return to the Install App page where the `Slack App Bot User OAuth Token` will appear. Click "Copy" to copy it, **make sure to save it for later use**.

**Create a Channel to Receive Review Notifications:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*vwILile0Y52PgjQAYLqGjQ.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*jZwuovjXaCbQiWTixOP5Dg.png)

- Sidebar -> Channels -> Create -> Create channel

- Name: Enter the desired channel name

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*cK8ihh9IQPacTjGKG4GS3Q.png)

**Visibility:**

- Public: Open to everyone, no further action required.

- **Private: Private channel,** ⭐️⭐️⭐️ **You need to add the newly created Slack App:**

**How to Add Slack App to a Channel:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*AgCjAYb94XOmlIJ7VV6gaw.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*GVqrJlBg_9MjVyGitA2g-A.png)

1. Click the #channel name above

2. Click "Settings"

3. Click "Add an App"

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*KU5hdi2m46TUwZbjI-xKmg.png)

1. Search for the Slack App name you just created

2. Click "Add"

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*Qx2XPK8lspCrSauWE4IhXA.png)

A prompt message will appear upon successfully joining the channel: `ZReviewTender joined.`

> ***⭐️⭐️⭐️There is a Slack bug here: a newly created Slack App may not be found immediately and might take some time to appear; you can use a Public Channel first, as Public Channels can be used without adding the Slack App.***

**Get Channel ID:**  
The final and most important step is to obtain the Channel ID for later configuration.

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*CmQtV9QibdOb8zHuiYJS2Q.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*VNmLOs0mBhF6qisDzx6Zcw.png)

1. Click the #channel name above

2. At the bottom, there is Channel ID information.

3. **Note down the `Channel ID` for later configuration**

> ***Slack steps completed.***

— — —

**Other Notes:**

**You can edit the Slack App name and icon in "Basic Information" -> "Display Information":**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*5THTrkeWXYa5QaGCNCmzhQ.png)

Remember to click "Save Changes" at the bottom right to save your modifications.

**If OAuth & Permissions Scopes are updated, you need to click "reinstall your app" to apply the changes:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*pUdxf_G1uoHcq22VGjHOzw.png)

#### Step 2. Generate Apple App Store Connect API & Google Play Android Developer API Credentials

#### Apple App Store Connect API Credentials

**iOS is easier; we only need to get the following four pieces of information from App Store Connect:**

**Issuer ID:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/0*eHn-LMnUlS-04d70.png)

- App Store Connect -> Keys -> [App Store Connect API](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/api){:target="_blank"}

- **Note down the `Issuer ID` for later configuration**

**Private Key ID & Private Key：**

Click the "+" Add Button:

![](/assets/0095528cf875/0*MI0-cA0BTkq5XqkT.png)

- Name: `ZReviewTender`

- Access: `App Manager`

![](/assets/0095528cf875/0*V0U2HjKTRfL8dl1j.png)

- `Key ID` **, to be used later for configuration**

- **Click "Download API Key" to save the downloaded `AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8` file for later configuration.**

**App ID : (The target App ID to fetch reviews)**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*zCgRRm0-nDwvcGOv26Aprw.png)

The App ID can be found in [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps){:target="_blank"} -> App Store -> General -> App Information -> `App ID`.

- **Note down the `App ID` for later configuration**

#### Google Play Android Developer API Credentials

Android is more complex. You need to first enable the API in the Google Cloud Project associated with the app, create a Service Account, and add the Service Account to the Google Play Console with app permissions.

[**Go to Google Cloud Project:**](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome){:target="_blank"}

Select the Google Cloud Project associated with your App project or create a new Project.

**Enable "Android Developer API":**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*zvWFDBuPRq9a6bizjqrx4Q.png)

2. Click "Add Key"

3. Click "Create a new key"

4. Select the key type as "JSON"

5. Click "Create"

6. **Save the downloaded `XXXX-XXXX.json` file for later configuration**

**Add the service account to Google Play Console and grant permissions to the target app for fetching reviews:**

[**Enter the Google Play Console backend:**](https://play.google.com/console/){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*Lbowza_thZaSDx5BuRWMsg.png)

### Other Settings

#### Add Filtering Functionality

Only forward reviews that meet the criteria.

```yaml
    - FilterProcessor:
        class: "FilterProcessor"
        enable: true # enable
        keywordsInclude: [] # keywords you want to filter out
        ratingsInclude: [] # ratings you want to filter out
        territoriesInclude: [] # territories you want to filter out (territory for Apple e.g. TWN)
```

- You only need to add the `FilterProcessor` setting in the `processors` section of `/config/apple.yml` or `/config/android.yml`.

#### Adding Automatic Translation Feature

Automatically translate reviews in languages other than yours using Google Cloud Translation API (may incur costs).

- **Please first ensure that the GCP Project of the Service Account created in Step 2 has the "Cloud Translation API" enabled**

- The configurations for `apple.yml` and `android.yml` have some differences.

`apple.yml:`

```bash
    - GoogleTranslateProcessor: # Google Translate Processor, will translate review text to your language, you can remove whole block if you don't need it.
        class: "GoogleTranslateProcessor"
        enable: true # enable
        googleTranslateAPIKeyFilePath: './config/XXXX-XXXX.json' # Google Translate API Service Account Credential .json File Path
        googleTranslateTargetLang: 'zh-TW' # Translate to what Language
        googleTranslateTerritoriesExclude: ["TWN","CHN"] # Review origin Territory that you don't want to translate. (territory for Apple e.g. TWN)
```

- `./config/XXXX-XXXX.json` (Step 2. The `XXXX-XXXX.json` Service Account key file name saved from GCP IAM)

`android.yml:`

```bash
    - GoogleTranslateProcessor: # Google Translate Processor, will translate review text to your language, you can remove whole block if you don't need it.
        class: "GoogleTranslateProcessor"
        enable: true # enable
        googleTranslateAPIKeyFilePath: './config/XXXX-XXXX.json' # Google Translate API Service Account Credential .json File Path
        googleTranslateTargetLang: 'zh-TW' # Translate to which language
        googleTranslateTerritoriesExclude: ["zh-Hant","zh-Hans"] # Review origin Territory (language) that you don't want to translate. (language for android e.g. zh-Hant, en)
```

- `./config/XXXX-XXXX.json` (Step 2. The `XXXX-XXXX.json` Service Account key file name saved from GCP IAM)

**Complete Example:**

```yaml
platform: 'android'
packageName: '' # Android App Package Name
keyFilePath: '' # Google Android Publisher API Service Account Credential .json File Path
playConsoleDeveloperAccountID: '' # Google Console Developer Account ID
playConsoleAppID: '' # Google Console App ID

        territoriesInclude: [] # territories you want to filter out (territory for Apple e.g. TWN)
    - GoogleTranslateProcessor: # Google Translate Processor, will translate review text to your language, you can remove whole block if you don't need it.
        class: "GoogleTranslateProcessor"

        googleTranslateTargetLang: 'zh-TW' # Translate to what language
        googleTranslateTerritoriesExclude: ["zh-Hant","zh-Hans"] # Review origin territory (language) that you don't want to translate. (language for android e.g. zh-Hant, en)
    - SlackProcessor: # Slack Processor, resend App Review to Slack.
        class: "SlackProcessor"
        enable: true # enable
        slackTimeZoneOffset: "+08:00" # Review created date timezone
        slackAttachmentGroupByNumber: "1" # 1~100, how many review messages in 1 slack message.
        slackBotToken: "" # Slack Bot Token, send slack message through Slack Bot.
        slackBotTargetChannel: "" # Slack Bot Token, send slack message through Slack Bot. (recommended, first priority)
        slackInCommingWebHookURL: "" # Slack Incoming WebHook URL, send slack message through Incoming WebHook, not recommended, deprecated.
