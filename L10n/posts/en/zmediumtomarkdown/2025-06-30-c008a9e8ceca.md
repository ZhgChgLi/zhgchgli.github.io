### 2026 Update — Pricing changes for GitHub Actions (including Self-hosted Runner)

> [TLDR — On January 1, 2026, we are lowering the price of hosted runners, and beginning March 1, 2026, we will charge $0.002 per minute for self-hosted runners. Most customers will not see any change to their bill. Actions will remain free for public repositories.](https://resources.github.com/actions/2026-pricing-changes-for-github-actions/){:target="_blank"}

GitHub 2025/12/14 [Latest Announcement](https://resources.github.com/actions/2026-pricing-changes-for-github-actions/){:target="_blank"}:

- January 1, 2026: GitHub-hosted Runner is now cheaper, with price reductions up to 39%.

- March 1, 2026: **Using Self-hosted Runner requires an additional service maintenance fee of $0.002 per minute (regardless of OS), which equals $1 for 500 minutes, and it is still cost-effective at this point.** ️

- Public repositories still retain the same free tier.

**GitHub will also invest more resources to enhance GitHub Actions features:**

- **Scale Set Client:** Simplifies **Autoscaling** for Self-hosted Runners.

- **multi-label: support restart**, improve Runner label experience.

- GitHub Hosted Runner — macOS 3-core (M1): $0.062 USD/minute, 1,000 minutes equals $62 USD

- Self-Hosted Runner — $0.002 USD/minute, 1,000 minutes equals $2 USD

> *Buy the latest model [Mac Mini 10-core(M4)](https://www.apple.com/tw/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini){:target="_blank"} yourself for about $600 USD, place it in the office as a Self-hosted Runner, and it will pay off in about a year; it offers better and faster performance with almost unlimited usage (**maintenance cost is negligible**).*

> *You can also use an old M1 MacBook Pro as a Runner at zero cost.*

> *The above does not include electricity or internet fees.

#### Preface

After two experiences building App CI/CD in different development teams, I finally have time to organize the journey from "why to do it" to "how to do it." While I can't guarantee this is the most standard CI/CD workflow, it is definitely a valuable starting point to help your team begin implementation, improve product stability, and overall development efficiency.

#### Chapter

This series will start by explaining "What CI/CD is and the value it brings," then proceed with a hands-on guide on "How to build a CI/CD environment using GitHub Actions + self-hosted Runner" and "Implement CI and CD in App development as an example." Finally, it will introduce how to "Use Google Apps Script Web App combined with GitHub Actions to create an easy-to-use App packaging platform for cross-team collaboration." I hope this series will be helpful to you.

CI/CD — Entirely developed with GitHub Actions for easy maintenance and scalability.

**CI:**

- Trigger Unit Tests Automatically on PR Submission

- Run corresponding tests based on the scope of changed files

- Only merge the PR after the tests have passed.

**CD:**

- Google Apps Script Web App (CD Packaging Interface) allows engineers, QA, and PMs to package the app on computers or mobile devices through this website.

- GitHub Actions Self-hosted Runner uses your own machine for unlimited CI/CD usage.

- Integrate Firebase App Distribution API to directly obtain the download link for the packaged test version.

**Automation** :

- Auto-assign self on PR creation

- Assign Reviewers Automatically and Randomly When Creating a PR

- Mark PR Size Label

### What is CI/CD?

#### Story — Development Process Without CI/CD

Before discussing what CI/CD actually is, let's set aside the term "CI/CD" and first recall how a startup development team without any workflow implemented would typically operate. The general process is roughly illustrated in the diagram below:

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*rg4hbs7MsYDU9HZoehrvjQ.png)

1. There is a bug in the product. Developer T creates a branch fix/bug-c from the main branch to fix it, then merges the fix back into the main branch.

2. Next, Developer Z branches off feature/a from the main branch to work on requirement A. Halfway through, they notice something is wrong with the feature. **After checking, they find that the current functionality was broken and tests failed**, so they inform Developer T to fix it.

3. After all development is complete, Developer Z **uses his computer to build the version for QA testing, repeatedly fixing and packaging**. Once everything is confirmed, the feature is merged back into the main branch.

4. At the end of the sprint, it's time to package and release to users; Developer Z **puts aside current tasks** to help package from the main branch for QA to perform regression testing, similarly **going back and forth fixing issues and repackaging**. After completion, the app is packaged for submission.

5. Release to users after Apple/Google review is completed.

#### Problem

In the story above, we can summarize two major issues.

**Question 1: There is no unified inspection mechanism for current correct feature changes.**

- Code That Does Not Meet the Coding Style Can Still Be Merged

- I Can Merge Even If the Build Fails

- After changes, basic Unit Tests and key checks can fail but still be merged.

- My environment works correctly, but others may not have the same results.

- Affecting other developers who are currently working

**Question 2: Spending a lot of manpower and time on packaging tasks.**

- Packaging requires engineers to manually package, interrupting their current development work.

- Switching between packaging and development causes high cognitive load.

- Packaging wait time blocks other development tasks.

- Engineer time costs money.

- Manual operations may lead to errors.

- QA must ask engineers to package (causing back-and-forth communication).

#### CI — Continuous Integration (持續整合)

Corresponding to Question 1, "Continuous Integration" aims to ensure that all changes automatically run Build & Test in a unified environment, guaranteeing that modifications pass all test cases and meet team standards before entering production — "continuously and automatically ensuring correct code integration into the production environment."

You can also add Nightly Builds and more automated testing steps to ensure stability.

#### CD — Continuous Delivery / Deployment

For Question 2, "Continuous Deployment" aims to automatically complete the complex packaging and deployment process after the code passes the CI stage without errors, delivering the changes to internal testing (QA, Debug, Staging, Beta…) or external release (Production, Release…).

- **Continuous Deployment:** Fully automated deployment directly to the Production environment

- **Continuous Delivery:** Automatically deploy only to the Staging/Debug environment; manual verification is required before deploying to the Production environment.

In the context of App development, it leans more towards **Continuous Delivery**, where we want a manual check before the App is officially released to ensure the release timing and functionality are correct.

#### Story — **Building a Stable and Efficient Development Team through CI/CD**

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*rszgT5yFKCcfCUka_t9b3g.png)

**Looking back at our story, after implementing CI/CD:**

- CI  
  All changes must pass automated tests before merging into the main branch. A Nightly Build with scheduled automated tests is added to improve stability.

- CD  
  Using CD packaging uniformly, Developer T and Developer Z can fully focus on business development, reducing manual communication and operational errors.

> Team Work Efficiency and Product Stability 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

### The Value of CI/CD

Combining the core Agile principle of "small steps, fast iterations," CI/CD provides the foundation for stability and work efficiency during frequent continuous feature iterations.

**Automatically Standardize Verification of Iteration Results**

- Ensure all adjustments meet the expected results, do not affect other functions, and do not impact other team members.

**Automate Tedious Deployment Processes**

- Allow team members to focus on core business development and reduce human operational errors

#### CI/CD Effectiveness

Looking back at the 2021 Pinkoi talk "[**2021 Pinkoi Tech Career Talk — Secrets of High-Efficiency Engineering Teams**](../11f6c8568154/)," the core message was essentially the same: "automation, reducing human dependencies, and focusing on core business." Implementing CI/CD fully aligns with these three directions, allowing us to estimate its effectiveness using the same approach.

**Another point to highlight is the [cost of context switching](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BF%83%E6%B5%81%E7%90%86%E8%AB%96){:target="_blank"}:**

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*xOzjG-lSiFmdT-C4GHf0JA.png)

After working continuously for a period, we enter a "flow" state, where our thoughts and productivity peak, enabling the most effective output. However, if interrupted, it takes time to return to this flow state—here, we use 30 minutes as an example.

**In scenarios without CI/CD, it might be:** spending a lot of time only to find out something was broken, then going back to communicate and fix it (CI), and QA/PM asking engineers to help package the test version of the app (CD).

#### CI/CD Effectiveness Estimation

![Team size: 6 people / calculated over one month](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*SinoHlHKbtXiRubUS8Bm9Q.png)

Team size: 6 people / calculated per month

Here, we use a monthly basis as an example. Without a CI/CD process, there are 4 incidents per month where the main branch is accidentally broken, causing about 720 minutes of fixing and communication costs. Additionally, monthly packaging of test and release versions, along with errors caused by manual operations, add up to about 1,010 minutes. With an engineer’s monthly salary of 80,000, this results in approximately 13,000 in wasted costs each month.

> *Missed estimating [Starting 2026–03–01, Self-hosted will require a maintenance fee of $0.002 USD per minute](https://resources.github.com/actions/2026-pricing-changes-for-github-actions/){:target="_blank"}, which means running for 500 minutes costs $1 USD.*

#### CI/CD **Setup Cost**

- Labor Cost:  
  Based on this series, it is estimated that 1 person spending 10 days = **4,800 minutes** can complete the setup. (~= **NT$36,384**)

- Device and Operating Costs:  
  Using GitHub Actions self-hosted Runner only requires purchasing 1–2 [Mac Minis](https://www.apple.com/tw/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini/m4){:target="_blank"} upfront or using existing retired MacBook Pros as CI/CD Runners for service.  
  For example, a 6-person team purchasing a brand new Mac Mini: 32G RAM M4 Mini (= **NT$40,900**)

The total cost is about **NT$80,000**, with benefits starting to be realized after about six months.

> ***Disclaimer:*** *This is just one way to calculate benefits and may not be the most accurate; it is meant to give everyone a concept to extend, **allowing management to see the value of CI/CD** and thus authorize the promotion and completion of the entire workflow.*

### Tool Selection for CI/CD

#### Cloud Services Bitrise / XCode Cloud

- **Bitrise:** One of the earliest cloud services focused on providing App CI/CD. My first experience with CI/CD was using Bitrise. It offers a user-friendly and intuitive step editor, allowing quick setup of App CI/CD workflows.  
  **Drawbacks:** Initially, it was a $99 flat rate. When Apple’s M-series processors were released, they switched to usage-based billing (a "bait and switch" tactic). At that time, our team’s usage cost at least $500 per month, so we migrated to GitHub Actions.  
  However, recently checking their website, they now offer 1 App / 1 Concurrent / unlimited usage / $89 per month.

- **XCode Cloud:** 100 hours / 1 month / $50 USD. The advantage is its deep integration with XCode and app development; however, the downside is it does not support Android, and customizing certain steps can be difficult. Still, for small pure iOS apps, I would consider using it again.

> *Really worried about **cloud services turning into a subscription trap**, so considering on-premise services for better control.*

#### On-Premise Services Jenkins / GitHub Actions / Gitlab CI/CD

- **Gitlab CI/CD:**  
  It was launched before GitHub Actions and provides more complete features. However, since our project is hosted on GitHub, we do not consider using Gitlab CI/CD. Both have similar functions, and this series will use GitHub Actions as an example.

- **GitHub Actions**  
  GitHub launched its CI/CD service in 2018, fully integrated with GitHub projects. It has continuously improved over the years, offering many pre-built steps ([Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions){:target="_blank"}) ready to use. It supports self-hosted runners, allowing unlimited use of your own machines (effectively a hybrid cloud).

- **Jenkins:**  
  An open-source, free tool dedicated to CI/CD. It is old but powerful; Jenkins covers everything from application-level task design and permission management to underlying service dispatch and execution. It also has [Plugins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/){:target="_blank"} that can be used directly and was a key tool for early DevOps CI/CD.

### Jenkins v.s. GitHub Actions

#### **TL;DR**

> *For an App Team without dedicated DevOps, expecting developers to set up and maintain a Jenkins environment from scratch is too challenging, with few people skilled enough and potential network security issues. Choosing GitHub Actions allows developers to focus solely on designing the CI/CD process. By briefly reviewing the official documentation on writing workflows and starting Runners, they can quickly build a free, stable, and secure CI/CD service.*

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*qg8SkzoJqNVvWPxx2Lh6uA.png)

> *The following comparison is based solely on setting up App CI/CD and may not apply to all technical scenarios.*

#### **Setup and Maintenance Difficulty** Jenkins >>> GitHub Actions

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*k2XGXjV_VZEt618DnDm0lA.png)

Here is a simple layered diagram to explain the difference between the two. As mentioned before, Jenkins covers all functions from top to bottom, making self-hosting much more complex. In contrast, GitHub Actions only requires writing YAML workflows on GitHub. The local machine just needs to register the GitHub self-hosted Runner (completed with 5 commands), and GitHub will automatically dispatch tasks to the local machine. Other matters, such as upgrading GitHub Actions/Runner versions or task dispatch issues, are maintained by GitHub, so we do not need to handle them.

Another troublesome point is that Jenkins is a service independent of Git, so communication between them requires APIs (e.g., GitHub API/WebHook), making the setup more complicated.

I previously surveyed about 30 iOS developers around me; only a handful (2) understood Jenkins, while more than 10 were using GitHub Actions. After all, you can complete CI/CD tasks just by writing some YAML.

#### Learning Difficulty Jenkins >>> GitHub Actions

Refer only to the official documentation to learn GitHub Actions YAML commands and how to set up your own Runner locally.

#### Stability: GitHub Actions > Jenkins

In this aspect, I think GitHub Actions slightly outperforms Jenkins.

Jenkins may crash due to system upgrades or installing conflicting plugins (but if it runs smoothly and you don't touch it, it basically has no issues).

GitHub Actions depends on [GitHub Service Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/){:target="_blank"} (if GitHub is down, it will be affected too), but outages are rare, with an average uptime of 99.9%. If issues occur, just wait for them to be fixed.

#### Security: GitHub Actions > Jenkins

Considering that GitHub Actions/Runner services are maintained and automatically updated by GitHub itself, this may be safer compared to Jenkins, which requires manual updates.

Additionally, communication between Jenkins and GitHub requires opening API/WebHook ports, which is relatively risky. GitHub and GitHub Actions integrate seamlessly, and the interaction between GitHub Actions and the self-hosted Runner follows an observer pattern. The self-hosted Runner pulls tasks from GitHub, so the Runner itself does not need to expose any external interfaces.

However, in a fully closed network environment, Jenkins is more secure than GitHub Actions.

#### Permission Management Jenkins >>> GitHub Actions

This point needs special comparison: Jenkins allows separate account login permissions for control; GitHub Actions is directly tied to the GitHub Repo, so only those with repo permissions can use it.

> **That is why the following articles use GAS Web App to build a cross-team operation platform.**

#### Moving from Jenkins to GitHub Actions at Scale

In teams with a complete DevOps team, Jenkins is undoubtedly still the preferred choice. After all, in other fields (such as Web, backend, Java…), Jenkins has been running the longest, offers the most useful plugins, and can unify the CI/CD setup for all teams, making management easier. It also supports complex CI/CD scenarios like automatic frontend deployment after backend deployment.

> **GitHub Actions later also supports cross-repo Actions/Runner.**

#### Third-Party Plugin Availability Jenkins > GitHub Actions

In terms of quantity, GitHub Actions outnumber Jenkins, but Jenkins offers deeper and more powerful CI/CD features. Many of GitHub Actions are simply automation functions.

#### Feature Depth Jenkins >>> GitHub Actions

This aspect is unmatched; Jenkins has been around for nearly 20 years, while GitHub Actions still needs to add many features. For example: permission management, secret management (currently only plain text is supported, so key files must be converted to plain text first), Cache/Artifact currently only supports Cloud, and so on.

**Additionally, GitHub Self-hosted Runner also supports [Docker or k8s](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/runners/about-actions-runner-controller#scaling-runners){:target="_blank"}.**

#### Customized Deep Jenkins >>> GitHub Actions

Jenkins is fully controlled in-house, allowing greater customization of permissions that can affect the entire system. GitHub Actions can only customize different steps at the application level.

For example, since the built-in Artifacts in GitHub Actions do not support self-hosted runners, you can only use a sh copy command in the steps to move files to another directory, and cannot customize Artifacts on your own.

> **App CI/CD scenarios do not require very advanced features.**

#### Usability GitHub Actions >>> Jenkins

On the interface side, GitHub Actions is a newer tool and is easier to use than Jenkins;  
In terms of script configuration, Jenkins uses Pipeline Scripts stored on Jenkins, while GitHub Actions uses YAML files managed within the project’s Git repository, making it easier to set up than Jenkins.

#### Cost Risk Jenkins > GitHub Actions

Jenkins is fully open-source and free to use, while GitHub Actions is partially open-source but its task dispatching and execution run on GitHub's closed SaaS service. Currently, GitHub Actions is completely free; fees apply only when using GitHub-hosted Runners. Starting from 2026-03-01, self-hosted Runners will also incur a maintenance fee of $0.002 USD per minute. Public repositories have free usage quotas for these charges.

### Purpose of Google Apps Script Web App and Why It Was Chosen

Another tool choice is Google Apps Script Web App. The reason for adding this is that GitHub Actions' built-in form feature is too basic (the interface is too technical and static), and its execution permissions are tied to the GitHub Repo. This makes it very inconvenient to provide access to other functional team members.

**As follows:**

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*kULMefCX5D6I5z9xt71A5A.png)

CD packaging usually requires the operator to fill in some information, such as Release Notes.

Therefore, we need an "interface" tool to provide to other team members or even to make it easier for our own engineers to use.

**Required Scenario:**

> *Fill in the required information on this more user-friendly "interface," connect to project management tools (e.g., Jira, Asana) to get tasks, or directly fetch the PR list from GitHub. Select from the dropdown menu and submit, then trigger GitHub Actions for packaging via the GitHub API.*

#### Slack

The first time we implemented CI/CD, we chose to integrate with the Slack API to achieve a similar effect:

![<https://slack.com/intl/zh-tw/blog/productivity/workflow-builder-tools-automation-examples>{:target="_blank"}](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*m85bTTlrwAmCxoVqVXo2fg.png)

<https://slack.com/intl/zh-tw/blog/productivity/workflow-builder-tools-automation-examples>{:target="_blank"}

- Partners can directly fill out forms in Slack to trigger CD packaging and receive Slack notifications

The operation is smooth and unified within daily office tools (SSOT), requiring no relearning; however, the underlying issue is **very high development and maintenance costs**. One reason is that Slack Outgoing-Webhook API demands a very fast response (within 3 seconds), which basically rules out using simple FAAS services for integration (e.g., Cloud Functions, GAS, Lambda…).

**Previously, a team member interested in automation and backend development created a complete backend service using Kotlin + ktor, then deployed a server on GCP for Slack integration.**

> ***Development and maintenance costs are extremely high, and handover is difficult.***

#### Google Apps Script — Web App

Previously shared "[Using Google Apps Script Web App Form to Integrate Github Action CI/CD Workflow](../4cb4437818f2/)":

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*Gr4PnV2J2AB9cVFuXMLjcA.png)

![[Demo Web App Form URL](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwNW6N5ozKbIz_E1HK6yFEUtA8KQrUciS-jcPsQptvIKlARmKgLxbQzNu8ksVeg-BmEfg/exec){:target="_blank"}](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*NJRcY2ULVylZlsKnBtM27A.png)

**The advantages of using Google Apps Script — Web App are:**

- Website Web

- With Google Workspace enterprise account permission management, access can be restricted to only Google accounts within the organization.

- **Completely Free**

- **Function as a Service requires no self-hosted server maintenance**

- Easier to maintain and hand over

- Operable on mobile devices

- **AI Can Help!**  
  **Whether it's ChatGPT or other AI tools, they are very familiar with GAS and can directly help us create packaging forms and connect to the GitHub API.**

- Can also integrate with Jira, Asana, and Slack notification APIs

For the second promotion, I switched to using a GAS Web App for the team, which also received great feedback. The only difference from Slack is that you need to bookmark one more URL. When packaging is needed, just open the URL and operate the packaging through the web form.

### Complete App CI/CD Tool Workflow

Here is the complete workflow. The next article will gradually introduce how to use and integrate each tool.

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*pQ-2Jj6s2qlvwTrLghJSjg.png)

#### Tool Roles:

- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD workflow script code

- **GitHub Actions — Self-hosted Runner**: The actual environment where CI/CD runs, using a self-hosted runner. You only need to cover the machine cost and can run tasks without usage limits.

- **Google Apps Script Web App**: Since packaging is not always done by engineers, a platform is needed for cross-functional team members; GAS Web App can quickly create a web tool and share the URL for others to use.

- **Asana/Jira**: Project management tools that integrate with the GAS Web App, allowing QA/PM to directly select tasks to package.

- **Slack**: Used to receive execution result notifications

#### Scenario:

- End-User (QA/PM/PD/Developer): Submit the packaging form using GAS Web App (fetch the Branch corresponding to the Jira or Asana task) -> GAS calls GitHub API -> triggers CD packaging GitHub Actions <- GitHub self-hosted runner listens for the task and pulls it to the machine for execution -> upon completion, Slack notification is sent and GAS Web App packaging status is updated.

- End-User (Developer): Open PR, push new commit to PR -> trigger CI testing process <- GitHub self-hosted runner listens for tasks and pulls them to the machine for execution -> after completion, comment test results and update Checks.

### Summary

This article mainly provides an introduction to what CI/CD is and the benefits it brings. Starting from the next article, we will dive into the technical aspects, guiding you step-by-step to understand and implement GitHub Actions CI/CD until the final result described earlier is achieved.
