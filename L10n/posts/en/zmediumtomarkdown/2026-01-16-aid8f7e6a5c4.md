### Introduction

In today's digital age, whether opening an online bank account, filing taxes online, or applying for various government services, identity verification is increasingly required. The "Citizen Digital Certificate" acts like your ID card in the online world and is essential for many online transactions. For example, when using pure online banks like LINE Bank, since there are no physical branches, increasing transfer limits or setting up authorized accounts must be done through online verification with the Citizen Digital Certificate, making it an indispensable part of digital financial services.

This article will guide you step-by-step through the application process for the Citizen Digital Certificate, so you no longer have to be confused by complicated procedures.

### What is the Citizen Digital Certificate?

At the counter, the staff will ask you to set a **PIN code (certificate password)**, which should be 6-10 digits long. This password is required whenever you use the certificate in the future, so please remember it carefully.

### How to Use the Citizen Digital Certificate?

After obtaining the Citizen Digital Certificate, you can authenticate your identity online using the following two main methods:

#### Method 1: Use with a Card Reader on a Computer

This is the most traditional and common way to use it.

1. **Prepare an IC Card Reader:** You need to purchase a compatible IC card reader first.

2. **Install Drivers:** Connect the card reader to the computer and install the necessary drivers according to the manual.

3. **Using the Certificate:** When you need to verify your identity on declaration websites (such as online tax filing) or internet banking, follow the website prompts to insert your Citizen Digital Certificate card and enter your PIN code.

#### Method 2: Use Mobile Phone NFC Function for Authentication

In recent years, many apps (especially financial service apps like LINE Bank) have supported directly using the phone's NFC function to read the Natural Person Certificate, eliminating the need for a card reader.

**Using LINE Bank as an example:**

When the app requests Natural Person Certificate verification, it usually opens a sensing page.

Next, you need to place the Citizen Digital Certificate card near the phone's NFC sensing area to complete the verification.

> **Mobile NFC Tips:**
> 
> - **iPhone:** The NFC sensing area is at the top of the phone (near the front camera). Place the card horizontally at the top of the phone.
> 
> - **Android:** The NFC sensing area location varies by brand, usually near the logo on the back. Refer to the phone manual or try different spots.
> 
> - **Sensing Issue:** The sensing range of the Citizen Digital Certificate is sometimes limited. If it doesn't work initially, slowly move the card near the sensing area or slightly adjust its angle and try again.
