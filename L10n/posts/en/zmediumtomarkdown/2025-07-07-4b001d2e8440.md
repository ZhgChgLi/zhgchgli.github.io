#### Preface

In the previous article "[**CI/CD Practical Guide (Part 2): Complete Guide to Using and Setting up GitHub Actions with Self-hosted Runner**](../404bd5c70040/)," we introduced the basics of GitHub Actions, its workflow, and how to use your own machine as a Runner, guiding you through three simple automated Actions. **This article will focus deeply on building an App (iOS) CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions in real-world scenarios**, walking you through each step while supplementing your GitHub Actions knowledge.

### App CI/CD Workflow Diagram

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*VRygfRAkBRNEDAC4RyGzRA.png)

This article focuses on the GitHub Actions section for building CI/CD. The next article, "[CI/CD Practical Guide (Part 4): Using Google Apps Script Web App to Connect with GitHub Actions to Build a Free and Easy Packaging Tool Platform](../4273e57e7148/)," will introduce the latter part about using Google Apps Script Web App to build a cross-team collaboration packaging platform.

#### Workflow:

1. GitHub Actions Triggered by Pull Request or Form or Scheduled

2. Run Corresponding Workflow Jobs/Steps

3. Step Executes Corresponding Fastlane (iOS) or (Android Gradle) Script

4. Fastlane Executes Corresponding xcodebuild (iOS) Commands

5. Get the Execution Result

6. Subsequent Workflow Jobs/Steps Handle Results

7. Completed

#### GitHub Actions Result Screenshots

First, let's show the final result to give everyone some practical motivation!

### GitHub Actions x Self-hosted Runner Basics

If you are not yet familiar with GitHub Actions and setting up a Self-hosted Runner, it is highly recommended to first read the previous article "[**CI/CD Practical Guide (Part 2): Complete Guide to Using and Setting up GitHub Actions and Self-hosted Runner**](../404bd5c70040/)" or implement it together with the knowledge from that article.

> ***Implementation begins!***

### Infra Architecture of the iOS Demo Project

[![](https://opengraph.githubassets.com/ac0aa481002311af0e60721a17f7533f54be5d308c641c48ea717e12a1f3d725/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo)](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo){:target="_blank"}

**The iOS project content used in this article, including test items, is generated by AI**, so there is no need to focus on iOS code details. The discussion is limited to Infra & CI/CD aspects.

> ***The following tools are based on past experience; for new projects, consider using the newer [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise){:target="_blank"} and [tuist](https://github.com/tuist/tuist){:target="_blank"}.***

#### Mint

[![](https://opengraph.githubassets.com/5b9cf093f4868403ac9212a468eda99979267fe5e14c7dd1ce13c3b42b875f5f/yonaskolb/Mint)](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint){:target="_blank"}

Mint helps us unify the management of dependency tool versions (Gemfile can only manage Ruby Gems), such as XCodeGen, SwiftFormat, SwiftLint, and Periphery.

…etc

**Mintfile:**

```graphql
yonaskolb/Mint@0.17.5
yonaskolb/XcodeGen@2.35.0
nicklockwood/SwiftFormat@0.51.13
```

Here we only use three.

> ***If it feels too complicated, you can skip this and directly install the required tools using brew install in the Action Workflow Step.***

#### Bundle

**Gemfile:**

```bash
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'cocoapods', '~>1.16.0'
gem 'fastlane', '~>2.228.0'

plugins_path = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'Product', 'fastlane', 'Pluginfile')
eval_gemfile(plugins_path) if File.exist?(plugins_path)
```

Managing Ruby (Gems) dependencies, the most commonly used ones in iOS projects are `cocoapods` and `fastlane`.

#### Cocoapods

**Product/podfile:**

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo' do
  pod 'SnapKit'
end 
```

Although it has been announced as [deprecated](https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Specs-Repo/){:target="_blank"}, Cocoapods is still common in older iOS projects. Here, we simply add Snapkit as a demo.

#### XCodeGen

To avoid conflicts caused by changes to `.xcodeproj` / `.xcworkspace` during multi-developer collaboration, unify the XCode Project definition using Project.yaml, then generate the Project files locally (do not commit them to Git).

**Product/project.yaml:**

```yaml
name: app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo
options:
  bundleIdPrefix: com.example
  deploymentTarget:
    iOS: '13.0'
  usesTabs: false
  indentWidth: 2

packages:
  SnapshotTesting:
    url: https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing
    from: 1.18.4
```

SnapshotTesting: Managed with Swift Package Manager.

#### Fastlane

Encapsulate complex steps such as xcodebuild commands, integrating with App Store Connect API, Firebase API, and other services.

**Product/fastlane/Fastfile:**

```php

default_platform(:ios)

platform :ios do
  desc "Run all tests (Unit Tests + UI Tests)"
  lane :run_all_tests do \\|options\\|
    device = options[:device]
    scan(
      scheme: "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo",
      device: device,
      clean: true,
      output_directory: "fastlane/test_output",
      output_types: "junit"
    )
  end

  desc "Run only Unit Tests"
  lane :run_unit_tests do \\|options\\|
    device = options[:device]
    scan(
      scheme: "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo",
      device: device,
      clean: true,
      only_testing: [
        "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demoTests"
      ],
      output_directory: "fastlane/test_output",
      output_types: "junit"
    )
  end

  desc "Build and upload to Firebase App Distribution"
  lane :beta do \\|options\\|
    
    if options[:version_number] && options[:version_number].to_s.strip != ""
      increment_version_number(version_number: options[:version_number])
    end

    if options[:build_number] && options[:build_number].to_s.strip != ""
      increment_build_number(build_number: options[:build_number])
    end

    update_code_signing_settings(
      use_automatic_signing: false,
      path: "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo.xcodeproj",
      team_id: ENV['TEAM_ID'],
      code_sign_identity: "iPhone Developer",
      sdk: "iphoneos*",
      profile_name: "cicd"
    )

    gym(
      scheme: "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo",
      clean: true,
      export_method: "development",
      output_directory: "fastlane/build",
      output_name: "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo.ipa",
      export_options: {
          provisioningProfiles: {
            "com.test.appcicdgithubactionsdemo" => "cicd",
          },
      }
    )

    firebase_app_distribution(
      app: "1:127683058219:ios:98896929fa131c7a80686e",
      firebase_cli_token: ENV["FIREBASE_CLI_TOKEN"],
      release_notes: options[:release_notes] \\|\\| "New beta build"
    )
  end
end
```

Note: provisioningProfiles and profile_name correspond to the [Profiles certificate names in App Developer](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list){:target="_blank"}. (If using match, these specifications are not needed.)

**Fastlane is an essential part of iOS CI/CD**, allowing you to quickly develop the actual CI/CD execution steps using its pre-packaged methods; we only need to focus on the overall script design without dealing with complex API integrations or command writing.

For example, Fastlane only requires writing `scan(xxx)` to run tests, whereas using xcodebuild needs `xcodebuild -workspace ./xxx.xcworkspace -scheme xxx -derivedDataPath xxx ‘platform=iOS Simulator,id=xxx’ clean build test`. Packaging and deployment are even more complicated, requiring manual integration with App Store Connect/Firebase APIs, with key authentication alone needing over 10 lines of code.

**The demo project has only three lanes:**

- run_all_tests: Run all types of tests (Snapshot + Unit)

- run_unit_tests: Run only unit tests (Unit)

- beta: Build and Deploy to Firebase App Distribution

#### Fastlane — Match

Due to the demo project limitations, Match is not used here to manage team development and deployment certificates. However, it is recommended to use Match to manage all team development and deployment certificates for easier control and unified updates.

> *With Match, you can directly use commands like `match all` in the project setup step to install all the development certificates needed in one go.*

- **Fastlane Match uses another Private Repo to manage certificate keys. In GitHub Actions, you need to set up the SSH Agent to clone the other Private Repo.**  
  (Please refer to the appendix at the end)

#### Makefile

![Makefile](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*jYACUYFP3MkeHCgeUY7j3w.png)

Makefile

Unify the development side and CI/CD to use Makefile for executing commands, making it easier to encapsulate the same environment, paths, and operations.

> *A classic case is that some people use the locally installed `pod install`, while others use `bundle exec pod install` managed by Bundler. Differences in versions may cause discrepancies.*

> ***If you find it too complicated, you can skip it and simply write the commands to execute directly in the Action Workflow Step.***

**Makefile:**

```makefile
#!make
PRODUCT_FOLDER = ./Product/
SHELL         := /bin/zsh
.DEFAULT_GOAL := install
MINT_DIRECTORY := ./mint/

export MINT_PATH=$(MINT_DIRECTORY)

## 👇 Help function
.PHONY: help
help:
 @echo ""
 @echo "📖 Available commands:"
 @grep -E '^[a-zA-Z_-]+:.*?## .*$$' $(MAKEFILE_LIST) \\| \
  awk 'BEGIN {FS = ":.*?## "}; {printf "  \033[36m%-20s\033[0m %s\n", $$1, $$2}'
 @echo ""

## Setup
.PHONY: setup
setup: check-mint ## Install Ruby and Mint dependencies
 @echo "🔨 Installing Ruby dependencies..."
 bundle config set path 'vendor/bundle'
 bundle install
 @echo "🔨 Installing Mint dependencies..."
 mint bootstrap

## Install
.PHONY: install
install: XcodeGen PodInstall ## Run XcodeGen and CocoaPods install

.PHONY: XcodeGen
XcodeGen: check-mint ## Generate .xcodeproj using XcodeGen
 @echo "🔨 Execute XcodeGen"
 cd $(PRODUCT_FOLDER) && \
 mint run yonaskolb/XcodeGen --quiet

.PHONY: PodInstall
PodInstall: ## Install CocoaPods dependencies
 @echo "📦 Installing CocoaPods dependencies..."
 cd $(PRODUCT_FOLDER) && \
 bundle exec pod install

### Mint
check-mint: check-brew ## Check if Mint is installed, install if missing
 @if ! command -v mint &> /dev/null; then \
  echo "🔨 Installing mint..."; \
  brew install mint; \
 fi

### Brew
check-brew: ## Check if Homebrew is installed, install if missing
 @if ! command -v brew &> /dev/null; then \
  echo "🔨 Installing Homebrew..."; \
  /bin/bash -c "$$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"; \
 fi

## Format only git swift files
.PHONY: format
format: check-mint ## Format all Swift files under Product/
 mint run swiftformat $(PRODUCT_FOLDER)
```

To avoid contaminating the entire system or other projects, we try to specify the paths of dependency packages (e.g., mint, bundle, etc.) within the project directory (combined with `.gitignore` exclusion).

```scss
├── mint (Mint dependencies)
│   └── packages
├── Product
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo.xcodeproj
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo.xcworkspace
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demoSnapshotTests
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demoTests
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demoUITests
│   ├── fastlane
│   └── Pods (Cocoapods dependencies)
└── vendor (Bundle dependencies)
    └── bundle
```

make help

**Unified Project Setup Steps Using Makefine:**

1. `git clone repo`

2. `cd ./repo`

3. `make setup`  
   Install necessary tool dependencies (**brew**, **mint**, **bundle**, xcodegen, swiftformat, …)

4. `make install`  
   Generate the project (run pod install, xcodegen)

5. Completed

6. Open and Run the Project

> ***Whether for CI/CD or onboarding new members, follow the above steps to set up the project.***

### This GitHub Actions CI/CD Example

This article introduces three GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow examples. You can also refer to these steps to build a CI/CD process that fits your team's workflow.

1. CI — Run Unit Tests on Pull Request

2. CD — Build + Deploy to Firebase App Distribution

3. CI + CD — Nightly Build Running Snapshot + Unit Tests + Packaging + Deployment to Firebase App Distribution

> *Due to demo limitations, this article only covers packaging and deploying to Firebase App Distribution. Packaging for Testflight or the App Store follows the same steps, with the only difference being the scripts used in Fastlane. Feel free to adapt as needed.*

### CI — Run Unit Tests on Pull Request

#### Workflow

The Develop branch **cannot be pushed to directly**; updates must be done via Pull Requests. All Pull Requests **require review approval and passing unit tests before merging**, and any new commit push will trigger retesting.

#### CI-Testing.yml

Repo → Actions → New workflow → set up a workflow yourself.

```yaml
# Workflow(Action) Name
name: CI-Testing

# Actions Log Title
run-name: "[CI-Testing] ${{ github.event.pull_request.title \\|\\| github.ref }}"

# Cancel running jobs in the same Concurrency Group if a new job starts
# For example, if a new push commit triggers a job before the previous one finishes, the previous job is canceled
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event_name }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number \\|\\| github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

      # We manually specify XCode_x.x.x.app later
      # Not using xcversion since it is sunset and unstable

          echo "xcode_version=${XCODE_VERSION}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

          # You can also set global XCode version here to avoid specifying DEVELOPER_DIR later
          # But this requires sudo privileges; self-hosted runners must have sudo access
          # sudo xcode-select -s "/Applications/Xcode_${XCODE_VERSION}.app/Contents/Developer"

      # Read project specified Ruby version
      - name: Read .ruby-version

      # Optional: previously for self-hosted runners running multiple CI/CD jobs,
      # cocoapods repos share directory causing rare conflicts during simultaneous pod install
      # GitHub Hosted Runners do not need this
      # - name: Change Cocoapods Repos Folder
      #   if: contains(runner.labels, 'self-hosted')
      #   run: \\|
      #     # Each runner uses its own .cocoapods folder to avoid conflicts

      # ========== Cache Setting Steps ==========
      # Note: Even for self-hosted, cache is cloud-based and usage counts
      # Rules: auto delete after 7 days no hit, max 10GB per cache, only cache on success
      # Public Repo: free unlimited
      # Private Repo: starts at 5GB
      # Self-hosted can implement own cache/restore with shell scripts or other tools

**Technical Highlights:**

- runs-on: It is recommended to use a self-hosted Runner, as [GitHub Hosted Runner macOS is very expensive](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/about-billing-for-github-actions#per-minute-rates){:target="_blank"}.

- Manually read the `.xcode-version` file to get the specified XCode version and set the `DEVELOPER_DIR` env in steps that require a specific XCode. This allows easy switching of XCode without needing Sudo.

- Cache: Can speed up dependency installation, but note that even self-hosted Runners use GitHub Cloud Cache, which is subject to billing limits.

- Use `set +e` so the script won't exit immediately on command failure + redirect all output to a file + read the file to determine if it is Build Failed or Test Failed; otherwise, the message will always be Test Failed.  
  You can also extend this to detect other errors, for example: `Underlying Error: Unable to boot the Simulator.` means the simulator failed to start, please try again.

- Checkout Code accepts specifying a branch: Since the `on: schedule` event can only trigger on the main (default) branch, if we want the schedule to operate on another branch, we need to specify the branch.

- Specifying the .cocoapods Repo path is optional. Previously, we encountered an issue where two Runners on the same self-hosted machine both got stuck at pod install because they were accessing the .cocoapods Repo simultaneously, causing a git lock.  
  (However, this is a rare occurrence.)

- **If you have a Private Pods Repo, you need to set up an SSH Agent to have permission to clone.**  
  **(Please refer to the supplementary notes at the end)**

- Remember to add in Repo -> Settings -> Actions secrets and variables -> variables:  
  `SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION` Simulator iOS version  
  `SIMULATOR_NAME` Simulator name

Continue with the correct subsequent settings.

#### GitHub Workflow Setup

Repo → Settings → Rules → Rulesets.

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*cf_M6NnakdcbzvC2VHSfpw.png)

- Ruleset Name: Ruleset Name

- Enforcement status: Enable/Disable this rule restriction

- Target branches: The target Base branches. Setting the Default Branch means all branches intended to merge into main or develop are subject to this rule.

- Bypass list: You can specify special identities or Teams that are exempt from this limit

- Branch rules:

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*Hzd9CCTsu18kyDR1goRWag.png)

- Restrict deletions: Prohibit branch deletion

- Require a pull request before merging: Only allow merging via PR  
  Required approvals: Limit the number of required approvals

- Require status checks to pass: Restrict which checks must pass before merging  
  Click + Add checks, type `Testing`, and select the one with the GitHub Actions icon.  
  **There is a small issue here: if Suggestions** **cannot find `Testing`, you need to go back to Actions and trigger it (try opening a PR) to succeed once, then it will appear here.**

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*MRPwUEVVbbz8nH0sS2hFfQ.png)

- Block force pushes: Disable force push

After saving and confirming the Enforcement status is Active, the rule will take effect.

**After everything is set up, open a PR to test it:**

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*iPETBWx6Boq12rY1fHXmuQ.png)

- If you see CI-Testing (**Required**), Merging is blocked, and At least X approving review is required by reviewers with write access, it means the setup is successful.

**If the project build fails (Build Failed), it will Comment:**

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*4E35VRPo--pI8uqrR4UZNA.png)

**If the project builds successfully but test cases fail (Test Failed), it will Comment:**

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*wYFzsn5a_yvi8CbZxi-QdQ.png)

**If the project build and tests succeed (Test Success), it will Comment:**

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*WqPK1629jYdYTEWCWBHWqg.png)

**After completing Review Approve + passing Check tests:**

![[Demo PR](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/pull/11){:target="_blank"}](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*5gnQYdVAOtGR-bMK4ZrOhA.png)

[Demo PR](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/pull/11){:target="_blank"}

Then you can merge the PR.

- If a new commit is pushed, the Checks tests will automatically rerun.

**Full code: [CI-Testing.yml](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/CI-Testing.yml){:target="_blank"}**

**Auto-merge:**

Also, you can enable the following in Repo Settings → General → Pull Request:

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*hl6mfqnnv_zAA3YVrI_M0w.png)

- Automatically delete head branches: Automatically delete branches after merging PRs

- Allow Auto-merge: Automatically merge the PR when Checks pass and required Approvals are met.  
  **The Enable auto-merge button only appears if conditions are set and the current conditions do not yet allow merging.**

### CD — Build + Deploy to Firebase App Distribution

#### Workflow

Using GitHub Actions form trigger to package the build, you can specify the version number and Release Notes. After packaging, it will automatically upload to Firebase App Distribution for the team to download and test.

#### CD-Deploy.yml

Repo → Actions → New workflow → set up a workflow yourself.

#### Technical Details — Obtaining & Setting Firebase CLI Token

According to the [Firebase official documentation steps](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli?hl=zh-tw#install-cli-mac-linux){:target="_blank"}:

First, install the Firebase CLI tool:

```bash
curl -sL https://firebase.tools \\| bash
```

Execute:

```bash
firebase login:ci
```

Complete login and authorization:

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*Jex5aYzRSs7Trfx6z_e1Aw.png)

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*S-1ckn9WC6j0DIqZGSdUUg.png)

Return to the Terminal and copy the Firebase CLI Token:

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*sa_h8L08JbeC2nA0kACQtQ.png)

Go to Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a new Secret: `FIREBASE_CLI_TOKEN` and paste the Firebase CLI Token.

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*Lc6yGPu7L_0z6u1HH2PB5A.png)

> ***This Token = your login identity*** *Please keep it safe. If the account holder leaves, it must be replaced.*

#### Technical Details — Install the Apple certificate and provisioning profile

Additional details on importing development certificates into the Runner.

Since GitHub Actions Secrets cannot store files, all credential files must first be converted to Base64 encoded text and stored in Secrets. In the GitHub Actions steps, they are dynamically read, written to TEMP files, and then moved to the correct locations for the system to use.

**Packaging Development requires two key certificates:**

- [Provision Profile ( .mobileprovision)](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list){:target="_blank"}

- [Development Certificate ( .p12)](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list){:target="_blank"}

![cicd.mobileprovision](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*WXqqnErto3nn8rnNg6TXgw.png)

cicd.mobileprovision

![development.cer](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*RkeZ1PkXeY9Nt1kSRJKEQw.png)

development.cer

The Certificate downloaded from [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list){:target="_blank"} is in .cer format, but we need it in .p12 format. You can double-click the downloaded .cer file to install it into the Keychain, then open Keychain, right-click the certificate, and choose Export.

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*HJMxwM3IDjxT-UGqnoUtWw.png)

File name: cicd.p12, format .p12

P12 Key Password: Enter a secure custom string (the example is a bad practice, using `123456`)

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*tyH0XqDVPGPWFJPL4dxksw.png)

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*qKeZWel3w_5wW7meMtHmLA.png)

**Now two files are ready:** cicd.p12, cicd.mobileprovision

**Convert to BASE64 string and save to Repo Secrets:**

```bash
base64 -i cicd.mobileprovision \\| pbcopy
```

Go to Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → add a new Secret: `BUILD_PROVISION_PROFILE_BASE64` and paste the above content.

-

```bash
base64 -i cicd.p12 \\| pbcopy
```

Go to Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a new Secret: `BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` and paste the above content.

-

Go to Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → add a new Secret: `P12_PASSWORD` with the password used when exporting the P12 key.

-
Go to Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a new Secret: `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` ：
If using a GitHub Hosted Runner, enter any random string. **If using a Self-hosted Runner, this should be the macOS Runner user's login password**.

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*JZCkFUJCQsggqYtW8acjTw.png)

#### Technical Details — App Store Connect API Key

Fastlane deployment to App Store and Testflight requires the [mandatory .json key](https://docs.fastlane.tools/app-store-connect-api/){:target="_blank"}. Since GitHub Actions Secrets can only store strings, not files, we convert the key content into a Base64 string. In the GitHub Actions step, we dynamically read it, write it to a TEMP file, and provide the file path for Fastlane to use.

**First, go to [App Store Connect to create & download the App Store Connect API Key](../f1365e51902c/) (.p8):**

```vbnet
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
sss
axzzvcxz
zxzvzcxv
vzxcvzxvczxcvz
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Add a new `app_store_connect_api.json` file (refer to [content](https://docs.fastlane.tools/app-store-connect-api/){:target="_blank"}):

```bash
{
  "key_id": "Key ID written on App Store Connect",
  "issuer_id": "Issuer ID written on App Store Connect",
  "key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- Remember to replace line breaks with \\n -----END PRIVATE KEY-----",
  "duration": 1200, # optional (maximum 1200)
  "in_house": false # optional but may be required if using match/sigh
}
```

After saving the file, run:

```bash
base64 -i app_store_connect_api.json \\| pbcopy
```

Paste the string content into Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a new Secret: `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_BASE64` and paste the above content.

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*QxRuxEPEfWbJ383hhnxGkA.png)

After completing the `Read and Write Apple Store Connect API Key to Temp` step, just pass the env `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH` in the subsequent steps:

```yaml
- name: Deploy
  env:
    APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH: "${{ runner.temp }}/${{ env.APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_FILE_NAME }}"
  run: \\|
    ....
```

Fastlane can be used automatically.

#### Technical Extension — Reuse Action Workflow to Separate Packaging and Deployment Actions

In this case, we directly use the Fastlane `beta` lane to perform both packaging and deployment.

In real cases, we may need to deploy the same build result to different platforms (Firebase, Testflight, etc.). Therefore, a better approach is to have packaging as one Action and deployment as another Action, to avoid running the build twice; this also better aligns with the responsibilities in CI/CD.

```

#### GitHub Actions — Artifact

Regarding Cache, currently **even the Self-hosted Runner Artifact feature still goes through GitHub Cloud**, which is subject to usage limits ( [Free account starts at 500MB](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/about-billing-for-github-actions#included-storage-and-minutes){:target="_blank"} ).

> *To achieve similar results with a self-hosted runner, you can create a shared host directory or use alternative tools.*

Therefore, I currently use Artifacts only to store small data, such as Snapshot Test failure results, test reports, and so on.

### CI— Nightly Build Run Snapshot + Unit Tests + Build + CD Deployment to Firebase App Distribution

#### Workflow

Run all tests (unit + snapshot tests) automatically every day at 3 AM for the main (develop or master) branch. If the tests fail, send a failure notification to the Slack workspace; if successful, build and deploy a version to Firebase App Distribution. Notifications for both build success and failure will be sent to Slack.

We can directly install the Nightly Build version on our phones for early testing.

#### Technical Details

This Action directly reuses the previously designed CI-Testing and CD-Deploy, combining them into our Nightly Build. It is very flexible and easy to use!

### Self-hosted Runner Notes

This article uses a Public Repo, so it directly uses GitHub Hosted macOS Runners. However, in real work, our Repos are always Private. Using GitHub Hosted Runners is very expensive and not cost-effective (about the price of a Mac Mini per month, which you can set up in the office for unlimited use). Each machine can run multiple Runners concurrently depending on its performance to handle tasks.

> ***For details, please refer to the [previous article](../404bd5c70040/) section "[Setting up and Switching to Self-hosted Runner](../404bd5c70040/)".* After installing XCode and the basic environment on your local machine, register and activate the Runner, then change `runs-on` to `[self-hosted]` in the Action Workflow YAML.***

The issue of multiple Runners on the same machine has mostly been resolved in the Actions above, such as changing all shared dependency directories to local directories. Another problem encountered during testing that needs to be addressed is the simulator conflict: "**When two test Jobs are run by two Runners on the same machine simultaneously, specifying the same simulator causes interference and test failures.**"

The solution is simple: assign a separate simulator to each individual Runner.

#### Multiple Runners Configured for Simulators on the Same Machine

Assuming I have **two Runners on the same machine** receiving tasks in parallel:

- `ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-A`

- `ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-B`

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*3ptg9Tl5fBbEIYB4kgh0kw.png)

In XCode Simulator settings, we need to add two simulators:

- Device Model, iOS Version, and Test Environment

**Change the test step in CI-Testing.yml to:**

```bash
# Run Fastlane Unit Test Lane
      - name: Run Tests
        id: testing
        # Set working directory so subsequent commands don't need to cd ./Product/
        working-directory: ./Product/
        env:
          # ...
          # Repo -> Settings -> Actions secrets and variables -> variables
          # iOS version of the simulator
          SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION: ${{ vars.SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION }}

          # Current Runner name
          RUNNER_NAME: ${{ runner.name }}
          
          # ...
        run: \\|

          # ...
          bundle exec fastlane ${TEST_LANE} device:"${RUNNER_NAME} (${SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION})" \\| tee "$RUNNER_TEMP/testing_output.txt"
          # ...
```

- `device` **changed to** `${RUNNER_NAME} (${SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION})`

- `SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION` is still consistently set via the Repo variables.

**The combined result will be (using 18.4 as an example):**

- Runner: `ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-A`  
  Simulator: **ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-A(18.4)**

- Runner: `ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-B`
  Simulator: **ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-B(18.4)**

This way, when two Runners run tests simultaneously, two simulators will start and run independently.

### Additional SSH Agent Setup — For Fastlane Match or Private CocoaPods Repo

When using Fastlane Match or a Private CocoaPods Repo, since they reside in another Private Repo, the current Repo/Action environment cannot directly git clone. You need to set up the ssh agent so that the Action has permission to operate during execution.

#### Step 1. Generate SSH Key

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*kPWl9hombBgQ15i-n2sY2A.png)

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "zhgchgli@gmail.com"
```

`Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/zhgchgli/.ssh/id_ed25519):` /Users/zhgchgli/Downloads/zhgchgli

- Input the download path to make it easier for us to copy the content

`Enter passphrase for “/Users/zhgchgli/Downloads/zhgchgli” (empty for no passphrase):`

- **Leave Blank:** For CI/CD use, passphrase cannot be entered interactively in the CLI, **so please leave it blank**

- Generation completed ( .pub/private_key)

#### Step 2. Set Deploy Key in Private Repo

github-actions-ci-cd-demo-certificates Repo

Settings → Security → Deploy keys → Add deploy key。

- Title: Enter Key Name

- Key: `Paste the .pub Key content`

Completed.

#### Step 3. Set SSH Private Key to Secrets in the Action's Repo

![github-actions-ci-cd-demo Repo](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*Jm92pQHMOImQzZtmmvd1ng.jpeg)

github-actions-ci-cd-demo Repo

Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret.

- Name: Enter the secret variable name `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`

- Secret: `Paste the private_key content`

Completed.

#### Step 4. SSH Agent setup complete, now verify Git Clone Private Repo access rights

[**Demo-Git-Clone-Private-Repo.yml**](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/actions/workflows/Demo-Git-Clone-Private-Repo.yml){:target="_blank"} **:**

```yaml
name: Demo Git Clone Private Repo

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  clone-private-repo:
    name: Git Clone Private Repo
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30

    steps:
      # 🔐 Enable SSH Agent and add private key
      - name: Setup SSH Agent
        uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.9.0
        with:
          ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}

      # 🛡️ Add github.com to known_hosts to avoid host verification errors
      - name: Add GitHub to known_hosts
        run: \\|
          mkdir -p ~/.ssh
          ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
      # 📦 Use SSH to clone private repo and verify
      - name: Clone and Verify Private Repo
        run: \\|
          git clone git@github.com:ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo-certificates.git ./fakeMatch/
          if [ -d "./fakeMatch/.git" ]; then
            echo "✅ Repo cloned successfully into ./fakeMatch/"
            cd ./fakeMatch
            echo "📌 Current commit: $(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
          else
            echo "❌ Clone failed. SSH Agent may not be configured properly."
            exit 1
          fi
```

You can use the above Action to verify if the setup is successful.

Success. Subsequent `fastlane match` or `pod install` for private pods should execute correctly.
