#### Preface

In mid-2025, a series of articles was written on building a complete App CI/CD process from scratch using GitHub Actions:

- [CI/CD Practical Guide (Part 1): What is CI/CD? How to Build a Stable and Efficient Development Team with CI/CD? Tool Selection?](../c008a9e8ceca/)

- [CI/CD Practical Guide (Part 2): Complete Guide to Using and Building GitHub Actions with Self-hosted Runner](../404bd5c70040/)

- [CI/CD Practical Guide (3): Implementing CI and CD Workflows for App Projects with GitHub Actions](../4b001d2e8440/)

- [CI/CD Practical Guide (Part 4): Using Google Apps Script Web App to Connect GitHub Actions for Building a Free and Easy Packaging Tool Platform](../4273e57e7148/)

Recently, I ran through the process again in a new environment and learned new things each time. This time, I focused on using Fastlane Match to manage development and distribution certificates.

### [What are Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles, and Devices?](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list){:target="_blank"}

In the Apple ecosystem, app development is based on certificate and provisioning profile management. Unlike Android, where an .apk file can be installed and used freely, Apple enforces strict certificate matching rules. If these rules are not met, the app cannot be installed or used.

#### **Main Components and Their Functions:**

![](/assets/823ac523ccc8/1*PyM0l-jXXcVBKubOwCiTsw.png)

#### **Certificates: Who Issues Them**

- **Development** — Used on physical devices during development (no certificates needed for simulators), associated with a person or API Key (with quantity limits).

- **Distribution** — Packaging for AppStore, Testflight, or Ad Hoc internal testing (limited to registered devices), with quantity limits, belongs to the Team.

- **Enterprise** — For internal use within the company.

> ***Format*** *: Requires both `Private Key` and `Certificate .cer` to use, or exporting as a `.p12` file will include both.*

#### **Identifiers: Which App/Extension (Bundle Id)**

App Bundle Id registration and the required Capabilities (such as enabling Push Notifications, App Groups…) and App Services.

Extensions also have their own Identifiers.

#### **Devices: Registered Devices (iPhone/iPad, etc.)**

Development running on physical devices and Distribution Ad Hoc internal testing can only be used on registered devices.

> ***Limit: 100; including revocations, the quota resets only at the start of each annual billing cycle.***

#### **Provisioning Profile (hereafter referred to as Profile): Description File**

Combination of Certificates + Identifiers + Devices Relationships.

- **Development** — Provisioning profiles used during the development phase. Required for testing on physical devices. The profile contains the relationship between Certificates, Identifiers, and Devices.

- **Ad Hoc** — A provisioning profile for internal testing (e.g., Deploy to Firebase App Distribution), containing the relationship between Certificates, Identifiers, and Devices.

- **App Store** — Provisioning profiles used for packaging and uploading to the App Store / Testflight. The profiles include the relationship between Certificates and Identifiers.

> *Format: `.mobileprovision`*

> ***Note: A Profile is just a description file that defines relationships; it does not contain the actual certificate.***

### Common Issues in Daily Use

#### Development Certificate

![](/assets/823ac523ccc8/1*W8bgbVPEBOQZyHBEKZHmAw.png)

- Before adopting Match for unified certificate management, each developer creates their own `Development Certificate` and `Development Profile`; assuming there are over 1,000 developers in the organization, the [Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles, Devices](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list){:target="_blank"} backend would become extremely chaotic and unmanageable.

- If you have an outsourced team responsible only for development, you still need to add them to the Apple Developer Program backend so they can generate their own development certificates and profiles.

#### Distribution Certificate

![](/assets/823ac523ccc8/1*z00mYi900fkZV-EmHXMCeg.png)

- Distribution Certificates are created by the Team, so each developer program Team can only create a limited number of distribution certificates.

- A common practice is for one engineer to create the Distribution Certificate and then export the .p12 file to other developers who need to publish the app or to use it on the CI/CD machines.

- When the team is large and there are many apps, sending files back and forth becomes very troublesome, and **they need to be renewed every year**.

- **When packaging Ad Hoc, if a new device is registered, everyone and the CI/CD must re-download the profile for the new device to take effect.**

### [Fastlane Match](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/match/){:target="_blank"}

To address the above issues, we want a platform to manage everything related to certificates on our behalf. All developers and CI/CD services pull and update data uniformly from this platform. The storage of this platform must be secure. This is — [Fastlane Match](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/match/){:target="_blank"}.

> *Easily sync your certificates and profiles across your team*

> *A new approach to iOS and macOS code signing: Share one code signing identity across your development team to simplify your code signing setup and prevent code signing issues.*

> *match is the implementation of the [codesigning.guide concept](https://codesigning.guide/){:target="_blank"}. match creates all required certificates & provisioning profiles and stores them in a separate git repository, Google Cloud, or Amazon S3. Every team member with access to the selected storage can use those credentials for code signing. match also automatically repairs broken and expired credentials. It’s the easiest way to share signing credentials across teams*

![](/assets/823ac523ccc8/1*UEL7Abx3PFrYbAc2yVlq8A.png)

- Both developers and CI/CD services use the Fastlane Match command to manage certificates.

- Fastlane Match helps you interact with App Store Connect to manage certificates, and finally **encrypts** and uploads the results to the specified storage (Git in this case).  
  If you want to separate permissions, you can use two repos: one for managing Development certificates and one for managing Distribution certificates.

- **Only those responsible for management can create and push certificates; others and the CI/CD only perform read and pull operations on the certificates.**

### Fastlane Match Setup and Usage

Taking Git Storage as an example, all certificates.

**1. Create an Empty Git Private Match Repo for Storing Certificates**  
Although all Certificates and Profiles are stored encrypted, you still need to properly set the access permissions for the repo.

2. Confirm that Git SSH access is set up locally by using `git clone git@github.com:xxx/certificates.git`

> *It is recommended to **consistently use SSH Git Clone Repo**, since CI/CD will use the same method.*

> *If running fastlane match gets stuck at `If cloning the repo takes too long, you can use the `clone_branch_directly` option in match.`, it is most likely an SSH permission issue.*

3. Run `bundle exec fastlane match init` in the project directory to complete the setup

```lua
[21:54:32]: fastlane match supports multiple storage modes, please select the one you want to use:
1. git
2. google_cloud
3. s3
4. gitlab_secure_files
# Enter 1 to use git
?   1

[22:04:40]: Please create a new, private git repository to store the certificates and profiles there
[22:04:40]: URL of the Git Repo: git@github.com:xxx/certificates.git
# Enter the SSH URL of your created Git Private Match Repo

[22:04:47]: Successfully created './fastlane/Matchfile'. You can open the file using a code editor.
[22:04:47]: You can now run `fastlane match development`, `fastlane match adhoc`, `fastlane match enterprise` and `fastlane match appstore`
[22:04:47]: On the first run for each environment it will create the provisioning profiles and
[22:04:47]: certificates for you. From then on, it will automatically import the existing profiles.
[22:04:47]: For more information visit https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/match/
```

4. After completion, a **`fastlane/Matchfile` :** will be generated

```bash
# Your Git Private Match Repo SSH URL
git_url("git@github.com:xxxx/certificates.git")

storage_mode("git")

type("development") # The default type, can be: appstore, adhoc, enterprise or development

# app_identifier(["tools.fastlane.app", "tools.fastlane.app2"])
# username("user@fastlane.tools") # Your Apple Developer Portal username

# For all available options run `fastlane match --help`
# Remove the # at the beginning of the line to enable the other options

# The docs are available on https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/match
```

**5. Generate [App Store Connect API .p8 Key](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/creating-api-keys-for-app-store-connect-api){:target="_blank"}**, **and use the API Key to generate certificates uniformly:**

![](/assets/823ac523ccc8/1*RFhS_XtZ3TfIJBAeoE-laA.png)

> *⚠️️️️ [**App Store Connect API .p8 Key**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/creating-api-keys-for-app-store-connect-api){:target="_blank"} **has extensive permissions**, allowing not only certificate management but also app submission, review handling, backend user management, reviews, and financial reports.*

> *Whether to include it in the team's .git for everyone to access can be decided based on the team's situation.*

> ***A higher security approach is to allow only the managers to handle it and store it encrypted for use in CI/CD (introduced later in the article).***

> ***For demo convenience, this is placed directly under the fastlane directory for access.***

> ***Additionally, the Fastlane script in this article is simplified for demonstration purposes and does not consider code repetition or structure.***

#### Certificate Management

```bash
platform :ios do
  lane :match_development do \\|options\\|
    # Replace with your App Identifier ID
    app_identifier = "li.zhgchg.myApp"

    type = options.fetch(:type, "development")
    isRead = options.fetch(:isRead, true)
    if isRead 
      readonly = true
      force = false
    else
      readonly = false
      force = true

      # App Store Connect API Key is required to manage certificates on Apple's backend
      # Assume the App Store Connect API .p8 Key is in the ./fastlane/ directory
      app_store_connect_api_key(
        key_id: "XXXXXX",
        issuer_id: "XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX",
        key_filepath: "./fastlane/AuthKey_XXXXXX.p8",
      )
    end

    # Fetch Development certificates for app_identifier
    match(
      type: type,
      app_identifier: app_identifier, 
      readonly: readonly, # Whether to update/upload cert/profile when needed
      force: force # Whether to forcibly recreate the provisioning profile
    )
  end
end
```

**Create Development Certificate & Profile and Upload to Match Repo:**

```
bundle exec fastlane match_development type:development isRead:false
```

- No errors mean that the Development Certificate & Profile were successfully created, installed, and pushed to the Match Repo.

**The first time you set up, you will need to configure a `Passphrase`:**

```markdown
[23:29:12]: Enter the passphrase that should be used to encrypt/decrypt your certificates
[23:29:12]: This passphrase is specific per repository and will be stored in your local keychain
[23:29:12]: Make sure to remember the password, as you'll need it when you run match on a different machine
[23:29:12]: Passphrase for Match storage:
```

- This value is used as the salt to encrypt all files in your Match Repo.

- It is recommended to generate a [random string](https://www.random.org/strings/?num=1&len=32&digits=on&upperalpha=on&loweralpha=on&unique=on&format=html&rnd=new){:target="_blank"}, then set and record it.

- In future updates or when others pull the Match Repo, this string is required to decrypt back to the original files.

**Other team members uniformly pull Development Certificate & Profile from Match Repo:**

```bash
bundle exec fastlane match_development type:development
```

**The first time you use it, you will be asked for your login password (login keychain) because the certificate needs to be installed into the keychain. Enter it twice to confirm:**

```markdown
[16:52:59]: Installing certificate...
[16:53:00]: No local code signing identities found.
You can run security find-identity -v -p codesigning to get this output.
This Stack Overflow thread has more information: https://stackoverflow.com/q/35390072/774.
(Check in Keychain Access for an expired WWDR certificate: https://stackoverflow.com/a/35409835/774 has more info.)
[16:53:00]: Enter the password for /Users/zhgchgli/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db
[16:53:00]: This passphrase will be stored in your local keychain under the name fastlane_keychain_login and used in future runs
[16:53:00]: This prompt can be avoided by specifying the 'keychain_password' option or 'MATCH_KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD' environment variable
[16:53:00]: Password for login keychain: ********
[16:53:24]: Type password for login keychain again: ********
```

**If you see `Could not create another Development certificate, reached the maximum number of available Development certificates.` :**

The maximum number of Development Certificates (2) has been reached. Please delete unused ones in the dashboard first.

> ***Here I also hit another pitfall: I carelessly placed the project under the iCloud directory, and for some reason, certificate issues kept occurring (suspected keychain access problems).***

**If Match Development finishes fetching certificates but keeps showing errors or invalid:**

> *Most likely, you still have leftover or multiple certificates, causing Xcode to get confused.*

1. Close XCode

2. Open MacOS keychain: `open /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Keychain\ Access.app`

3. login keychain -> All items -> Search `apple development` -> Delete all certificates

4. Finder -> Go -> Go to -> `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/Provisioning Profiles/` -> Delete all Profiles

5. Run `bundle exec fastlane match_development` again to fetch the certificates

6. Restarting Xcode should fix the issue.

—

**Create AdHoc Distribution Certificate & Profile and Upload to Match Repo:**

```bash
bundle exec fastlane match_development type:adhoc isRead:false
```

**Create AppStore Distribution Certificate & Profile and Upload to Match Repo:**

```bash
bundle exec fastlane match_development type:appstore isRead:false
```

**CI/CD services uniformly pull the Distribution Certificate & Profile from the Match Repo (`isRead:true`), then proceed to execute the build and release tasks.**

#### Register a New Device

```php
platform :ios do  
  desc "Register a new device and refresh profiles"
  lane :registerDevice do \\|options\\|
    # Replace with your App Identifier ID
    app_identifier = "li.zhgchg.myApp"

    # App Store Connect API Key is required to manage certificates in Apple backend
    # Assume the App Store Connect API .p8 Key is in the ./fastlane/ directory
    app_store_connect_api_key(
      key_id: "XXXXXX",
      issuer_id: "XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX",
      key_filepath: "./fastlane/AuthKey_XXXXXX.p8",
    )
    # Input: UDID and device name
    udid = options[:udid] \\|\\| UI.input("Enter device UDID:")
    device_name = options[:name] \\|\\| UI.input("Enter device name:")
    UI.message("📱 Registering device #{device_name} (#{udid})")
    register_device(
      name: device_name,
      udid: udid,
      platform: 'ios'
    )

    # Update Development certificates for app_identifier
    match(
      type: "development",
      app_identifier: app_identifier, 
      readonly: false, # Update and upload cert/profile if needed
      force_for_new_devices: true # Rebuild provisioning profile for new devices
    )

    # Update AdHoc certificates for app_identifier
    match(
      type: "adhoc",
      app_identifier: app_identifier, 
      readonly: false, # Update and upload cert/profile if needed
      force_for_new_devices: true # Rebuild provisioning profile for new devices
    )
  end
end
```

After registration, other developers or CI/CD services pulling the Profile (Development or AdHoc) from the Match Repo will include the new devices.

### Fastlane Match x CI/CD Workflow Integration

After a general introduction to how Fastlane Match generates and pulls Push/Pull certificates, the next step is to explain how to integrate it into the CI/CD process.

#### Question 1 — How to Clone Private Match Repo

The most common issue is how to clone the Private Match Repo project in CI/CD. On local development, we use ssh git clone with our own account's ssh key, so there is no problem. However, in CI/CD, this key is not available. Although you can use a personal key, it is not secure.

**GitHub — Repo Deploy Key:**

1. First, generate the private/public key locally: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ./id_rsa` ( **do NOT enter a passphrase** )

2. Go to **Match Private Repo** -> Settings -> Security -> Deploy keys -> Add deploy key:

![](/assets/823ac523ccc8/1*nzo-oPRi7DDxPvtJIWBspw.png)

3. Open `id_rsa.pub` with a text editor, copy the content, and paste it into Key -> "Add key"

![](/assets/823ac523ccc8/1*mbwtijzM-2iAzfgFiT32rw.png)

5. Back to the main Repo -> Settings -> Security -> Secrets and variables

![](/assets/823ac523ccc8/1*jvY8Yg6tI85LNKHgIaHVVQ.png)

5. Add SSH Private Key Content to Secret:

![](/assets/823ac523ccc8/1*8WiPfOz21rJWD6yiMwP3aw.png)

- Name: `MATCH_REPO_DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY`

6. Setting SSH Key in the main Repo's GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: CI - Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout current repo (Repo A)
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup SSH for Deploy Key
        run: \\|
          mkdir -p ~/.ssh
          echo "${{ secrets.MATCH_REPO_DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY }}" > ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
          chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
          ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

      - name: Test Clone
        run: \\|
          git clone git@github.com:xxxx/match-certificates.git
# Success!
# .. do deploy job...
```

7. Setup Successful!

#### Question 2 — Secure Storage and Use of App Store Connect API .p8 Key

Because GitHub Actions cannot store files directly, you must first save them as strings and then write them to files.

1. Add an `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_CONTENT` secret to the main repo following the same steps as in Question 1.

2. Open the `AuthKey_XXXXXX.p8` file with a text editor, then copy and paste its content.

3. **Add a step in the main repo's GitHub Actions to read the content and write it to a file:**

```yaml
name: CI - Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout current repo (Repo A)
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup SSH for Deploy Key
        run: \\|
          mkdir -p ~/.ssh
          echo "${{ secrets.MATCH_REPO_DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY }}" > ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
          chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
          ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts  
      
      - name: Write Secret Key to File
        env:
          APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_CONTENT: ${{ secrets.APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_CONTENT }}
        run: \\|
          # ensure fastlane directory exists
          mkdir -p ./fastlane
      
          # create file path
          APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH=./fastlane/AuthKey_XXXXXX.p8
      
          # write content to file (keep newline)
          echo "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_CONTENT" > "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH"
      
          # (optional) restrict permissions
          chmod 600 "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH"

      - name: Deploy to Firebase
        env:
          MATCH_PASSWORD: "${{ secrets.MATCH_PASSWORD }}"
        run: bundle exec fastlane deploy_to_firebase
```

#### Question 3 — Set Passphrase for Private Match Repo to Prevent Prompt Interruptions During Match

1. Add `MATCH_PASSWORD` to Secrets in the main Repo as in step 1 of the same issue.

2. Enter the Passphrase for your configured Fastlane Match Repo

3. **Add** `env: secret.MATCH_PASSWORD` **to the main repo's GitHub Actions:**

```yaml
name: CI - Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout current repo (Repo A)
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup SSH for Deploy Key
        run: \\|
          mkdir -p ~/.ssh
          echo "${{ secrets.MATCH_REPO_DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY }}" > ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
          chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
          ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts  
      
      - name: Write Secret Key to File
        env:
          APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_CONTENT: ${{ secrets.APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_CONTENT }}
        run: \\|
          # ensure fastlane directory exists
          mkdir -p ./fastlane
      
          # create file path
          APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH=./fastlane/AuthKey_XXXXXX.p8
      
          # write content to file (keep newline)
          echo "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_CONTENT" > "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH"
      
          # (optional) restrict permissions
          chmod 600 "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH"

      - name: Deploy to Firebase
        env:
          MATCH_PASSWORD: "${{ secrets.MATCH_PASSWORD }}"
        run: bundle exec fastlane deploy_to_firebase
```

#### Question 4 — Keychain Handling on Self-hosted Runner

Unlike cloud machines that are always clean and new each time, with Self-hosted Runners we can specify `derived_data_path`, `output_directory`, `buildlog_path`, and `reinstall_app` in Fastlane to ensure a clean environment for each run; but since Certificates and Profiles are installed in the system Keychain, how should we handle them?

Fastlane also considers this for us; you can create a clean Keychain before running Match:

```yaml
name: CI - Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout current repo (Repo A)
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup SSH for Deploy Key
        run: \\|
          mkdir -p ~/.ssh
          echo "${{ secrets.MATCH_REPO_DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY }}" > ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
          chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
          ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts  
      
      - name: Write Secret Key to File
        env:
          APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_CONTENT: ${{ secrets.APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_CONTENT }}
        run: \\|
          # ensure fastlane directory exists
          mkdir -p ./fastlane
      
          # create file path
          APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH=./fastlane/AuthKey_XXXXXX.p8
      
          # write content to file (keep newline)
          echo "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_CONTENT" > "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH"
      
          # (optional) restrict permissions
          chmod 600 "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH"

      - name: Create fastlane keychain
        env:
          KEYCHAIN_NAME: "${{ runner.name }}"
          MATCH_PASSWORD: "${{ secrets.MATCH_PASSWORD }}"
        run: \\|
          bundle exec fastlane run create_keychain \
            name:"$KEYCHAIN_NAME" \
            password:"$MATCH_PASSWORD" \
            unlock:true \
            timeout:0 \
            lock_when_sleeps:false
      
      - name: Deploy to Firebase
        env:
          MATCH_PASSWORD: "${{ secrets.MATCH_PASSWORD }}"
          KEYCHAIN_NAME: "${{ runner.name }}"
        run: bundle exec fastlane deploy_to_firebase

      # 🔥 This step always runs regardless of success or failure above
      - name: Delete fastlane keychain
        if: always()
        env:
          KEYCHAIN_NAME: ${{ runner.name }}
        run: \\|
          bundle exec fastlane run delete_keychain \
            name:"$KEYCHAIN_NAME"
```

- Each Runner only executes one job at a time, so we use the Runner Name as the Keychain Name. Each Runner will have its own Keychain.

- It will be deleted regardless of success or failure after execution.

- I didn't set a separate `keychain_password`; I just used `MATCH_PASSWORD` uniformly.

Add keychain parameters to the match method in `Fastlane/Fastfile`:

```ruby
#...
    match(
      type: "adhoc",
      app_identifier: app_identifier, 
      readonly: false, # Update and upload cert/profile if needed
      force_for_new_devices: true # Recreate provisioning profile for new devices
      keychain_name: ENV['KEYCHAIN_NAME'], # default value: nil
      keychain_password: ENV['MATCH_PASSWORD'] # default value: nil
    )
#...
```

This way, when Match fetches certificates, it will save them to the specified Keychain instead of the shared login keychain.

### Conclusion

The scope of Fastlane is too broad, so here I will only document the process of using Fastlane Match. Other lanes for testing, packaging, and releasing with Fastlane may be covered in a future supplementary article. If I think of any other Match-related issues or cases, I will add them later! Feel free to leave questions or comments!
