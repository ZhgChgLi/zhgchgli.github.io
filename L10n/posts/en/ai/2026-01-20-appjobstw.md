- **Step 2: Prioritize High Salary or 🆕**: First, open job listings marked with high salary or 🆕 to ensure you apply early.

- **Step 3: Apply Using Templates**: Prepare three resume templates for iOS, Android, and Flutter, and adjust technical keywords according to the job requirements.

- **Step 4: Record and Track**: Write down the company, job title, salary, application date, and response status in your Notion or spreadsheet.
