### Comprehensive Guide to Applying and Using the Citizen Digital Certificate: Fees, PIN, Card Reader, Mobile NFC, Mobile Citizen Digital Certificate, and Applications Explained

You might need it for online tax filing, applying for government documents, checking labor and health insurance information, or in situations like when I was preparing the LINE Bank tutorial: **to increase transfer limits/set up a designated account, the bank requires online verification using the Natural Person Certificate.**  
Whether you are "hearing about the Natural Person Certificate for the first time" or "have the card but don't know how to use it," this article breaks down the entire process in detail: **application, essential steps after card collection, how to use it on computer/phone, what the mobile Natural Person Certificate is, where it can be used, and how to troubleshoot common issues.**

## 1. What is a Citizen Digital Certificate? Explain Clearly in One Sentence

**Citizen Digital Certificate** is a card with an IC chip (or its "mobile version") that can do two things online:

1. **Identity Verification**: Proves "you are who you are" for login, inquiry, or application purposes

2. **Digital Signature**: Signing documents online (often considered equivalent to a personal signature or seal in many processes)

The image below separates "How to Use" and "What It Can Do," making it easier to understand why sometimes a card reader is needed and other times a phone will suffice:

***

## 2. Citizen Digital Certificate vs Mobile Citizen Digital Certificate: What’s the Difference?

There are two common types you often see:

### 1) Citizen Digital Certificate IC Card (Physical Card)

- You will receive a physical card.

- Common Usage Methods:

  - Computer + Card Reader

  - Mobile NFC (requires "website/APP support" + "your card version support")

![Citizen Digital Certificate Physical Card (示意, please mask personal info when sharing tutorials)](/assets/ai/cdc/1*zrmIss8K7vrn18f_CGffDg.png)

### 2) Mobile Citizen Digital Certificate (App Version)

- It is not "using the phone to scan the physical card"; instead, **the certificate is bound within the mobile App**, and verification is completed using biometric authentication/mobile security features.

- Advantages: No need to carry a card reader, no need to insert a card

- Restrictions:

  - Mobile devices that support biometric authentication

  - Usually, "one certificate can only be bound to one device."

  - Key renewal/extension will be required periodically (according to official regulations)

***

## 3. Before Applying: Eligibility, Fees, and What to Bring

This part is very important because if you forget even one item, your trip will be in vain.

### Eligibility for Application (Common Conditions)

- **At least 18 years old**

- **Registered Household**

- **In-person application** (must bring original ID card)

### Fees (According to Official Announcements)

- **Citizen Digital Certificate IC Card: Processing Fee 250 TWD**

- **Mobile Citizen Digital Certificate: Mobile Device Binding Fee 30 TWD**

- **Card Reader: Purchase on Your Own**

> [Reference: MOICA Certificate Operation Fees](https://moica.nat.gov.tw/expense.html){:target="_blank"}

### What Do You Need to Prepare?

I suggest you follow this **most reliable checklist:**

1. **Original National ID Card**

2. **Processing Fee (Cash)**

3. **Email + Mobile Number** (mainly used for receiving notifications)

***

## 4. Natural Person Certificate Application Process: Online Form → In-Person at Household Registration Office → Card Collection

One sentence: **Online is only for "filling out information" first; you must go to the household registration office in person at the end.**

![Natural Person Certificate Application Flowchart](/assets/ai/cdc/natural-person-certificate-apply-flow.svg)

### Step 1: Fill in the Application Online (RAC)

[The official portal is usually at MOICA:](https://moica.nat.gov.tw/rac_form.html){:target="_blank"}

You will see a form containing fields for Name, ID Number, Email, Mobile Phone, PIN Code (Card Password), and User Code:

![Natural Person Certificate Application Form (Screenshot)](/assets/ai/cdc/1*4xi8pHeUNAPZKijWiXfj1Q.png)

**Two Key Reminders for Online Form Filling:**

- **Online application data is usually kept for only 7 days**: After filling it out, don’t leave it pending—make sure to visit the household registration office in time.

- The "User Code" you fill in the form usually needs to be properly kept by yourself (explained later why).

### Step 2: Go to Any Household Registration Office for In-Person Processing

The key point is "any household registration office": usually, you don't need to return to your registered domicile.  
The on-site process is roughly: identity verification → payment → set/confirm password → card collection.

### Step 3: After receiving the card, first complete "Activation and Security Settings"

Do not rush to log in to the website right after receiving the card. First, finish reading the next chapter (PIN / User Code / Security).

## 5. What Exactly Are the PIN Code/User Code? (Reading This Can Help You Avoid 80% of Common Mistakes)

The most common issue when using the Citizen Digital Certificate is not "how to apply," but:

- Forgot PIN

- Card Locked Due to Incorrect PIN Entry

- Not sure what the user code is for

### 1) PIN Code (Card Password)

You can think of it as: **the unlock password you enter every time you want to "use the card."**  
Many processes require entering the PIN to complete verification or signing.

Common Explanation on the MOICA Form: The PIN may have a default rule (e.g., the last 4 digits of the ID number + birth month and day MMDD), and it is recommended to change the password on the dedicated website after completion.  
This also means: **The default PIN can be guessed, so be sure to change it.**

### 2) User Code

User codes are usually used for management operations such as "unlocking/deactivating (reactivating)" (according to official rules).  
The official frequent reminder: **User codes are not registered in the system**, so you must keep them safe yourself.

### 3) Security Management Checklist (Follow Exactly)

## 6. How to Use the Citizen Digital Certificate on a Computer? (General Concepts for Windows/macOS)

Just remember one formula:  
**Citizen Digital Certificate IC Card + Card Reader + Computer (with internet) + Required components/drivers for the service = Usable**

### 1) How to Choose a Card Reader?

Generally, a USB card reader that supports "Smart Card" is sufficient.  
If you only need it for tax filing or occasional use, a common model will do; for long-term office use, choose one with better quality and compatibility.

### 2) What Software Should Be Installed?

Different websites require different components (such as cross-platform web components/drivers/card management tools).  
The safest approach is: **follow the download page of the specific website you want to use and install accordingly**.

[You can find the "Cross-Platform Web Component Download" entry on MOICA:](https://moica.nat.gov.tw/rac_plugin.html){:target="_blank"}

> Reminder: Some components may require browser permissions or restarting the browser/computer. Following the steps usually resolves the issue.

### 3) Standard Procedure for Use (Almost All Websites Are Similar)

1. Insert the Citizen Digital Certificate into the card reader

2. Open the website and select "Citizen Digital Certificate" to log in/sign.

3. Enter the PIN as prompted

4. After completing login/signature, **remove the card**

### 4) Common Troubleshooting (Computer)

- **Website cannot read the card**: Try changing the USB port, reconnecting the card reader, swapping the cable, or testing on a different computer.

- **Component Not Installed Error Repeatedly**: Check if the browser/component versions match (especially after macOS updates).

- **PIN Always Incorrect**: Stop immediately! Do not keep trying to avoid locking the card; first confirm if the PIN was changed by you.

## 7. How to Use Mobile NFC to Verify the Citizen Digital Certificate? (A Common Pain Point for Many)

If your goal is "online verification for banks/apps," you will likely encounter NFC mode.  
For example, when I was preparing the LINE Bank tutorial, I encountered the requirement that "designated accounts need natural person certificate verification."

![Identity Verification Completed (Illustration)](/assets/ai/cdc/1*nLPxsTJ1ALuv4hLZPcdqmw.jpeg)

### 1) First Clarify: You Need to Meet "Three Conditions" Simultaneously

1. **Your phone supports NFC**

2. **Server-side (APP/Website) Support for Reading the Citizen Digital Certificate via NFC**

3. **Your Citizen Digital Certificate Card Supports NFC**  
   For example, based on your experience: some services limit NFC use to cards with certain starting numbers (e.g., TP07).

### 2) iPhone / Android Sensing Tips (Very Useful)

I completely agree with your original comment: the NFC range of the Citizen Digital Certificate is sometimes very small and requires precise alignment.

- **iPhone**: First, place the card near the upper back of the phone or near the camera, then slowly move to find the sensing point.

- **Android**: Usually located at the upper middle or center on the back, depending on the brand.

- **Common Tips**: Keep the card flat, move it slowly left/right or up/down, and avoid quickly removing it.

## 8. Mobile Citizen Digital Certificate: When Should You Switch to It?

If you meet any of the following conditions, the Mobile Citizen Digital Certificate may be more suitable for you:

- You don't have a card reader and don't want to buy one

- You often need to complete government or financial verifications on your mobile phone

- You want to minimize the hassle of "inserting the card + installing components."

According to the MOICA form FAQ, the mobile natural person certificate usually has these features (based on official announcements):

- A mobile device with internet access and biometric recognition is required

- A user can usually bind only one set of certificates per device.

- You may need to regularly update or renew the key (for example, you can renew it for one year 60 days before expiration).

- There is a security usage period (e.g., up to 8 years, after which you must reapply in person).

## 9. Where Can the Citizen Digital Certificate Be Used? (Listing All Possible Uses)

The core value of the Citizen Digital Certificate is "trusted identity verification/signature," so its applications are very broad. Below is an organization by "category" to help you quickly reference when needed.

### 1) Government/Public Services (Most Common)

- **Online Tax Filing** (Login/Declaration/Inquiry)

- **MyData Platform** [Online Personal Data Access and Authorized Data Exchange](https://mydata.nat.gov.tw){:target="_blank"}

- **Household Registration/Land Administration Related Applications** (Depending on each city/county and system support)

- **Various Government Portal Logins** (According to website announcements)

### 2) Finance/Banking/Securities (Common Reason: Risk Management)

- **Increase Transfer Limit**

- **Set Up Designated Account (Whitelist)**

- **Online Signing of Consent Forms/Contracts**

Use the LINE Bank operation screenshots you provided to create a "Practical Case": The same Citizen Digital Certificate is commonly used in financial scenarios to "change high-risk operations to strong personal authentication."

#### Case: LINE Bank "Add Remittance Designated Account" Requires Natural Person Certificate Verification

![LINE Bank: Remittance Designated Account Entry (Screenshot)](/assets/ai/cdc/1*Mi9tRTDMpubsVfWF6AXidg.png)

For first-time use, you usually start with "Citizen Digital Certificate Verification + Video Verification." After completing this, you can add a designated account:

![Add Designated Account (Screenshot)](/assets/ai/cdc/1*RvHTvjTzjap4M09RG5Q8xQ.png)

After completing the SMS verification, you will see the addition successful message:

![SMS Verification (Screenshot)](/assets/ai/cdc/1*2VbwWyl9zQCY9p2fVVoL2w.png)

![Add Success (Screenshot)](/assets/ai/cdc/1*WmXzGCmOWMkOxwMhYJ-mfQ.png)

Next time you make a transfer, you can choose "Transfer via Designated Account," making the process faster and more secure:

![Transfer to Designated Account (Screenshot)](/assets/ai/cdc/1*TfcH3RFr1wR7XKjKjqnvJQ.png)

### 3) Medical/Insurance/Personal Data Inquiry

These services often offer multiple login options (such as Citizen Digital Certificate, Health Insurance Card, mobile verification, etc.). The differences you usually encounter are:

- Depth of Available Information

- Scope of Application Authority

- Is a digital signature required?

***

## 10. Frequently Asked Questions (The Most Common Issues You Encounter with the Citizen Digital Certificate)

### Q1: Is a card reader always required for the Citizen Digital Certificate?

Not necessarily. It depends on which method the service you use supports:

- Computer Card Reader (Most Common)

- Mobile NFC (requires server support)

- Mobile Citizen Digital Certificate (App)

### Q2: What should I do if I forget my PIN?

Do not attempt randomly to avoid locking the card. According to official rules, most cases have an "unlock/reset" process (possibly via user code or in-person). It is recommended to handle it directly through MOICA's official channels.

### Q3: What should I do if I forget my user code?

The official common reminder is that "the user code is not recorded by the system," so losing it usually leads to more complicated procedures (possibly requiring in-person service). This is why I always emphasize keeping it offline.

### Q4: Mobile NFC Sensing Keeps Failing?

Based on your experience, start by adjusting the "position/angle/duration":

- For iPhone, start near the camera and slowly move left and right.

- Place the card flat and do not swipe it quickly.

- The server may sometimes require "Do not move the card until the process is complete" after sensing.

### Q5: How long is the validity period of the Citizen Digital Certificate?

According to MOICA form FAQs, the typical validity period for a physical Citizen Digital Certificate is **5 years** (please refer to the card surface or official announcements for confirmation).

### Q6: Can I lend my Citizen Digital Certificate to others?

Not recommended and very dangerous. The Citizen Digital Certificate has identity authentication and digital signature capabilities, so lending it is equivalent to handing over your "online ID card + seal."

### Q7: What should I do if my Citizen Digital Certificate is lost?

Principle: **Deactivate (suspend/revoke) the certificate first, then proceed with reissuance**. This prevents misuse by anyone who might find it.
