# [Medium To Jekyll Starter](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/medium-to-jekyll-starter.github.io) (based on Chirpy Starter and ZMediumToMarkdown)

This project enables you to effortlessly and quickly create a mirrored content site for your Medium blog.

Automatically syncs your Medium posts, retrieves all content (including images and embedded code snippets), converts them to Markdown, and serves them as a static website using Jekyll with the Chirpy theme on GitHub Pages.

It’s user-friendly, stable, completely free, and requires a one-time setup for lifetime service.
