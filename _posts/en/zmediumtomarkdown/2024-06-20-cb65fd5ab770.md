### \[Travel Journal\] 2024 Second Visit to Kyushu 9-Day Free Trip, Entering Japan via Busan → Hakata Cruise

Entering Japan's Hakata from Busan, South Korea via the Shin San Camellia cruise, traveling through Yufuin, Oita, Fukuoka, Shimonoseki, Shido, and Sasebo; a total of 11 days

#### Background

Taking advantage of a brief period between finishing a phase of work and starting a new job, I decided to travel to Japan for a while; I resigned on 5/30, departed on 6/3, returned on 6/13, and started my new job on 6/24. The timing was just right, as I could take a longer trip (a total of 11 days) during this transition. This time, I traveled solo but teamed up with [James Lin](https://medium.com/u/cbe4c8255367){:target="_blank"} (Ex-Binance Android Developer, feel free to refer job opportunities to him), who I traveled with to [Tokyo](../9da2c51fa4f2/) last year. This is my second visit to Kyushu; I visited Fukuoka, Kumamoto, and Nagasaki during my [first trip in September last year](../d78e0b15a08a/), and this time I aimed to cover places I missed last time. Therefore, my itinerary will differ from James's, and we will act separately.

**The following are the places I visited last time that I may not revisit this time. For those interested in learning more about Kyushu, please refer to my previous travel journal "[2023 Kyushu 10-Day Solo Trip](../d78e0b15a08a/)":**
- Fukuoka: Mojiko, Kokura Castle, Kushida Shrine, Sumiyoshi Shrine, Nakasu Yatai, Fukuoka Tower, PayPay Dome, shopping in Tenjin, Canal City Hakata, Lalaport, Yanagawa River Cruise, Dazaifu
- Nagasaki: Chinatown, Glover Garden, Inasa Mountain Night View, Atomic Bomb Museum, Peace Park
- Kumamoto: Kumamoto Castle, Aso Nakadake, Aso Shrine, Suizenji Jojuen, Tsuruya Department Store, Kamitori Shopping Street, Shimotori Shopping Street, Kato Shrine, Sakura-machi Shopping Center, Kumamon Square (Department Head's Office)



> For more information, please refer to "[**2023 Kyushu 10-Day Solo Trip**](../d78e0b15a08a/)". 




#### Lessons Learned from This Trip

As usual, I summarize the lessons learned from this trip at the beginning: "Traveling freely means continuously paying tuition (spending time or money) to learn; the more experiences you have, the fewer pitfalls you will encounter."
- **At JR stations without any electronic boards, check the platform bulletin board for the timetable to confirm which platform the train will stop at.** ⚠️
- **At some JR stations without station masters, you need to get off at the first car (the conductor also serves as the station master, similar to getting off a bus).**
- JR limited express and regular tickets are separate; after purchasing a regular ticket, you need to buy an additional limited express ticket to ride the limited express; riding without a ticket will require you to pay a penalty. (With a JR Pass, you don't need to worry; you can ride without thinking.)
- JR limited express trains almost always have ticket checks; if you are in a non-reserved seat, the conductor will ask where you are going for record-keeping.
- **If you have an online reservation for the JR Pass (which requires credit card payment for the reservation fee), you will need to show the same credit card when exchanging for the JR Pass, so make sure to bring that card to Japan.** ⚠️
- If you book the Shin San Camellia too late, you will only get an economy shared room (8–11 people of mixed genders, only a Japanese-style public bath, lights out at 11 PM).
- If you book Yufuin no Mori too late, there will be no seats available, and you can only take the regular Yufuin JR train.
- Early reservations are required for kayaking in Takachiho Gorge.
- There are two Shinkansen trains that cannot be taken with a JR Pass: **"Nozomi" and "Mizuho," which require separate tickets.**
- Sometimes the ticket gates for the Shinkansen entering and exiting Hakata Station may get stuck, and you need to go through the manual gate (because the aforementioned two trains cannot be taken; as long as you confirm you are not taking those two trains, the station staff will let you through).
- **Always double-check your reservations; I encountered an issue with the gender being incorrect when booking the Shin San Camellia, and I quickly contacted customer service for assistance in correcting it.** ⚠️
**(Later I found out that it probably didn't matter since it was a mixed-gender room, but it still startled me.)**
- Buses in Kyushu may not be on time, and Google Maps directions may not always be accurate.
- [Japan Luggage Delivery Coin Lockers Inquiry and Reservation](https://cloak.ecbo.io/zh-TW){:target="_blank"} ( **but not all, many places that offer luggage delivery are not listed above** )
- You need a power adapter for Korea.
- Korean won can only be exchanged at the counter.
- In Korea, you can just buy a Tmoney transportation card without needing a Wowpass.

> **_This time in Kyushu, using the JR Pass, take the limited express if possible. Except for Yufuin, which has reserved seating, the rest are directly in the non-reserved cars (not crowded, with seats available)._** 





For `Yufuin no Mori`, I couldn't reserve a seat from Hakata to Yufuin, so I could only reserve a seat on `Yufuin 1`.

Please note that `Yufuin no Mori` is different from `regular trains (Yufuin X)`, so be careful to ensure you are reserving `Yufuin no Mori` when making a reservation.

**Reservation Method:**


> _You must purchase the JR Pass first to make a reservation, as the only travel agency option for reservations is KLOOK. I was worried that other agencies might not be able to book **(the page states that customers with MCO issued by agencies other than those mentioned should not make any selection. It should be possible too)**, so I bought the JR Pass from KLOOK._

**In Korea, to use [Naver Map](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/naver-map-navigation/id311867728){:target="_blank"}, you can plan your itinerary and routes in advance for convenience:**

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*1vBwVg3eghUUpj729fedTg.png)

- I find it more useful than Google Maps for travel maps!
- You can log in directly using Line.

### Go!

> [_Flight Tracker, iPhone Suica usage, Visit Japan pre-entry application… I mentioned these in previous articles, so I won't elaborate here._](../76d66c2e34af/)

Visit Japan has now changed to a two-in-one system, using the same QR code for entry and customs.
### Day 1 Departure

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*6_bW1KKa9tN-N23U2TIMYg.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*5EV1yRgBxkpYmnv7GAiqlw.jpeg)

As with [previous trips abroad](../d78e0b15a08a/), when I arrived at the A1 station of the Taoyuan Airport MRT at Taipei Main Station, I first went to check in for my flight. This way, I can go directly to the airport for departure. \( [For flights eligible for check-in, please refer to the official website](https://web.taoyuan-airport.com/ITCI/mobile/index.html){:target="_blank"} \).

> I initially thought of taking the orange line to Sanchong to transfer to the MRT, but the other check-in station for the MRT is at **A3 New Taipei Industrial Park Station, not Sanchong Station**, and there are no direct trains from Sanchong Station, so I went to Taipei Main Station to transfer instead.

- As before, I placed an Airtag in my suitcase for easy tracking.

#### Taoyuan Airport TPE Terminal 1

This time, China Airlines flies to Busan from Terminal 1.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*uVNrnc4TLAij3MOTgYu-3w.png)

Upon arriving at the airport, I first looked for a counter to exchange for Korean won. Most foreign exchange ATMs do not provide Korean won and only exchange for Japanese yen; **the airport exchange rate is poor and charges a handling fee of NT$100**, so if you have time, it's still recommended to exchange currency at the bank in advance.

#### 13:00 Departure

I completed the departure procedures around 13:00.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*_g_2GJqbuSvRz7Xdh3wREQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*39eJRbcqy-ydGVe-PeWBKg.png)

I bought some Ding Guo Guo fried chicken for lunch after departing from Terminal 1.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*quYBu2QPMXc_DBK-3XFAFA.png)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*gDBfaLf3xBxSHTgOPtlcdw.png)

[Previously](../7b8a0563c157/) when passing by the scenic rest area, it was closed. This time it was open, but it turned out to be quite small.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*bzr6ymDYYo9S5RQJ5U7-gQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*7Adst9JapM1vFDR4vjhTeQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*NYeywEAKHg4JCsaanpeCkw.png)

Since it was still early, I decided to take a break in the free VIP lounge at Terminal 1, which had very few people at that time.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*w676hOGSlq7_VLmic_qM6w.jpeg)
```

```markdown
![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*4GM27e-iAZAKaIz1xC0fOQ.jpeg)

The Top Chicken is marinated and very delicious, but unfortunately, this airport location does not serve the Gua Gua Bun; additionally, **I found that all the charging stations here have been removed, leaving only the shells, and they cannot be charged**.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*G7JYzQBrzJs5KcMrdR_Mhg.png)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*gmZ3dx0HX_m4gW9z7hsG-A.jpeg)

The bathrooms are combined with toilets, and there are not many of them (approximately five by visual estimation), but they are very clean and high-end, and the cleaning staff is very timely in their work.
#### 15:20 Boarding Begins

Boarding began around 15:20.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*8xz_1jc4_DGXyg86SVKgUw.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*FkzIQV3ZkXk9qOMYU8f9lA.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*jaRFgHrva-Xpze1kNN5HMw.jpeg)

For flight BR, passengers need to take a shuttle bus to the boarding gate, and there are not many people on this flight to Busan! As shown in the picture, there are visually fewer than 30 people.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*-5USZwyH3aP5Q2TR3ehkNQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*P2SgvKzo-wd0y0zzjMRFww.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*SHj7DLo596vk2Kw9qmeSKQ.jpeg)

This China Airlines flight to Busan is a Boeing 737–800 medium-sized aircraft, and there are no entertainment screens. Bye Taiwan!

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*aHvmICF2-lHvRneqJ4F_ng.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*rBP-x-m_r7c64DySjvVgBw.jpeg)

I can only rely on the in-flight Wi-Fi to connect to entertainment content, and there are quite a few movies! There’s even "Track Day Maniac"! The in-flight meal is three cups of chicken noodles (quite unappetizing), and I didn’t expect the collaboration between [China Airlines x Wutonghao x Dinotaeng Quokka](https://www.china-airlines.com/hk/zh/discover/news/press-release/20230628){:target="_blank"} to include a short-tailed kangaroo snack.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*-HYlsrHxq7JyaM2f80tE6g.png)

Filling out the immigration card, customs card, and [quarantine QR code can be applied for in advance](https://qcode.kdca.go.kr/){:target="_blank"}; if not applied, you need to fill out an additional quarantine card.
#### 19:05 Arrive at Gimhae International Airport PUS in Busan, South Korea

The daytime temperature in Korea is about 20–25 degrees, and it may drop below 20 degrees at night; it feels a bit like autumn in Taiwan.
#### 19:20 Exit the Airport

**I exited the airport around 19:20 after going through immigration and collecting my luggage.**

At that time, I misunderstood the relationship between wowpass and tmoney, thinking it was just two cards combined; my understanding was that wowpass is a cash card that includes stored value for currency exchange and shopping, while tmoney is a transportation card, and wowpass would include tmoney; **in reality, you only need to buy tmoney, and wowpass is not necessary**. I didn’t clarify this at the time and kept looking for wowpass instead of tmoney. **There are no wowpass machines at Busan International Airport**, so I first relied on cash to buy a ticket and took the train all the way to Busan.

From Gimhae Airport to Busan Station, the subway requires three transfers; there aren’t many people on the train, so I’m not worried about crowding.

- If you have a transportation card, you can swipe it directly to enter.
- The first segment ticket is for the purple line Busan-Gimhae Light Rail from Airport Station to Sasang Station.
- Follow the floor signs to the platform.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*PXpupW70TMgeiuSS4z68Pg.png)

- After getting off at Sasang Station on the purple line, follow the signs to transfer to the green line.
- Take Line 2 of the green line to Seomyeon Station.
- Buy a second segment ticket to Seomyeon Station.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*vZJZtTRIK7IPiZwmnYxTeA.jpeg)

- After getting off at Seomyeon Station on the green line, proceed towards the orange line platform.
- Take Line 1 of the orange line to Busan Station and get off.

> Transferring from the green line to the orange line does not require exiting the platform. I am not sure if tickets can be purchased for Busan Station on the green line; I didn't pay close attention at that time. Therefore, I couldn't exit at Busan Station and needed to buy a supplementary ticket to go out.

#### Arrived at Busan Station at 20:20

Exiting the station leads directly to Toyoko Inn Busan Station No. 1.

After dropping off my luggage, I went out to find something to eat.
- Fortunately, the hotel has 100V Taiwan sockets/USB sockets, so I could use them without an adapter.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*lhZ74wf5CNcupEVEP712Ig.jpeg)

Since it was late, the nearby barbecue places were closed; I randomly found a pork soup rice restaurant to solve the problem \( [The Doi Jongga Dwaejigukbap Busan Stn\.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QhTTk1yoKsxxbAV76){:target="_blank"} \).
- The pork soup rice had a strong pork flavor, the soup was oily but not thick, and it was okay to eat with rice.
- The grilled pork neck platter was nice with lettuce and kimchi, but eating too much could be quite greasy.
- Two servings of soup rice plus one platter of pork neck cost a total of 46,000 KRW.

#### Wowpass / Tmoney

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*fmPvxhpCE7iBGKGrOj4dQw.png)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*OTrYf-hLw0i0Ypb_QELPew.png)

There is a Wowpass machine in the hotel lobby. Scan your passport and follow the instructions to complete the process, and the machine will dispense a Wowpass+tmoney two-in-one card.
- The upper part is Wowpass.
- The chip is Wowpass.
- The balance for Wowpass and Tmoney is separate.
- Wowpass can be recharged through the Wowpass machine, directly with New Taiwan Dollars, online credit card, currency exchange, or withdrawal (with a service fee).
- [**Wowpass has an expiration date**](https://wowpass.oopy.io/ct){:target="_blank"} **, and not using it for too long may cause the balance to disappear.**
- The chip part can be used for card swiping at merchants.
- Tmoney can be recharged at convenience stores or subway recharge machines.
- Currently, it is not possible to deposit into Tmoney from Wowpass (the official said it will be possible in the future).
- A deposit of 5,000 KRW is required to issue a Wowpass card, but this step seems to be optional, skipping it means free card issuance?
- **The lower part is Tmoney; remember to use the lower part when taking the subway or bus. I had trouble using the whole card for the first time, as it seemed to read the Wowpass.**

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*oXkMH-0PWzYCe72uws9pQw.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*GsMSlyD6rQTKUe8OOE9LOg.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*HPUXGyXn5Ho6NALUIwnXnA.jpeg)

- After receiving the physical card, you can bind it in the [Wowpass App](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/wowpass-%E4%B8%80%E5%8D%A1%E5%9C%A8%E6%89%8B%E6%9A%A2%E9%81%8A%E9%9F%93%E5%9C%8B/id1626691440){:target="_blank"}.
- The Wowpass App allows you to check the Wowpass balance.
- The Tmoney balance can only be known by swiping the card (how special!).
- As shown in the image, Wowpass balance is 454 KRW / Tmoney balance is 2,500 KRW.
```

**If you want to know the details of tmoney top-up and deduction, you need to install the [App (BucaCheck)](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/%E9%9F%93%E5%9C%8B%E4%BA%A4%E9%80%9A%E5%8D%A1%E9%A4%98%E9%A1%8D%E6%9F%A5%E8%A9%A2-bucacheck/id1484358047){:target="_blank"} separately:**

- It also relies on card sensing to read the content.

After dinner, I went to GS 25 to buy Korean beer and snacks. The Kelly drink is good, and the one on the right looks like spicy strips but is not as salty or spicy, making it suitable for pairing with drinks. The crab-flavored crackers are just average.

**Resting, ending the busy Day 1.**
### Day 2 Haedong Yonggungsa Temple, Haeundae, and taking the Sinseon Camellia cruise
#### Haedong Yonggungsa Temple

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*WWiPDB3eClpuLpKlHxbjeg.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*ZhiJ-W36piSutVvyFuGfuQ.png)

In the morning, I took bus `1001` from Busan Station bus stop to Haedong Yonggungsa Temple; there are many buses and not too many people.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*_gxjDvbxDC9x4uEHXyqTTA.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*pgsfh6x_vsCIDy8NjJGT1Q.jpeg)

The journey is a bit long, taking about an hour and a half. Korean buses are similar to those in Taiwan, and the drivers drive quite fast; normally, passengers get on from the front and off from the back, but some also get on from the back and off from the front.

The drop-off point is directly across from [Skyline Luge Busan](https://lizzzstyle.tw/%E9%87%9C%E5%B1%B1%E6%96%9C%E5%9D%A1%E6%BB%8A%E8%BB%8A/){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*z5zPwBfw0S8v0kAgB_mUbQ.jpeg)

After getting off, walk straight ahead, and you will see the sign for Haedong Yonggungsa Temple. Turn right and walk up the slope to reach it; the map says it takes 15 minutes, but because it's uphill, it will take about 30 minutes. If you don't want to walk, you can also take a taxi.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*e-lr8TvBxYQ42wHDMvznQA.png)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*JKPaTL69HGnuhmkgkxAq5g.png)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*xu1MAMs6MlfEdo5zCaCsTA.jpeg)

You will first pass through a shopping street, and there is also a place nearby that resembles a container market where you can take a break and grab a bite. Upon entering, you can see a row of 12 zodiac animal representations, the Year of the Dog (戌年).

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*9gAyQaGe7zq56WOVCYm3GA.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*FrZ3gRNKpoTAPF92ed9iog.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*3J_7kRsASbBE0vUGm5OI-A.jpeg)

Walking further, you will see the archway of Haedong Yonggungsa Temple, which is very colorful and distinctive.

Carefully walk down the stairs to the main hall of Haedong Yonggungsa Temple.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*RU6lY_yjJ3SfF4JP2hGu9g.jpeg)

You can first go to the observation platform on the left to overlook the entire temple.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*o5hQeLVvaCyXUoMXSSXtJw.jpeg)

Entering the Daeungjeon Hall, you can buy tiles to write your wishes (10,000 KRW).
#### Haeundae

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*kJ_RusuZ55dp8UAk9YKl8Q.jpeg)

Take bus `1001` from the Haedong Yonggungsa Temple bus stop back to Haeundae (approximately 1 hour).

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*gM8BWaQEM7tCp9YJALYusg.jpeg)

It was a sunny day, and there was a sand sculpture exhibition on the beach.

> Be careful when going down the stairs; I witnessed a Korean uncle miss a step and fall into a sand pile (thankfully it was a sand pile).

HAEUNDAE, clear blue skies.

Haeundae Beach has lifeguards, designated swimming areas, and water activities can also be arranged.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*_R7KajmVFw9-TRttjXLltQ.png)

For lunch, we had Korean barbecue at [Baegnyeon Sikdang](https://restaurantguru.com/%EB%B0%B1%EB%85%84%EC%8B%9D%EB%8B%B9-Busan-2){:target="_blank"} near Haeundae, where the staff grilled the meat for us. We ordered a portion of Korean beef ribeye and pork neck, both delicious, along with a stone pot rice that had a strong aroma of crispy rice; we shared it between two people.

We also ordered Korean beer and soju to enjoy (forgot to try the soju beer).
- Price 13.0 means 13 * 1000 = 13,000 KRW
- There were also a bunch of Korean side dishes, all pickled items, kimchi, and raw marinated crab (which should be eaten raw but was very fishy, so I didn't dare).
- The staff were nice, and their English was decent.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*GJGJNf0SA-1Pl2kJLcq4nQ.jpeg)

Next to it is the Haeundae Traditional Market, mainly selling local seafood. I bought an ice cream and walked around, then went to another shop selling ice cream croissants and had a tea-flavored ice cream croissant (crispy outside, soft inside, delicious!).

After eating, I forgot that Haeundae also has a monorail and that you can actually go up to the Haeundae LCT to take a look (I didn't research the Busan itinerary seriously at first). By this time, it was around 14:00, so I took bus `1001` back to Busan Station, thinking I would see where to go next or stroll around Busan Station.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*dgFmbSSyceOwFw9wu-UECg.png)

I returned to Busan Station around 15:00, and with the cruise check-in time at 18:30 still far off, I realized there wasn't much to do at Busan Station (it seems there are no department stores or shopping streets, or attractions). I was worried that going to Gamcheon Culture Village would be too far, so I only found out that a few stops down from Busan Station could take me to Busan Tower, where there are department stores and shopping streets nearby.

I bought the famous Korean banana milk to drink.  
#### 17:00 Head to Busan Port International Ferry Terminal

I wandered around near Busan Station until almost five o'clock, then went to the hotel to pick up my luggage and headed to Busan Port International Ferry Terminal.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*oTfJnJSRuEe6gXg03Lj9Xg.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*t-YuBDYtHl4PT7Q2Ft4l6w.jpeg)

Entering the Busan Station lobby (2nd floor), I found Exit 10 and walked along the sky bridge to reach Busan Port International Ferry Terminal (about a 15-minute walk).

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*mNQSu63iE0SFjwo0j4HoQg.jpeg)

> **_Do not walk on the ground level; there are many large vehicles, which is very dangerous._**

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*sWVya-jbAQ8IIRDKIl7R3w.jpeg)

The interior of Busan Port International Ferry Terminal (dock) is empty, with not many people, as there are very few daily sailings; aside from the route to Fukuoka Hakata, there are also cruises to Shimonoseki, Tsushima, Osaka, Kumamoto, etc.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*9YoZstBtOfQHbd2BWrARRA.png)

From the lobby, I went up to the 3rd floor for departure and first went to New Camellia to exchange my ferry ticket. (Passport required)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*hYh7Vy19A_0FjeeAlv7yEA.png)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*oETcc0VfPoTtY8HEyy_YVw.png)

Around 17:30, I started waiting to board; the waiting area is quite large; **actually, you can wander around and buy food to take on board.**

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*4ImqU8xSXgoEsTCsYQqzTQ.png)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*dTkUGCTQGyARwRkwOWdfMQ.png)

**Things to note:**
- **Hakata Port cannot use electronic clearance, so please be sure to fill out the immigration card and customs declaration card ⚠️**
- You can bring food and water, and you don't need to put them in your suitcase, as you don't need to check in luggage; your suitcase goes on board with you.
- Only handheld drinks are not allowed.
- The entire departure process is very quick; security checks are quite casual (everything goes through X-ray).

**Departure opens at 18:30.**

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*u1o60efKnEanxTzv6zfcYA.jpeg)

After departure, the waiting area is not large, with a few duty-free shops and cafes (only this one sells food), so I bought a tuna sandwich to fill my stomach.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*4bSBcZkobowODvHPlNVFEg.png)

I bought some Korean Toms Gilim almond snacks (classic honey flavor, strawberry chocolate-coated, tiramisu flavor) as souvenirs from the duty-free shop.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*UyzOZjWA8_idYSJBSvV3nw.jpeg)

After departure, you can line up with your luggage; everyone is queuing with their suitcases, preparing to board.

Koreans make up about 90%.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*Vg85ynx5rkCz5gsHry0Rfg.jpeg)

You can see Busan Port from the window, and as the time approaches, everyone returns to their luggage to prepare to board.

It takes about another 15-20 minutes to walk and wait from the dock to boarding.  
#### New Camellia

Room 430, after boarding, go up to room 430 on the 4th floor.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*MuadO5cCAf3sn6QzXrkDZg.jpeg)

The space is quite small, accommodating up to 11 people. This time, there is a family group (3 people) + two couples (4 people) + my friend and me (2 people), so it’s not fully occupied; **it seems that people who speak the same language or are from the same country are arranged together (besides one couple who are from Hong Kong and Macau, the rest are all Taiwanese)**.
- Each person's space is small, the pillows are very hard, simple mattresses, new sheets, and blankets.
- First come, first served; we happened to get a corner spot, which is slightly larger.
- There are two sockets (no adapter needed), so we can take turns charging.

After settling our luggage, it was around 20:00, and the ship will start to depart around 10:30.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*olvnolT70OYDwSE_dOWg6w.jpeg)

The 3rd floor has a restaurant and a small shop, vending machines (all **use Japanese yen**), selling slippers, toiletries, and sanitary products; the restaurant does not serve food, only instant noodles from the shop or microwave food from the vending machines; **therefore, it is recommended to bring food from Busan**.

> **_Note: Meat products cannot be brought into Japan; any leftovers must be discarded._** _⚠️_

Fortunately, I had a sandwich before boarding, so I wasn't very hungry and just bought some instant noodles to solve a meal.

> **_Note: Hot water is not available at the restaurant; there is only a cold water dispenser there; hot water can be found in the pantry near the stern of the ship, which took me a while to locate._**

> **_Additionally, be careful when operating the hot water heater; first turn on the switch, and it won't dispense water immediately; you need to wait a bit. After the water starts flowing, be cautious when using it, and please ensure it is turned off tightly after use to avoid scalding the next person._**

After eating, I went out on deck for a stroll (you can come and go freely, but be careful as it may be slippery).

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*1ANn7dZVvikH-seyMSHd4A.jpeg)

Around 21:00, another ferry to Shimonoseki (PUKWAN FERRY) will depart first.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*HlZnQjk3DbPcZj88_9qu_g.jpeg)

Around 22:30, the ship will start to leave Busan Port, passing under the Busan Port Bridge, and the night view of the bridge is very beautiful. (It will be cold, so please dress warmly.)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*AoZDlJlBUvMoXnuooLy8UA.jpeg)

The economy class dormitory will turn off the lights at 11 o'clock, and after watching the departure, it will be about time to lie down.
- Only the deluxe rooms have private bathrooms; the others are shared.
- **The bathroom is a public bath in Japanese style, requiring complete nudity, and there are small partitions in the shower area; since I didn't have the courage to go, I didn't take a shower.**
- Overall, the facilities are quite old, but they are kept clean.
- There is a recreation room and KTV.
- The public spaces will not turn off the lights.
- The internet will remain connected at least until after departure at around 11 o'clock (it is said that there might be a small section without internet).
- As we approach Tsushima Island, we will enter Japanese territory, and it is necessary to switch to a Japanese SIM card.
- **The ship will sway slightly while sailing, so those who are prone to seasickness may need to take motion sickness medication.**
```

**Good night, Busan.**  
### Day 3 Hakata, Yutoku Inari Shrine

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*rtVDG1FjwdJiJkiSBNFY3A.jpeg)

**Arrived in Busan around 5:30 AM, the lights in the common areas turned on**; stepping onto the deck, I saw the calm Hakata Port and Hakata Port Tower in the early morning.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*HooeI9R4hfpCMl-7V8bSbw.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*lYylWj4EABiFD8I7s7X8cA.jpeg)

Those who purchased breakfast can go to the restaurant; we didn't, so we slowly freshened up, wandered around the deck, and packed our things to prepare to disembark.

Once outside, there are buses to Hakata Station or Tenjin area.
- Although it's inconvenient to take the bus with large luggage, since this is the departure station, there will definitely be seats, and most people also have luggage, making it less awkward.
- There will be some people getting on at the intermediate stops, but not many, so it's fine.
- On weekday mornings, there aren't many people taking the subway back to Hakata, so there's no need to worry about awkwardness (Kyushu is spacious!).

#### Around 9:30, after dropping off luggage at the hotel, we went to the food street in Hakata Station department store for a morning clam soup set meal to fill our stomachs, and picked up our JR Pass & tickets for the train to Yufuin tomorrow morning.

#### Yutoku Inari Shrine

Originally planned to go to Karatsu Castle, but after checking the JR limited express schedule, it was quicker and closer to go to Yutoku Inari Shrine, plus due to yesterday's fatigue, we decided to change our itinerary.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*teCoD6hIOJbZ7Tud_EGC2w.jpeg)

Took the train from Hakata to Kashima City - Hizen Kashima Station.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*IZC0DIzqt030dHz2WYTdcQ.jpeg)

After exiting the station, walk left along the road to wait for the bus at stop 2 across the street.

> _This is different from Google Maps' instructions, which directed me to walk to Nakamuta Station to wait for the bus, about 500 meters away._

> _**Please note that I visited in June 2024, and the platform may change over time.**_

#### Yutoku Inari Shrine

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*ZR9i0oFvt3-lo_hTnD_WSQ.jpeg)

After getting off in front of Yutoku Shrine, walk back to reach the Omotesando.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*ExcKo7kaHF1V9AAN2_zk2w.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*ak70mzjgEsxPnxhUTYtaUQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*-C-Aq4gENwNHFtRKHdn3PA.jpeg)

I don't know if it's because it's a weekday, but there were hardly any people on Omotesando, and not many shops were open.

Walking all the way to the end (about 15 minutes), you will reach the shrine.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*XWqTjrNhxKyHvj9d0lLkEw.jpeg)

At the entrance of the shrine, the glass building behind is the elevator; if you don't want to walk up, you can [pay to take the elevator](https://www.ana.co.jp/zh/tw/japan-travel-planner/saga/0000006.html){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*9GCSK1p5fao9n-cDOIAqhw.jpeg)

As you walk up, there will be a row of prayer wind chimes. When I went, there was no one around, and just as I passed the wind chimes, a gust of wind made them ring loudly.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*JfPzmr9xXQJTU8kj1MHtwA.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*1_-KmstmoaSDNomra-ACgA.jpeg)

All the way through the row of torii gates and the beautifully blooming hydrangeas, you can continue climbing to the Okunoin (about 200M, very steep and difficult to walk).

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*KjC3OrPtsjZf5tyAXruK0A.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*FJU-YXMY9euc6A9aJZjsuw.jpeg)

After the worship, I returned to the station and headed back to JR.

I compared the Ooyama Shrine's sea torii gate with Karatsu Castle and felt that the sea torii gate was quite ordinary ( [after all, I have seen the grand torii gate at Itsukushima Shrine](../31b9b3a63abc/) ), and the transportation was quite troublesome, so I planned to go to Karatsu.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*4aPS2yThWhLAae4Dmqvpsg.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*LikNxDBhLjCONrLiG0ZKnQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*PXSz9erwvG2xj1oO2E7PcA.jpeg)

I made a mistake while changing trains; this was a small station with no electronic boards. When I got off, I saw the platform sign saying "Karatsu direction" and thought I should change trains at that platform. As a result, when the time came, the train passed through another platform, and I couldn't get on in time.

After studying it carefully, I realized that I needed to look at the box in the lower right corner of the timetable to find the correct waiting platform, as the platforms might not be the same on weekdays and holidays.

Since I missed the train to Karatsu and couldn't return to the Ooyama Shrine's sea torii gate, and after yesterday's mishap, I decided to head straight back to my hotel in Hakata to rest.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*8REi4oDauoYz6z6RB6QxTQ.jpeg)

> _On the way back, I discovered something interesting. I was wondering why the train doors didn't open at the small station (I was sitting in the back carriage); upon closer observation, I found that at a small station without any staff, the train conductor is the station staff. To get off, you have to exit from the first carriage and pay the fare by inserting coins or swiping a transport card (just like on a bus). If you use a JR Pass, you only need to show it to the driver._

> **_Additionally, I want to remind you again that if you are exiting a JR station without staff, you can just walk out with your JR Pass; do not drop your JR Pass into the ticket collection box._** _⚠️_

#### Around 16:00, returned to Hakata, hotel

After putting my clothes in the washing machine, I went to the underground shopping area of Hakata Station to find something to eat.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*Ee7X3DWzceXOV_j0kz2LfA.jpeg)

I bought a steak bento to eat back at the hotel, which was great; the tea and sake were okay, not much flavor.

**Laundry (30 mins), drying (1 hr), rest.**
### Day 4 Yufuin, Oita

> [_Reference itinerary: KKday One Day Tour in Fukuoka and Oita, Kyushu | Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine, Yufuin (Yufuin), Beppu Sea Hell & Kamado Hell | Departing from Hakata (Chinese, English, Japanese correspondence)_](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/125898?cid=19365&ud1=cb65fd5ab770){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*bQJh8KgZHl_sMt0c7sJ41A.jpeg)

Early in the morning, I checked out and dragged my luggage to JR Hakata Station to take `Yufu 1` to Yufuin.
- Luggage can be placed in the luggage compartment; if you're worried about it sliding, you can place it horizontally.
- A cup of coffee to wake up the mind.
- The scenery along the way is not particularly beautiful this season, just green all around (or is it only Yufuin no Mori that has scenery?).

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*kmSnvrFxzy7h8BE43wcHGg.png)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*y87E38-k0PyXDEJYxSmSpw.jpeg)

**As soon as I arrived at Yufuin Station, I immediately turned right to the Coin Lockers to store my luggage, as there are fewer spots available for suitcases. (1,000 yen)**

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*1OMbUAbtx_8UqX1EuFUjVw.png)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*QfOYlbsgLcrRRSKA3BuXiQ.jpeg)

Perhaps due to the season and weather, I felt that the overall tone was gray and green, without any particularly striking feelings.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*v7WzI0VN2zh_YbJ9VqYteA.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*zjptOdU4U7uNn8gFtXdj7A.jpeg)

Walking along the street leads directly to Kinrin Lake, where the green lakeside reveals a hint of tranquility.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*0XNCB-6iwRneujWYY6TIgg.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*g4zXtYfMDfnse0dA2ymWwA.jpeg)

Kinrin Lake is very clean and clear, with many maple leaves (not yet changed color).

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*r97vWFzxpav-kCTzTYufwQ.jpeg)

Along the street from Yufuin Station to Kinrin Lake, there are many IP and cultural creative shops to browse. If you're interested in food, you can check out the Yufuin Gold Award desserts, which include pudding, ice cream, and more.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*YQQUziH5AazGgiXJDBOtUA.jpeg)

Of course, you can't miss the Totoro Forest, Ghibli characters, and the "Kyushu specialty" Kumamon that can be seen everywhere.

```

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*0wnmcY3hsduBKj2baiXujw.jpeg)

The Showa-kan in Yufuin has a strong sense of traditional Japanese style.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*kri-WMMQEWLq9JgpFz2NFA.png)

The Flower Village looked too touristy and crowded, so we didn't go in to take a closer look.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*sYQhx3oxoDripKxxQzbd7A.jpeg)

On the way, we bought the famous pudding dorayaki and some souvenirs (sesame powder, Yufuin brick factory - Seven Lucky Gods, cultural and creative items, incense Yufuin incense…).

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*BtZcLacSVi9WJ9sPLvC-UQ.jpeg)

For lunch, we originally planned to eat at Yufumabushi Shin, famous for its Yufuin kamameshi, with one location at Kinrin Lake and another at the station exit. The one at the station exit was closed that day, and we were too lazy to walk back to the main store, so we opted for [Sushi Gen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AMLzf3ExBFs5gHnf9){:target="_blank"} on the first floor instead.

I had the Bungo beef steak, and my friend had a rice bowl; the beef was very delicious, fragrant, juicy, and had no fishy taste, and the price was reasonable.

**After eating, we strolled around and by around 15:00, we took the train to continue towards Oita.**

**There are quite a few trains from Yufuin to Oita, and there were not many people (maybe more people were returning to Hakata?). There are also local trains, and this time we took the local train directly, practicing the new Japanese we learned:**
```
この電車は大分に行きますか。
はい、大分に行きます。
```
#### 16:20 Oita

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*15JhN--vbUQ-FHt8EE7eoQ.jpeg)

We happened to encounter an installation art display at Oita Station (it even makes sounds).

Oita gives off a vibe of being far from the hustle and bustle; while wandering around the city, it felt unusually quiet, with only the faint sound of car engines and not much noise from people or vehicles.

[![Toyoko INN Oita Station Front](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/39b5_hqdefault.jpg "Toyoko INN Oita Station Front")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5qU-lbZTu8){:target="_blank"}

First, we went to the hotel to drop off our luggage. The layout of Toyoko INN is quite similar; we happened to get a room with the same layout and angle as the one in front of Hakata Station yesterday, with the difference being that this one had a larger bathroom and a smaller hallway.

It was still early, so we thought we would wander around the area and casually opened Google Maps to see nearby attractions.
#### **Giant Bougainvillea**

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*NiEmhCvjpIE7DmhOGkC1UA.jpeg)

On the way to the Oita Castle ruins, there was a giant bougainvillea in the park parking lot (it looked like some curse from Jujutsu Kaisen).

#### Oita Castle Ruins

All that remains of Oita Castle are the moat, castle walls, and courtyard, which contains an open parking lot and a platform for the tenshu, where you can overlook the city of Oita.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*aQV5bBGP-tgTe6bv0ZoSnQ.jpeg)

The official site provides an [AR App](https://apps.apple.com/hk/app/%E5%BA%9C%E5%86%85%E5%9F%8Ear/id1328720439){:target="_blank"} that allows you to see what Oita Castle looked like in the past.

Strolling back to the station market for food, the buses in Oita have a vintage feel but are well maintained.

For dinner, I wasn't sure what to eat, so I casually bought a pork cutlet rice and a Suntory non-alcoholic sparkling drink (delicious!); Japan's sauce packets are thoughtfully designed with a small corner for easy opening.

For a late-night snack, I had strawberry smoothie ice cream, barbecue, and Kirin's limited edition pineapple beer (sufficiently pineapple-flavored and a bit sweet).

### Day 5 Beppu Hell, Beppu

> _Reference itinerary:_

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*zA4Ob_gIYacQFs-SO9K-OQ.jpeg)

The JR Limited Express from Oita Station to Beppu Station takes only about 15 minutes, and the scenery along the way feels a bit like [the trip from Hiroshima to Kure](../31b9b3a63abc/).

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*ytBrs15nnhGhDm7iECNNwA.png)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*6mb-484W_XcaWm5DfP49zA.jpeg)

After getting off the JR train, I transferred to a bus heading to Beppu Hell — the first stop is the Sea Hell, and the order can be referenced in the itinerary above.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*EwBmwVW_PDfRiCBisiyoMA.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*xFe-6-ZK-9NHOwnP0LxT-Q.jpeg)

- I wanted to visit all 7 hells, so I bought a full set of 7 tickets at the entrance of the Sea Hell, which is cheaper.
- If time is limited, I think you can just go to the Sea Hell.
- To enter, simply tear off a corner of the ticket and drop it into the box.
- Each hell has a free foot bath area for relaxation.

#### Sea Hell

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*PwUSLWRX9AEPyWqjJbswRw.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*6YnRN7_a6ZxpcAMHqheoqw.jpeg)

I think the Sea Hell is the most spectacular, with constantly churning steam and azure spring water.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*R-XcFRFQVdSUoMcx6BDV3w.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*BnpBNzMMgXVFYOotyaivVg.jpeg)

There is a terrace and a small shrine in the back.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*KMaRjv1_MB6sN28qPpPF9A.jpeg)

The small blood pond on the other side is also quite special.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*sKr5pXC4LsZuGsxGdxw-Eg.jpeg)

After exiting the Sea Hell, just follow the signs to reach the next hell, the Oniishi Bozu Hell.

#### Oniishi Bozu Hell

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*g40LD23BN5Lc3sI2qmYudA.png)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*6QpMMS8inrYi-qJIRrXMCA.jpeg)

It mainly features mud geysers.
```

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*JRk6Am_fUq4rNbclDcpUiQ.jpeg)

There is a sign pointing to the next hell.

#### Kamado Hell

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*mqjiwMhcR7giMSrkxP6qGQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*mCsyTkywF9mVT9jUd_PjvQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*UYtcUCm686iUF4ss8pfEqg.jpeg)

The milk pool in Kamado Hell feels great for soaking.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*0Lko7mjFltTpsuoD1jag6Q.png)

However, the feature of Kamado Hell is not the springs, but the smoke. The staff use incense sticks and blow air towards the steam of the hot spring, creating a large amount of smoke, which is very interesting (the explanation says this is because the particles of the incense stick attract more water vapor molecules, causing aggregation).

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*nTzZrdLALvWmShvXlVZM8A.png)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*6aVM09EnI9smU3G5v4-Cxg.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*26axPDiJoE9jerkuSdZiyw.png)

Another feature of Kamado Hell is the row of hot spring experiences, including rock foot baths, drinking hot spring water (which tastes a bit thick and salty), foot soaks, facial steaming, hand steaming, and throat steaming (similar to visiting a pediatrician in Taiwan XD).

This area is larger, with more experiences available, and the shop sells some food, allowing for a place to rest.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*npCmTOs_GxDfBlPYfY3ziA.jpeg)

You can also see the sign pointing to the Hell of the Demon Mountain.

#### Hell of the Demon Mountain

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*QoH55zFAJtmmtXSMQ-T9uA.jpeg)

The water in the Hell of the Demon Mountain boils more violently, constantly surging outward.

On the other side of the park is the crocodile exhibit.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*jhYXhMiHo4YzRBvJNY607A.jpeg)

Following the signs down leads to the White Pond Hell.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*Wgi_UYj0U8jVKJpChX_eOA.jpeg)

You will pass the Hell Hot Spring Museum (café), where you can take a break.

#### White Pond Hell

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*mWRksHgYSIswtZZRYA_ggg.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*bAaLljqG-70u58IccdjQ3A.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*1sVUQ-Qb6MWzFuPXb2mNKA.jpeg)

White Pond Hell is less distinctive, featuring a small tropical fish aquarium.

The remaining Hell of Blood Pond and Tornado Hell are not in this area and require a bus transfer to reach.

First, visit the Hell of Blood Pond, which has a small blood pond similar to the Sea Hell, but on a larger scale.

Walking down leads to Tornado Hell.

#### Tornado Hell

The Tornado Hell is an intermittent geyser that erupts approximately every 30–40 minutes, lasting about 6–10 minutes each time. You can ask the staff at Tornado for assistance (we proactively inform and assist). If it’s about to erupt, you can come to watch; if you have to wait, you can first visit the Blood Pond Hell.

The smoke during the eruption forms a tornado, hence the name.
#### Paradise Pavilion

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*flj9yliiQKlWV-ynhTCL0g.png)

Lunch was directly at the Blood Pond Hell's Paradise Pavilion.

I had the signature Hell Paradise Curry, enjoying the Japanese-style fluffy rice paired with thick curry (mildly spicy), accompanied by grilled vegetables and chicken, making it light and refreshing.

**After eating, I found out there are nearby attractions like Kifune Castle, Cross Mountain Observatory, Myoban Hell, and Yuno Hana…**
#### Kifune Castle

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*qJnUe1YHZJtt46eekp73Xw.jpeg)

On the way back to the Tetsuryu 2 bus stop, I thought about visiting Kifune Castle. The castle is small, but the view from the lookout is nice; however, it’s quite tiring to walk from the bus stop and up the hill.

> _The Cross Mountain Observatory, Myoban Hell, and Yuno Hana are actually located above the Sea Hell; if planning the itinerary again, it would be better to visit these attractions first before heading down to the Sea Hell, and then to the Blood Pond Hell and Tornado Hell, or vice versa, starting with Blood Pond and Tornado first._

#### Cross Mountain Observatory

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*KxJzpeSn1_oyD7uOl8Mn6A.jpeg)

Returning to Tetsuryu 2, I took the bus passing by Sea Hell to head to the Cross Mountain Observatory, overlooking Beppu City; the sun was very bright and hot, and the observatory only had a restroom, with no shops or resting areas.

The mountain across from the entrance is beautifully green.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*Ec9WvtL7vyDAmzwPZEFfRg.jpeg)

Since it’s a night view, there’s not much to see in the morning; it’s just very sunny.
#### Myoban Hell

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*XDVdOKrLnRiog34FbKp-yQ.jpeg)

Going back down to Myoban Hell, the ticket office is at the opposite [Okamotoya Pudding Shop](https://www.okamotoya.net/){:target="_blank"}, just show the staff that you want to go across.

The Yuno Hana Hut is used to dry the hot spring to obtain crystals, and if you go up to the Yuno Hana shop, they sell this hot spring bath additive.

I bought some bath bombs, face masks, and creams as souvenirs at the Kyu-Tan no Hana shop.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*5ZvewcbDuvYgIecpZxmbtA.jpeg)

Additionally, there is a Private Bath available for those who might feel shy about using public baths.

**It was around 4:00 PM, and I was preparing to take the bus back to the city.**
#### Beppu

After returning to Beppu Station, I walked to Beppu Tower, casually exploring along the way. (Statue in front of the station, old hot spring hall, Great Tengu)
#### Beppu Tower

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*rtIyLpX4pGHrDZP0CfwpjA.jpeg)

I bought a ticket from the vending machine on the first floor of Beppu Tower and took the elevator up to enjoy a bird's-eye view of the cityscape in the Beppu coastal area.

Seeing the streets and cars from above was very soothing.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*BO25G0GD9hBy24Hjj8J1CQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*1YsShYUh50Vg2qzli3DvqA.jpeg)

There is a meteorite exhibition inside the tower.

> _Besides Beppu Tower, you can also visit the cable car or the new Beppu World Tower._

**Headed back to the hotel to rest.**

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*LGokjNUrME62f-Ret1CkGg.png)

After resting at the hotel, I went to the Oita Station market to buy dinner, a pork cutlet bento, and a locally produced fruit wine (refreshing and not too sweet).

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*TcIWzQFJTcGgfwyGxy61Wg.jpeg)

For dessert/snacks, I had fried shrimp, instant noodles, white peach ice cream, and jasmine tea (which I don't particularly like).
### Day 6 Shimonoseki, Karatsu

> [_KKday itinerary reference: One-day charter tour in Fukuoka and Kitakyushu, including Dazaifu Tenmangu, Mojiko, Karato Market, Kanmon Strait, and Akama Shrine_](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/157874?cid=19365&ud1=d78e0b15a08a){:target="_blank"}

Starting from Oita to Kokura, then to Mojiko and Shimonoseki, **Shimonoseki and Karatsu are about 140 kilometers apart, and normally, one wouldn't run such an itinerary**; however, since I missed Karatsu on my first day in Japan due to taking the wrong train, I really wanted to hit this spot, so I forced myself to do a military-style one-day trip to Shimonoseki.

I woke up late, around 8:40 AM, and took the JR Limited Express to Kokura, planning to leave my luggage in Kokura and then take a local line to Mojiko.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*JBaQT0-EE8_KFsmevoB18g.jpeg)

It started to drizzle in Oita, and I realized that every city I had visited had encountered rain. ( **The rain god is indeed accurate** )

I arrived at Kokura Station around 10 AM, wandered around for a long time, and found that all the self-service [luggage lockers](https://cloak.ecbo.io/zh-TW/jpn/city/fukuoka/43){:target="_blank"} were full (a friend said he came at 9 AM and there were still spots), and the manual counter for luggage storage only opened at 11 AM, so I had to drag my luggage directly to Mojiko to see if I could find a solution.
```

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*qaYRJm9eP4JPaz3LXjGAvg.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*3OoNx7R67e5vwXrydIVYgg.png)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*Y_ZDcjI9hgcu_PC93Ds7mA.jpeg)

After exiting the Mojiko Station, head directly to the left (without leaving the building) to find the self-service Coin Lockers. There were quite a few people at Mojiko this time, and all the lockers were full; fortunately, the manual luggage storage window had already started operating, allowing for a smooth luggage drop-off ( **but note that the manual service only operates until 8 PM!** ⚠️).

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*0EvlQ9tL_CKmgXte8KHe9A.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*j02dc0biONGFl0CzJc3Lng.jpeg)

I initially thought about having some [Mojiko curry rice, which had no line when I came last year](../d78e0b15a08a/), but upon exiting the station and seeing a long queue, I gave up and turned right to wait for the bus to Shimonoseki.

#### Shimonoseki

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*VrGYQTikKM7_vt6S7mg3ng.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*QiREcfAbQACM9w83Dwk9Vw.jpeg)

I got off at the underground pedestrian walkway in Shimonoseki, and this time I viewed the [Kanmon Bridge](https://www.gururich-kitaq.com/tw/spot/kanmon-bridge){:target="_blank"} from a different angle. **The image on the right shows the view from the [Mojiko Nostalgic Observation Room last year](../d78e0b15a08a/)**.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*i5nBD_DkM5dhdPwiggSzAQ.jpeg)

Here, there is a torii gate for the Hōbukiyama Shrine, and on the mountain behind it, there is the Hōbukiyama Shrine and its observation deck.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*9XnRVgOLps20q43WGio8Xg.jpeg)

Taking the elevator from the pedestrian walkway entrance to B1 leads to the pedestrian zone. Entry is free for pedestrians, but bicycles are charged a 20 yen toll. Additionally, wild boars may appear in this area, so be cautious XD.

The total length is 780 meters, leading straight to the end, and there will be a dividing line in the middle.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*ird0fBvbi1JSHNV-3ZFAgQ.jpeg)

After arriving at Shimonoseki, there are shops selling simple snacks outside, and I bought a takoyaki to fill my stomach. (The inside is chewy, the skin is crispy, and there are indeed octopus pieces—delicious!)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*9jVXC3cIB_sS2AcvEqz2wA.jpeg)

From the opposite angle, you can see the Kanmon Bridge and the Mojiko Nostalgic Observation Room, reminiscent of the view from Bali in Taiwan looking at Tamsui.

I walked along the coast all the way to the Karato Market.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*HBrB1kac3JkchWl4eH80LQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*F2rNN0rBZH5Q_K4QIRKVCQ.jpeg)

On the way to Karato Market, I passed by the Akama Shrine and stopped by to pay my respects.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*-bCSSH9aVeW_FRWOHlDkxg.png)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*2o6KtFuHaiUkRiBiIRh8xA.png)

Outside the Karato Market, many people buy food and picnic by the coast. Although it was crowded, it was still very clean. Since I mainly came to scout the area and don’t eat raw food, I didn’t go inside to take a look. It seemed quite busy around lunchtime.

Crossing the唐戶市場, you can take a ferry directly back to門司港. You can buy tickets at the automatic ticket machines in the shops across the street; if you have time, you can also visit岩流島 (Come! The Holy Land of Duels!) for a stroll.

It takes about 10 minutes to reach門司港. (It really feels like the淡水八里 ferry!)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*XkeRjn9UaLcRQ46UuufV2A.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*ONw3t7P2YCmPJw0Idm6uDg.png)

As I returned to門司港, it started to rain. [I visited門司港 last year](../d78e0b15a08a/), so I didn't stay long and prepared to head to the station to collect my luggage and depart for小倉 and博多.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*TiX7jGsW3W35S7M3MLzTGg.jpeg)

It was around 14:00, and I estimated that I would arrive at唐津城 around 4:30. Time was of the essence, so I activated the power of New Taiwan Dollars (Japanese Yen) in小倉 and directly purchased a ticket for the山陽新幹線 from小倉 to博多, which travels at a world record speed of 300 km/h, **only taking 15 minutes to arrive (the JR Limited Express takes 45 minutes, and the local train takes 65 minutes).**

> _The JR Pass does not cover the山陽新幹線 (小倉博多 section). If you want to take the Nozomi or Mizuho trains, you need to buy tickets separately at the Shinkansen platform. Scanning the JR Pass will be denied entry, and if you happen to enter and exit, you will also be denied and will need to pay a supplement ( [based on last time's experience](../d78e0b15a08a/)). ⚠️_

From JR唐津, it takes about 20 minutes to walk to唐津城. Taking the express bus will drop you off at the bridge in front of唐津城, so I decided to run to catch the express bus. (This was also my first time taking it!)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*Anvajmyw7UIFnmArtiagzw.png)

After arriving in博多, I took the subway to天神南 and completed my luggage drop-off in the underground shopping area. (I was lucky to find the last luggage spot at number 2.)

From the west exit 8 of天神地下街, follow the signs to Fukuoka Mitsukoshi三越百貨 and head towards the天神高速巴士總站 on the 3rd floor to reach the bus station.

**Since I wasn't sure whether to reserve a seat and buy a ticket, I went directly to the counter to buy a ticket.** After purchasing the ticket, I was very hungry, so I casually bought a bread at Starbucks and went to queue at the designated platform. (I found out that there was no need to reserve a seat for唐津, and I could use a transportation card, just like taking a bus; regardless of which station you get off, the fare is fixed at 1,100 yen.)

**At 15:02, I boarded the express bus to唐津 (寶當棧橋), with an occupancy rate of about 80%.**

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*Zg6HyNTj8inP4D3Hje2oRw.jpeg)

Mainly Japanese commuters were on board, and after passing唐津市區, I was the only one left on the bus. I was heading to the last stop — **寶當棧橋.**

After getting off the bus, walk a little forward to reach the Bōdō Bridge, and if you continue walking back, you'll find Karatsu Castle; seeing this view of the bridge and castle makes the journey worthwhile.

Arriving here around 16:35, there are only 25 minutes left before Karatsu Castle closes, but since I’m already here, I thought I might as well take a stroll.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*--GFNk6cyNLNfY_P45BAYQ.jpeg)

To reach Karatsu Castle, you need to walk up a slope from below. With time running out, I directly turned left to take the elevator up to Maizuru Park.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*kZ85Aa3Xcwm7bqd5lKSrrw.jpeg)

The elevator ride costs 100 yen one way; just buy a ticket from the vending machine at the entrance and hand it to the staff.

The main keep is closed for visits, so I just came up to enjoy the view and see Karatsu Castle.

I returned to the entrance before the elevator doors closed and followed the sightseeing map back to JR Karatsu Station on foot.

It was cloudy in the morning, and it was the last day of the JR Pass. There was no way to change the itinerary, so I had to continue taking the train to Sasebo.

[![JR 九州車內廣播 / JR 九州車内放送 / JR Kyushu Train Announcement](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/0a76_hqdefault.jpg "JR 九州車內廣播 / JR 九州車内放送 / JR Kyushu Train Announcement")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9mowwPa84){:target="_blank"}

After exiting Sasebo Station, cross the road to the opposite side and walk back to find bus stop number 6, heading to "Ninety-Nine Islands Aquarium."

Transfer to the bus and get off at the Ninety-Nine Islands Aquarium stop. After about a 5-minute walk, you will reach the Ninety-Nine Islands sightseeing boat visitor center, where you can buy tickets to board the boat. (Show your JR Pass for a discount)

This time, I took the white Pearl Queen ship on the left at 11:00.

It was pouring rain, and the weather was poor. I couldn't become a pirate king; I could only hold an umbrella, feel the wind, and get wet in the rain.

After the tour where we saw very little due to the heavy rain, we returned to Sasebo.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*Kb5YMskeGrcvM8wv-x_M9A.png)

On the way back, we stopped by [**Honey House**](https://g.co/kgs/E62XtpZ){:target="_blank"} to **taste the famous Sasebo lemon steak.**

The lemon steak consists of four thin slices of steak + sauce + lemon slices + lemon juice, offering a refreshing taste, though the portion of meat is slightly insufficient.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*LvQ3Y4jLPkws5bDSa-Q9kg.jpeg)

After eating, we ordered another local specialty, the fruit cream puff, which was filled with generous amounts of filling and real fruit chunks inside.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*L8KEGS6sH_sf-ON4mSzjRw.png)

After finishing, we strolled around the shopping street before taking the bus back to the station.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*t_jh7YUR9GOgCxGJ1oh32A.jpeg)

We took the train heading back (to Hakata, Takeo Onsen), and since this is the terminal station, we had to wait for the cleaning staff to finish before boarding; just like when we came, the train would run backward from Early to Sasebo.

At this time, it was around 13:30.

Last time I passed through Takeo Onsen while changing trains to Nagasaki, I didn't have much impression of this station. Later, I followed [Takeo City's tourism IG](https://www.instagram.com/takeokankou/){:target="_blank"} (the official account regularly holds events, such as free shuttle services for firefly viewing, so those planning to stay in Takeo for hot springs can follow). This time, I thought it would be nice to stop by since I was passing through and had some time.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*4tNTkTZiavECFb_naUHmJw.jpeg)

From Takeo Onsen Station (a non-staffed station, no need to insert JR Pass, just exit), the streets outside are also sparsely populated and very quiet.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*afSAvKezy3x6Y-NJWOHz5Q.png)

Just passing by and taking a quick look, I only went to the main attractions I found, which happened to be diagonal from each other. The bus frequency is low, and I didn't want to wait, so I walked directly.

First, I went to Takeo Shrine, and on the way, I passed by the Tsukasaki Great Camphor Tree, a small attraction.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*c9EddfQuCjwuLeRPjM_VLQ.jpeg)

The Tsukasaki Great Camphor Tree is estimated to be 2,000 years old.
#### Takeo Shrine

From below, you need to walk a short flight of stairs up to Takeo Shrine.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*lHYTplPdyTbgg1klIwTb_A.jpeg)

After passing through the sacred tree torii next to Takeo Shrine and walking for about 5 minutes, you can see the legendary Takeo Great Camphor Tree. (Estimated age: 3,000 years)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*NPvDe3nuhD845VdiUt0BSQ.jpeg)

The Takeo Great Camphor Tree is enclosed, so you can only view it from a distance.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*bHrgBRPxijWPCmN-Z6XYmw.png)

I bought a Takeo Shrine Great Camphor Amulet (1,500 yen), which is larger and comes in a wooden box.

After visiting Takeo Shrine, I walked back to see the other side of the Hōraikyū entrance.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*2-WrDsROdeHWLRCm_JQCRQ.jpeg)

> **_The entire hot spring street was deserted, with several hot springs and accommodations to choose from (not necessarily Hōraikyū). It feels like if you want to come to Kyushu for a hot spring experience with fewer people and tranquility plus convenient transportation, Takeo Onsen is a great choice!_**

#### Hōraikyū Entrance

A visit here.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*jlWAEiAqh5D-S6jk65EmQQ.png)

After entering the entrance, you can enjoy the hot spring at Hōraikyū, and on the other side, there is the onsen accommodation Sagi no Yu.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*mbLIwhhb_LYLbi8b9ROJkw.jpeg)

I took the limited express train to Hakata, arriving around 18:00.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*6xwbcE8QOWxo6zwxdEtOow.jpeg)

Strolling back to the hotel, I casually solved dinner at a convenience store with rice balls, a pork cutlet sandwich, and **Fujiya peach soda (delicious!!)**; after staying at APA and Toyoko Inn so many times, I finally discovered they all have ice machines, which is fantastic!

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*b5deyM_7wD1BR4mWjdHWoQ.jpeg)

Aside from the old facilities, this APA's room size and view are really nice.
### Day 8 Sakurai Futamigaura Meoto Iwa, Nanzoin, Hakata Pilgrimage

No more JR Pass.

> [_KKday charter itinerary reference: "【Fukuoka Charter Day Tour】Fukuoka Prefecture, Kyushu, Japan｜Fukuoka Tower, Dazaifu Tenmangu, Ohori Park, Karatsu, Sakurai Futamigaura, Yobuko Morning Market, Itoshima, Tenjin Underground Shopping Street｜Flexible itinerary!"_](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/144234?cid=19365&ud1=cb65fd5ab770){:target="_blank"}

#### Sakurai Futamigaura Meoto Iwa

After checking out of the hotel early in the morning, I took the JR train to Kyudai Gakkentoshi Station.
```

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*uDVufR5iECLMTiub5pOkrA.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*utthCTm_7XV-harklgTCCA.png)

To the left after exiting the station is the platform for the [**Nishi-no-Ura Line**](https://japantravel.navitime.com/zh-tw/area/jp/railroad/00053916/){:target="_blank"}, where staff are available to provide guidance. The travel time is approximately 30 minutes.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*sLgglHG-UmKzahXEsBEmoA.jpeg)

The fare is the highest I have ever paid for a bus, at 730 yen.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*qipiHncZtTcCwWcvyVKBag.jpeg)

After getting off, you will find the Futami-Iwa (Wedded Rocks) in Sakurai.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*N2_TcHs0rbvnM2fHMq2PzA.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*mC7_Yc_5BmtpyaTMIs0Xhw.png)

It looks beautiful and tranquil up close.

> _After this, you can continue to Sakurai Shrine (which is said to attract many fans due to its name being the same as a member of the Japanese group Arashi) or head further to the [**Akiya Daimon Sightseeing Boat**](https://www.crossroadfukuoka.jp/tw/experience/12362){:target="_blank"} **(it looks very cool!)**._ 

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*t-VtH8X-XPasrDRpz8NjTA.png)

The return schedule shows that there is a direct train to Hakata every hour in the afternoon, and one back to Kyushu University Research City Station every hour.

**Returning to Hakata around 12:30, let's go find something to eat.**

[**Revisit**](../d78e0b15a08a/) [Hakata Miyachiku (Japan's No. 1 Miyazaki Beef Specialty Store)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FomFZet8BhoBpU4a7){:target="_blank"} to enjoy a Miyazaki beef business lunch.

The business lunch has an extremely high cost-performance ratio (the dinner is a high-end barbecue set) + a private room, perfect for those with social anxiety.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*kXQpU6NitfMV2wp4rkINFA.jpeg)

This time I ordered the lean meat set, 200g for 3,200 yen, and I devoured two bowls of rice (refills for the rice soup are free).

#### Nanzoin

After returning to Hakata, take the train to Nanzoin-mae Station.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*oSE_4row0P7rcpdp790_kw.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*aulydFgjA6yzCNJ39Us84A.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*g2mu0STk92aH6EHP65J-vg.jpeg)

After exiting the station, walk straight out, passing by the Arakami Tea House (where you can rest and have lunch), and cross the road to reach the entrance of Nanzoin.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*PWW3wppposkxv4adkkQtfw.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*sFYEe144nEDzOv8OrNYiow.jpeg)

- Walk to the right to visit the Reclining Buddha; on the left, there are also statues for love, peace, and Fudō Myōō.
- Nanzoin is a private institution and has many areas where photography is prohibited, so please adhere to the rules.
**No short sleeves, shorts, exposing the stomach or shoulders, playing music, dancing, or photography (e.g., at the entrance cave with the row of tablets, Fudō Myōō statue).**

After arriving at the platform, you can see the reclining Buddha statue, with scriptures on the soles of its feet. The overall sight is quite magnificent and solemn.

**After the visit, I took the train back to Hakata Station, arriving around 15:40.**
#### Hakata Pilgrimage

Adding some [locations I missed during my last trip to Kyushu](../d78e0b15a08a/).

**Gion — Tochoji Temple**

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*M3KRPzGtidOcUgnakqUsZw.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*Oits0b-br0VZNNWvYGpMGw.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*jcm5LgB6T9AKJSvEVa40dw.jpeg)

On the second floor of Tochoji Temple, there is a large Buddha statue from Fukuoka that can be worshipped (50 yen).

After the worship, I had about an hour before dinner at 17:00 at Tetsunabe, so I decided to stroll around Ohori Park.

**Ohori Park**

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*uRA-JKqXFQpw535tjV1apg.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*xlCKOcGiyBpCWV45k_eyRw.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*6NPLE9ZSnrL4x9X2dWKuWg.jpeg)

Ohori Park is quite large, and it takes about 45 minutes to walk around; you can also paddle on swan boats.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*Vtj4-Jbya1Rw1HSRv6x7TA.jpeg)

The Fukuoka City Museum is closed on Mondays, so I could only view Yayoi Kusama's pumpkin from a distance.

**After walking around, it was about 17:00, time for dinner!**
#### [**Tetsunabe**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fPPCqXDa7RyBBCPa6){:target="_blank"}

I had been to Tetsunabe once before and was nostalgic for the crispy gyoza flavor.

> **_They have another branch — [Tetsunabe Hakata Gion Branch](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HPFdfeXbsbXjSNvv9){:target="_blank"} — but a few days ago, I passed by and found it closed for renovations, with a notice asking customers to go to the main store. (However, Google Maps still shows it as open)_**

> _Sauces and water are self-service._

> **_The restaurant does not support electronic payments, only cash._** _⚠️_

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*s7CJprEHxjTdoIvXV-lqFA.png)

Around 17:20, I saw people waiting outside, and soon after, the staff came out to let us in.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*64X1dLIaoS8dQ-vmnlw0yA.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*oo7G2hUaM6mSH9N2Y_EvJQ.jpeg)

This time, I knew to order two servings of gyoza; last time, the staff indicated that one serving wouldn't be enough (I didn't understand then). One serving has 8 pieces (500 yen), so I ordered two servings for 16 pieces and added a draft beer to finish this round!

The gyoza are freshly made and served sizzling hot; the skin is thin and crispy, and the filling is likely chives and pork, simple yet flavorful without being salty.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*_LncakyxVcPsfXqMUFsR4Q.png)

After finishing, I came out at 18:00 and noticed some people starting to line up.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*g9sLbyXUYXHtTdamH1Inzw.jpeg)

After eating, I walked back to the hotel, passing by the Nakasu Yatai that was being prepared. This time, I noticed many more shared bicycles.

Find the tour guide for your day trip at the plaza in front of [LAWSON (Lawson) Hakata Station Chikushiguchi Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VmGiPMRDmfNJkLSk8){:target="_blank"}. (There will be several groups at the same time, including those led by KKDAY, EasyGo, trips to Takachiho, Yufuin, etc.)

The guide (in Chinese) will have a list and will inform you of the bus number after check-in. Remember the bus number so you can board directly.

> _Seats are first come, first served. If you have special circumstances (e.g., motion sickness), you can inform the guide._

#### 08:00 AM Depart when everyone is present

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*YozsyXeU5rZbWTwI5guHag.jpeg)

- The guide introduces themselves (Shin Nan) in Chinese, English, and Japanese.
- Introduction to the itinerary; the guide mentions that the Takachiho day trip is the longest and most challenging among all day trip options XD.
- WiFi is available on the bus (though it's not very stable).
- **Always wear your seatbelt ⚠️**
- Most participants are from Taiwan.
- Introduction to Takachiho Shrine and checking if anyone has reserved a boat ride.
- It takes about 3 hours to reach the first Takachiho Shrine.

#### About Takachiho Boat Ride

> **_[The Takachiho boat ride requires a reservation three days in advance, and there are limited slots for each time period.](https://eipro.jp/takachiho1/eventCalendars/index#){:target="_blank"} ⚠️_** 

The boat ride is not long; it should take about 30–45 minutes round trip. Lunch will be finished around 12:00, and the Takachiho itinerary will conclude around 13:20, after which we will regroup to return.

Our group has three sets of people with reservations.

> **_Therefore, if you want to combine the day trip with a boat reservation, 12:00 / 12:30 would be a more suitable time._** _⚠️_ 

After lunch, we will need to walk to Takachiho Gorge. If you have a boat reservation or feel that you cannot handle the physical exertion, the guide has arranged a shuttle bus directly to save time.

> **_Ultimately, it is still based on KKDAY's arrangements. It is recommended to inquire with the official before making a reservation to ensure there are no issues._** _⚠️_ 

#### 9:20 AM Rest Stop

Due to the longer travel time, we will stop at a rest area for 10 minutes to allow everyone to use the restroom and stretch.

Slippers are required; the overall atmosphere resembles a Japanese restaurant designed for group tourists, but it was my first experience at a Japanese restaurant as well.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*I9dQyP90AN37JzP4b4kapw.jpeg)

The overall quality of the meal was below average; it might be due to the large group, as most dishes were cold, and the meat quality was just mediocre.  
#### 12:15 Start walking to Takachiho Gorge (downhill all the way)

After finishing our meal, we followed the guide on foot down to Takachiho Gorge.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*bwFjfH7v1yd_6KWT1jn7Vg.jpeg)

After about a 20-minute walk, we reached Takachiho Gorge, where we could see the end of the gorge from this angle (the boat stop).

#### 12:45 Arrive at Takachiho Gorge

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*RIiUvEzZKfTyV4lFS4dEyg.jpeg)

From the bridge at Takachiho Gorge, you can see the ancient path we just walked and the boats below.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*5aE7y8wb7lJhoyfEvXofqQ.jpeg)

The boat area is just past the bridge; the total length (to the stop we just saw) is about 250 meters.

There is a small park and shopping street where you can grab ice cream or snacks to recharge.  
#### 13:20 Regroup back at the tour bus

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*yx7-Uip2uAUTtMNgVsutsQ.jpeg)

#### Arrive at Amano Iwato Shrine West Main Hall around 13:45 (check for other itineraries during cherry blossom season)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*ErhGHlS7FgIuxcc1aW0w7A.jpeg)

After getting off the bus, we walked about 5 minutes to Amano Iwato Shrine West Main Hall, where different deity masks are hung outside the shops along the street.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*rMWzBYZ2s1WsrXOKU459Zg.png)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*mkaIVIaJ_OcKjEE8di-FpQ.jpeg)

The guide will share the story of Amaterasu, which was introduced on the bus.

**To reach Amano Tsuji, we also need to walk a short distance. The guide agreed with everyone to walk to Amano Tsuji first, and then everyone can return on their own or follow the guide back.**  
#### Around 14:00 Walk to Amano Tsuji

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*G0f_55cdcm384QPtX7w7Mg.jpeg)

The Amano Iwato Cave is where the sun goddess Amaterasu once hid; the area around the shrine's torii gate is filled with stones left by worshippers.

On the way back after the visit, we passed by an ice shop.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*HH9jCF_ytHWUOHuhtz-wIQ.jpeg)

Everyone was queuing for ice cream, and we also tried the local Miyazaki mango ice cream (900 yen). The tour guide mentioned that Miyazaki mangoes are very premium, but honestly, Taiwanese mangoes have a stronger mango flavor.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*gIyYsPe990mMQsV-IqhGng.jpeg)

After resting, we slowly walked back to worship at the Amano Iwato Shrine.  
#### Gathered for return around 15:10

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*7nttm6u86uiX8pw6en4fgg.jpeg)

After the last stop, it was already past three in the afternoon, and we were about to start our return journey (still a three-hour drive back to Fukuoka).  
#### Stopped at a rest area around 16:40

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*JRNNt_9baxeqqo6nr71EbA.jpeg)

The return trip will also stop at a rest area for everyone to use the restroom and stretch.  
#### Arrived back at Hakata Station Chikushi Exit around 18:00 (Hakata rear station)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*ol3G8YhKpOy3vErasMk3SQ.jpeg)

**The trip concluded smoothly; thank you, Shikan, for the guidance and itinerary arrangements 👏👏👏👏👏.**

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*SgqcFTk10PTTpI5g-yBvvA.jpeg)

For dinner, I casually bought a convenience store hot dog and onigiri from Tenjin Underground Street that I had eaten a few days ago on Day 6. The new grape-flavored Suntory is delicious!! I also snacked on a BRULEE.

**Good night.**  
### Day 10 **Shopping in Hakata, Shopping in Tenjin, Watching Baseball at PayPay Dome**

The sightseeing itinerary in Kyushu is coming to an end, with nearly two days left for shopping.

In the morning, we first went to Don Quijote (24 hr) for some simple shopping. The [Tenjin Main Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/o9DNmBbXiVHrsrwNA){:target="_blank"} is quite large, with several floors to explore.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*TjGAt4LgjMbMBJX-Wpv9ig.jpeg)

Around noon, we went to the Hakata Station department store to browse, buy souvenirs, Fukuoka-produced sake, Fukusaya Nagasaki cakes, and Kokura Meigetsu rice crackers, among others.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*-m2chBgx1htRbGb1GRme2A.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*quv5LL_DwolW2saqcXJ8LQ.jpeg)

In the afternoon, we returned to the Tenjin area, exploring Tenjin Underground Street, Le Labo, Iwataya Department Store, Mitsui Department Store, etc. (there are many department stores in Tenjin).

Le Labo's Another 13 had just been restocked, and this time I bought 50ml (about NT$5,800 after tax refund).

At the heavenly C-pla, I pressed an interesting bus stop button XD

Pressing it will produce sound XD.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*O43x-F_NrWlTvNDzyjYRpQ.jpeg)

Carrying my spoils back to the hotel to rest, I had a hot dog and dessert along with **a must-try in Japan! Draft Cola!**
#### **Hakata Canal City**

After a break, I headed out again and arrived at Hakata Canal City at 16:30.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*MbNV91BSfjhHZBZAj6DYeA.jpeg)

The main goal was to visit the huge capsule toy department on B1.

![[https://gofukuoka\.jp/zh\-tw/spots/detail/196050](https://gofukuoka.jp/zh-tw/spots/detail/196050){:target="_blank"}](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*eEli6XCLZzhcZKrgVTtPMA.png)

[https://gofukuoka\.jp/zh\-tw/spots/detail/196050](https://gofukuoka.jp/zh-tw/spots/detail/196050){:target="_blank"}

After browsing, I headed to Hakata Station.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*vIY0a7z6uDEXf4hFPvC-aQ.png)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*ZDW7O_JAHFjzFpe1hOUIWw.jpeg)

Around 17:30, I took a bus from Hakata Station to PayPay Dome, where I would watch a baseball game at 18:00.
#### Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks vs. Tokyo Yakult Swallows @ Fukuoka PayPay Dome

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*8VW_uw9jjAwKnCoZTS3Jjg.jpeg)

> **_Today's matchup is: Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks vs. Tokyo Yakult Swallows_**

[**Some entry regulations reminders**](https://www.softbankhawks.co.jp/global/traditional-c/){:target="_blank"} **:** You need to open your backpack for security checks, no outside food is allowed, you can bring one bottle of tea or drink, no alcohol is allowed, food and drinks are available inside, and remember to get a re-entry permit if you leave.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*eiHDBA4x_kpMGqoAb7_3rw.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*Qw426WiCNcpHd-jWmkZGCQ.jpeg)

The mascot of the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks is named Harry, so of course, I had to come and support the team.

Last time I sat in the more expensive infield home plate area, this time I thought I would just sit in the cheapest seats to experience the atmosphere. I originally thought there would be free seating, but it turned out to be all reserved seats, so I chose a spot in the last row on the outer field side for easy access (the seats in the outer field don't have backs, which makes it easier to get in and out).

I can't help but admire the atmosphere of professional sports in Japan; on a weekday at 18:00, the stadium has about 40,000 seats, almost full, and there were no empty rows or corner seats available when I was selecting my seat.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*nFna03LnvTaASCP6cZ4ZGQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*zNDWsa7yqKPxtw8J_2moDQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*uADGAQufySyoKV7XUuFPrA.jpeg)

The view and distance compared to last time were quite different.

[![Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks 7th Inning Cheer at Fukuoka PayPay Dome](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/7ac3_hqdefault.jpg "Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks 7th Inning Cheer at Fukuoka PayPay Dome")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh2B48izD0c){:target="_blank"}

This time, we fell behind significantly and ended the game with a score of 9:3. There were no fireworks to watch, but we did get to see the support activities from both teams. (The balloon support from the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks and the umbrella dance support from the Tokyo Yakult Swallows)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*7TxE9xlTKrSYpoTfvPxj2w.jpeg)

By the end of the 7th inning, the score was already 9:1, and people started leaving one after another. I didn't see the end.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*chsIAkCPRsuICAKsUToAYw.jpeg)

The bus stop was just as crowded, and like last time, I followed the crowd back to the subway station at 唐人町. (About 15 minutes)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*VELpuKAaNd51dPSi8a1Uqw.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*RVB6UIcQV20vHlYk2JHbFA.jpeg)

Before heading back to the hotel to rest, I deliberately took a last look at the night view of Fukuoka from the walkway at 中洲屋台.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*xOI_IAZ1WXE1C6PUGg0PRw.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*Yhk3N3pKZ1dXqRFwXzLx9w.jpeg)

For a late-night snack, I had Nissin Donbei tofu skin instant noodles (this was the first time I tried it during this trip), fruit wine from Oita, and convenience store fried chicken (Juicy and delicious).
### Day 11 Lalaport, 博多 Shopping, 天神 Shopping, Return Trip

Unknowingly, it has been 11 days since I went abroad, and I have started to miss Taiwanese food. There is still plenty of time to wander around before my flight at 21:00.

![[https://toyscabin\.com/product/20221201\_546\.php](https://toyscabin.com/product/20221201_546.php){:target="_blank"}](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*c2EQqSh8icbu9MvpP84C5A.jpeg)

[https://toyscabin\.com/product/20221201\_546\.php](https://toyscabin.com/product/20221201_546.php){:target="_blank"}

I have already bought and packed most of the souvenirs, so today I just wandered around looking for the capsule toy of the train departure. (In the end, I couldn't find it; refer to [the store provided by the manufacturer](https://toyscabin.com/shoplist/){:target="_blank"}, as they were sold out in the city)
#### Lalaport

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*3_jdrLurFuUfNdW4BJaRww.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*ADFlp9o6yK9xJblNn6gzYA.jpeg)

In the morning, I went to explore Lalaport since I had nothing to do. (It opens at 10 AM)

On the first floor, there was a drink cabinet converted from a Nishitetsu bus, which was very cool XD.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*NevqI_yY-IKljL9hXBjAWw.jpeg)

The main purpose was to check out the Gachapon Forest on the third floor and Pon! at the escalator on the first floor to see if they had the capsule toy I was looking for. (They didn't)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*PLxI3AUSY0-Fz84D2M1RBA.jpeg)

As it approached 11 AM and I hadn't had breakfast, I was very hungry, so I had seafood tempura rice bowl at the food court on the third floor (I found it quite salty).

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*56aWIjErjKbXiA8ChUfQQg.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*FU89tN5gnUvklsqtqH-Pcg.jpeg)

I then went back to the first floor to buy some strawberry daifuku from 如水庵 to cleanse my palate.

Not finding the capsule toy I was looking for, I left Lalaport and returned to 博多 Station, where there was also a Pon! in 1010, but they didn't have it either.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*5c_98uPDZBciyj4prH1XUw.jpeg)
```



I couldn't find the capsule toy area at Yodobashi in Hakata.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*JsVdzjBtCGztTJQG41n62A.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*F3yBg0jacGovhM3CUNAt6w.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*eGrU_n0pCPaedeWP7tSjjA.jpeg)

After failing in Hakata, I returned to the capsule toy store in the Tenjin area, but still had no luck.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*VrvDDrMB1reYSSNhNWr_4A.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*8Ws-IwDb1TrI5CScb4igKw.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*ZDyMjtfDM-T2HIBHWWrhog.jpeg)

Finally, I gave up and went to browse the Animate and Kiddy Land upstairs (which has a lot of merchandise from various IPs).

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*aHLNs3pIuKHITpWo47PeXA.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*KCCQwrUwYPt9FeQUpVJzDQ.jpeg)

Around 16:00, as my trip was coming to an end, I sat down at a Komeda's Coffee to enjoy some dessert and coffee.

At about 17:00, I returned to the hotel to pick up my luggage and slowly made my way to Fukuoka Airport. I initially thought there would be a lot of people on the subway around five in the afternoon, but it wasn't crowded at all.

Walking from Tenjin Minami to Tenjin is quite far, dragging my luggage took about 15 minutes.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*MzCBDX6cIwpnFSXvaPPwmw.png)

After taking the airport line to Fukuoka Airport Station (domestic), I still had to transfer to the airport shuttle (free) to the international terminal.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*jLbl0N2ZA8ItGyYBry4lzQ.jpeg)

The shuttle bus runs quite frequently, about every 5–10 minutes, and the journey takes about 10 minutes. After getting off, I still had to walk to the 3rd floor departure hall; conservatively estimating, it takes an additional 30 minutes from the airport line subway to actually reach the international terminal.

Fukuoka Airport is under renovation, making it quite chaotic.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*2w7WLuRfDykkMtjkj-gddQ.png)

I arrived at the airport too early; the counters weren't open yet. The ground staff directed us to first use self-check-in at counter 1 and then go to counter 2 for baggage drop-off, where they would assist us. We quickly completed the baggage check-in (this time it was only 17 kg).

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*pxbrLj_D47zHIaXwzwOEmg.png)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*Br3i8a4p5fF_Vb_DSNI7Iw.png)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*RQkyHzeRjgKJqZMfp9RaJg.jpeg)

Around 18:30, I started waiting at the gate.

The departure lounge at Fukuoka Airport is long and narrow, very crowded and chaotic. (I don't know if it's because of the ongoing renovations and too many flights waiting to take off.)

The duty-free shops for luxury goods and cosmetics are quite complete, and the staff can speak Chinese; there are also souvenir shops (including Fuku Sanya's Nagasaki cakes); there is only one duty-free shop for tobacco and alcohol that requires a queue, and the food and convenience store lines are even longer.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*_yqBTnLSHtP7HZ8wwicUzw.png)

> **_A special announcement for the previous flight CI129 at 19:10: Please comply with China Airlines' regulation of only one carry-on bag. Additional bags must be purchased (this flight seems to be fully booked).⚠️_**

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*W4rmUkYm34Sxx-4c_MadhA.png)

Feeling that it was too noisy and chaotic here, I walked towards the north side, 501–504, where there were fewer people; there was also a café and casual dining place to eat.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*wU4s-eBMyebdf6LUUcjpyA.png)

I simply bought a pork cutlet sandwich and a few cans of Coke and peach soda to take back to Taiwan.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*_wdwb02ZHXDof-LoB7a75w.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*-baTicwRl6gLL3bL5yrHvw.jpeg)

Boarding began around 20:30. There was no special check for the one carry-on bag rule on this flight (but I had already stuffed everything into one bag...), and we prepared for takeoff at 21:00, taking off at 21:09. The plane was an A330–300, which is an older model.

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*a4IBuVIKS4jR9M50W8cbZA.jpeg)

![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*UUqeTnMRqc7zTDENbH2xpA.png)



Goodbye Kyushu, goodbye Japan. The airplane meal was ginger-flavored pork stir-fried noodles, not great, but the fruit included cantaloupe!


![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*qbV0HQS1wVS6YGJYXTxluw.jpeg)


The flight encountered turbulence and was quite bumpy, but we landed in Taiwan smoothly, delayed by nearly 30 minutes, arriving close to 11 PM. (Scheduled for 10:25 PM)


![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*BHqMU4K5Nq0nu948rMn5Uw.jpeg)


Worried about missing public transport, I ran all the way. I missed the airport express but fortunately caught the bus; otherwise, I would have had to take an unsafe unlicensed taxi back to Taipei.

[**Route 1819**](https://www.taiwanbus.tw/eBUSPage/Query/QueryResult.aspx?rno=18190&rn=1679495301807&lan=C){:target="_blank"} **, my goodness, it takes about 55 minutes to get to Taipei Main Station.**


![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*6OFJNgBUCp05d6L4p_JEfw.png)



> **_The stops along the way are shown in the image above. If you need to get off midway, please inform the driver when loading your luggage; he will separate it. Otherwise, all luggage for those getting off at Taipei Main Station will be placed together, and you won't be able to retrieve your luggage if you need to get off midway.⚠️_** 




#### 6/14, a little past midnight, I returned to my warm home, concluding this 11-day journey.

I walked an average of about 20,000 steps daily, with a maximum of 27,000 steps.
### Souvenirs


![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*ckVfirr2Qe94NpTeiWjPww.png)



![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*NXPT_XmYc0Ck_8cvq4Aj1A.png)


The box on the right was missed in the photo; it contains shrimp chips that I tasted and found delicious at the department store in Hakata Station.
#### Small items collected from various places in Japan


![](/assets/cb65fd5ab770/1*uChsoNTan0z5TvqUboYyMg.jpeg)


This time, I added four deities from the Seven Lucky Gods, a mini beer, and a dog-themed good luck charm for the Year of the Dog from Takachiho.

The background newspaper was a gift from buying Le Labo.
#### Finally, thank you for reading my travel record; also, thanks to my travel companion James this time.
