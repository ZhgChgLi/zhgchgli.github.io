### Is Using Google Sites to Build a Personal Website Still Relevant?

Experience and setup guide for creating a personal website with the new Google Sites



![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*XFmZ3hHYo2X0GqM9OReN7A.png)

### Update 2022â€“07â€“17

I have currently packaged and downloaded Medium articles using my own tool, [ZMediumToMarkdown](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"}, and converted them into Markdown format for migration to Jekyll.

#### ===
### Origin

Last year, when I changed jobs, I whimsically registered a [domain](http://www.zhgchg.li){:target="_blank"} to serve as a link to my personal resume; six months later, I thought it would be more useful to provide more information, and I was also looking for a second website to back up the articles I had published on Medium, just in case.
### Desired Features
- Customizable pages
- A smooth writing interface like Medium
- Interactive features (likes/comments/following)
- Good SEO structure
- Lightweight and fast loading
- Ability to bind my own domain
- Low intrusiveness (advertisement intrusiveness, website branding)
- Easy to set up

### Website Building Options
1. **Self-hosted WordPress** 
I rented a host and domain a long time ago and used WordPress to build a personal website; after setting it up, adjusting it to my preferred layout, installing plugins, and even developing missing plugins myself, I found I had no energy left for writing, and it felt cumbersome. The loading speed and SEO were also not as good as Medium, and if I continued to spend time tweaking it, I would have even less motivation to write.
2. **Matters/JianShuâ€¦ and similar platforms** 
Similar to Medium, but since I am not considering profit, it is not suitable.
3. Wix/Weebly are too commercial, and the free version is too intrusive.
4. **Google Sites (this article)**
5. Github Pages + Jekyll
6. **Still searching &gt;&gt;&gt; Suggestions welcome**

### About Google Sites

I used the old version of Google Sites around 2010 to create a personal website -> a file download center page; my memory is a bit hazy, but I remember the layout being quite cumbersome and the interface not very user-friendly. Ten years later, I thought this service had been discontinued, but I accidentally saw a domain investor using it to create a parked page with contact information for sale:


![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*9r_pdRlseRfizfxXszwQtw.jpeg)


When I first saw it, I thought, "Wow! The visuals are nice; they actually created a page to sell the domain." Upon closer inspection of the floating label in the lower left corner, I realized, "Wow! This was actually built with Google Sites," which is worlds apart from the interface I used ten years ago. I found out that Google Sites had not been discontinued; instead, a new version was launched in 2016. Although it has been almost five years, at least the interface has kept up with the times!
### Product Showcase

Before saying anything else, letâ€™s take a look at the product I created. If you resonate with it, you might consider giving it a try!

### Why not give it a try?

To save reading time, I **will state the conclusion first; I am still looking for more suitable service options**. Although it continues to maintain and update features, Google Sites has several critical needs that are not met. Below are the fatal shortcomings I encountered while using it.
#### Fatal Shortcomings
1. **Defects in Code Highlighting Functionality**  
The feature only provides `Code Block background color gray display` without changing colors. If you want to embed Gist, you can only use Embed JavaScript (iframe), but Google Sites does not handle it specially. The height cannot change with the page scaling, resulting in either too much blank space or two scroll bars appearing on small mobile screens, which is very ugly and hard to read.
2. **SEO Structure is Essentially Zero**  
"Surprised? Unexpected?" The SEO structure of Google's own service results is as bad as ðŸ’©, not allowing any customization of head meta (description/tag/og:). Forget about SEO indexing and ranking; just posting your own website on Line/Facebook and other social media provides no preview information, only an ugly URL and website name.

![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*J3_xIg5gj218xWci44_fMg.png)

#### Advantages

**1. Low Intrusiveness, only a floating exclamation mark in the lower left corner that shows "Google Collaboration Platform Report Abuse" when clicked.**

![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*G613lcXGZJyoH_4Yh0uDVw.gif)

**2. User-friendly Interface, easily create pages by dragging components on the right.**

![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*tL8eMmBU50Ve-ReHjdlNOA.png)

Similar to wix/weebly or cakeresume? Layout configuration, just drag and fill components to complete!

**3. Supports RWD, built-in search, and navigation bar.**

**4. Supports Landing Pages.**

![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*rFFL-Z9wsj9hyTXlf12fYQ.gif)

**5. No special traffic limits, capacity according to the creator's Google Drive storage limit.**

**6.** ðŸŒŸ **Can bind your own domain.**

**7.** ðŸŒŸ **Can directly integrate GA to analyze visitors.**

**8. [Official Community](https://support.google.com/sites/threads?hl=en){:target="_blank"} collects feedback and continues to maintain updates.**

**9. Supports announcement prompts.**

![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*VSocV0KGjORCT2te5BPcdg.png)

**10.** ðŸŒŸ **Seamlessly embed YouTube, Google Forms, Google Slides, Google Docs, Google Calendar, Google Maps, and supports RWD for both computer and mobile browsing.**

**11.** ðŸŒŸ **Page content supports embedded JavaScript/HTML/CSS.**

**12. Clean and simple URLs (http://example.com/page-name/sub-page-name), customizable page path names.**
```

```markdown
**13\.** ðŸŒŸ **Page layout has reference lines/auto-alignment, very thoughtful**

### Applicable Websites

I think Google Sites is only suitable for very lightweight web services, such as school clubs, small event pages, and personal resumes.
### Some Setting Tutorials

Listing some issues I encountered and solved while using it; the rest are WYSIWYG operations, not much to document.

> _However, as mentioned in the aforementioned critical flaw, embedding an iframe cannot respond to height according to the webpage size._ 





**How to Insert?**


![Select "Embed"](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*DNUUlzli89PNnVr519tJww.png)

Select "Embed"


![Select Embed Code](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*HQjsXL1VpMkA3OLDiAgNFA.png)

Select Embed Code

You can input JavaScript/HTML/CSS, which can be used to create custom styled Button UI.


> **_Additionally, selecting "Image" allows you to insert multiple images, which will be presented in a waterfall layout (as shown in my [Corner of the City](https://www.zhgchg.li/photo){:target="_blank"} page)._** 




#### Can't fill out embedded Google Forms directly on the page?

This is because the form contains a " **File Upload** " item, [which cannot be embedded in other pages due to browser security issues](https://support.google.com/sites/thread/24853300?hl=en){:target="_blank"}; thus, it will only display the questionnaire information and require clicking the fill-out button to open a new window for content submission.

The only solution is to remove the file upload issue, allowing direct filling on the page.
### **Button component URL content cannot input anchor points**

EX: \#lifesection, I want to place it at the top of the page for directory indexing or at the bottom for a GoTop button.

I checked with the official community, and currently, it is not possible. The button links can only 1. open external links in a new window or 2. specify internal pages, so I later used subpages to split the directory.
