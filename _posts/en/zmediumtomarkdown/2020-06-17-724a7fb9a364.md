### Is Using Google Sites to Build a Personal Website Still Relevant Today?

New Google Site Personal Website Creation Experience and Setup Guide

### Update 2022â€“07â€“17

I have used my own tool, [ZMediumToMarkdown](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"}, to download and convert Medium articles into Markdown format for migration to Jekyll.

### Origin

When I changed jobs last year, I somewhat frivolously registered a [domain](http://www.zhgchg.li){:target="_blank"} to serve as a personal resume link. After six months, I thought of making the domain more useful by adding more information. At the same time, I was looking for a second website to back up the articles I published on Medium, just in case.

### Expected Features

- Is there a custom page available?

- A smooth writing interface like Medium

- Interactive features (Like/Comment/Follow)

- Good SEO structure

- Lightweight and fast loading

- Can bind your own domain

- Low intrusiveness (Ad intrusiveness, website labeling)

- Easy to build

### Hosting Options

1. **Self-Hosted WordPress**  
   A long time ago, I rented hosting and a domain to set up a personal website using WordPress. After setting it up, customizing the layout to my liking, installing plugins, and even developing missing plugins myself, I lost the motivation to write. It felt bulky, and the loading speed and SEO were not as good as Medium. Spending more time tweaking it would only drain my energy for writing even further.

2. **Matters/ç®€ä¹¦â€¦ etc.**  
   Similar to the Medium platform, but since I don't consider profitability, it's not suitable.

3. wix/weebly are too focused on business websites, and their free versions are too intrusive.

4. **Google Site (This Article)**

5. Github Pages + Jekyll

6. **Still looking >>> Suggestions are welcome**

### About Google Site

Around 2010, I used the old version of Google Sites to create a personal website -> a file download center page. My memory is a bit vague, but I only remember the layout was bulky and the interface was not smooth. After 10 years, I thought the service had been discontinued, but I accidentally saw some domain investors using it as a domain parking page with contact info for sale:

![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*9r_pdRlseRfizfxXszwQtw.jpeg)

At first glance, I thought, "Wow! The visuals are nice, they even made a page just to sell a domain." Looking closer at the bottom left corner's watermark, I realized, "Wow! This was built with Google Sites," which is completely different from the interface I used 10 years ago. After checking, I found out Google Sites hasn't stopped service; instead, it launched a new version in 2016. Although it's been almost five years, at least the interface is now modern!

### Finished Product Display

Don't say anything yet, first check out the final product I made. If you also have a "kindred spirit," you might want to give it a try!

### Why not give it a try?

To save reading time, **here is my conclusion first; I am still looking for a better service option**. Although it is continuously maintained and updated, Google Site fails to meet several key needs for me. Below are the critical drawbacks I encountered while using it.

#### Fatal Flaws

1. **Code Highlighting Limitations**  
   The feature only provides a gray background for code blocks without color syntax highlighting. To embed a Gist, you must use Embed JavaScript (iframe), but Google Site does not handle this well. The height cannot adjust with page scaling, resulting in either excessive blank space or dual scroll bars on small mobile screens, which looks ugly and is hard to read.

2. **SEO structure is basically zero**  
   "Surprised or not?" Google's own service results have terrible SEO structure, offering no customization for head meta (description/tag/og:). Forget about SEO ranking; just sharing the site on Line/Facebook shows no preview info, only an ugly URL and site name.

![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*J3_xIg5gj218xWci44_fMg.png)

#### Advantages

**1. Low invasiveness, only a floating exclamation mark appears at the bottom left, and clicking it will display "Google Workspace Report Abuse"**

![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*G613lcXGZJyoH_4Yh0uDVw.gif)

**2. Easy Interface: Quickly Build Pages by Dragging Components on the Right**

![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*tL8eMmBU50Ve-ReHjdlNOA.png)

Similar to wix/weebly or cakeresume? Layout and components are just dragged and filled to complete!

**3. Support RWD, Built-in Search, Navigation Bar**

**4. Support for Landing Page**

![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*rFFL-Z9wsj9hyTXlf12fYQ.gif)

**5. No special traffic limits; storage capacity depends on the creator's Google Drive quota**

**6.** ðŸŒŸ **Custom Domain Binding Available**

**7.** ðŸŒŸ **Direct Integration with GA for Visitor Analysis**

**8. [Official Community](https://support.google.com/sites/threads?hl=en){:target="_blank"} collects feedback and continuously maintains updates**

**9. Support Announcement Alerts**

![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*VSocV0KGjORCT2te5BPcdg.png)

**10.** ðŸŒŸ **Seamlessly embed Youtube, Google Forms, Google Slides, Google Docs, Google Calendar, Google Maps, with support for responsive design on both desktop and mobile**

**11.** ðŸŒŸ **Page content supports embedded JavaScript/Html/CSS**

**12. Clean and simple URLs (http://example.com/page-name/subpage-name), customizable page path names**

**13.** ðŸŒŸ **Page layout has guidelines/auto-alignment, very thoughtful**

![Reference alignment lines appear when dragging component positions](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*vu9BSD0zxB8O2-BGG_Ir2A.png)

Dragging a component shows alignment guide lines

### Applicable Websites

I think Google Site is only suitable for very lightweight web services, such as school clubs, small event pages, or personal resumes.

### Some Setup Instructions

List some problems you encountered and solved during use; everything else is straightforward and doesn't need to be documented.

#### Embedding Javascript/HTML/CSS, Large Number of Images

![Example of Gist](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*2uXbsl-GrC31C2vbktKbkg.png)

Example of Gist

> *However, as mentioned in the fatal flaw above, embedding an iframe cannot adjust its height responsively according to the webpage size.*

**How to Insert?**

![Select "Inline"](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*DNUUlzli89PNnVr519tJww.png)

Choose "Embed"

![Choose Embed Code](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*HQjsXL1VpMkA3OLDiAgNFA.png)

Choose Embed Code

Allows input of JavaScript/HTML/CSS, which can be used to create custom styled Button UI.

> ***Alternatively, selecting "Image" allows inserting multiple pictures, which will be displayed in a waterfall layout (like my [City Corner](https://www.zhgchg.li/photo){:target="_blank"} page above).***

#### Embedded Google Forms cannot be filled out directly on the page?

The reason is that the form includes a "**File Upload**" field, which [cannot be embedded in other pages using an iframe due to browser security restrictions](https://support.google.com/sites/thread/24853300?hl=en){:target="_blank"}; therefore, only the survey information is displayed, and users must click the fill button to open a new window to complete the form.

The solution is simply to remove the file upload issue, allowing direct input on the page.

### **Button Component URL Content Cannot Include Anchors**

EX: #lifesection, I want to place it at the top of the page as a table of contents or at the bottom as a GoTop button.

Checked the official community, currently itâ€™s not possible. The button link can only 1. open an external link in a new window or 2. specify an internal page. So I ended up splitting the menu using subpages.
