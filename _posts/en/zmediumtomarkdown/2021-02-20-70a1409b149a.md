### Origin

I have always had a habit of using Python to create small tools; some are serious, like automatically scraping data and generating reports for work, while others are less serious, such as scheduling automatic checks for desired information or delegating tasks that I would normally perform manually to a script.

For a long time, I have been quite brute-force about automation, simply running a Python script on a computer. The advantage is that it is simple and convenient, but the downside is that it requires a device connected to the internet and power. Even a Raspberry Pi consumes a small amount of electricity and internet costs, and it cannot be remotely controlled to start or stop (it can be done, but it's cumbersome). This time, taking advantage of a break at work, I researched free and cloud-based methods.
### Goal

> To run Python scripts in the cloud, execute them automatically on a schedule, and be able to start/stop them via the internet.

> _This article uses my clever trick to write an automatic check-in script for a check-in reward app, allowing me to check in daily without having to open the app; it will also send me a notification after execution._

![Completion Notification!](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*14yKaOt2YNSMILOD_EoXLg.png)

Completion Notification!
#### Chapter Order
1. Using Proxyman for Man-in-the-Middle API sniffing
2. Writing a Python script to spoof the app's API request (simulating the check-in action)
3. Moving the Python script to Google Cloud
4. Setting up automatic scheduling in Google Cloud

- Due to the sensitivity of the topic, this article will not disclose which check-in reward app is used; readers can extend this knowledge to their own use.
- **If you only want to understand how to automate execution with Python, you can skip the first half about Man-in-the-Middle API sniffing and start from Chapter 3.**

#### Tools Used
- **Proxyman**: Man-in-the-Middle API sniffing
- **Python**: Writing scripts
- **Linebot**: Sending notifications of script execution results to myself
- **Google Cloud Function**: Hosting service for Python scripts
- **Google Cloud Scheduler**: Automatic scheduling service

### 1\. Using Proxyman for Man-in-the-Middle API Sniffing

Previously, I wrote an article titled "[Even with HTTPS transmission, data can still be stolen.](../46410aaada00/)" with a similar principle, but this time I used Proxyman instead of mitmproxy; it's also free but more user-friendly.
- Download the Proxyman tool from the official website [https://proxyman\.io/](https://proxyman.io/){:target="_blank"}.
- After downloading, launch Proxyman and install the Root certificate (to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks and unpack HTTPS traffic content).

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*jb-FAN5h1oFVFFvu1bpYgw.png)

"Certificate" -> "Install Certificate On this Mac" -> "Installed & Trusted"

**After installing the Root certificate on the computer, switch to the phone:**

"Certificate" -> "Install Certificate On iOS" -> "Physical Devices…"

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*DBi9YVmfoaPH9WSCoPXycA.png)

Follow the instructions to set up the proxy on your phone and complete the certificate installation and activation.
- Open the app you want to sniff API transmission content on your phone.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*q2wbmQ3MJ6nYfjFSBHL9fw.png)

At this point, Proxyman on the Mac will display the sniffed traffic. Click on the device IP to view the app's API domain; the first time you check, you need to click "Enable only this domain" so that subsequent traffic can be unpacked.

**After clicking "Enable only this domain," you will see the intercepted traffic with the original Request and Response information:**

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*dIp1k-0u-BhJ7iTs0wEIuA.png)

> _We use this method to sniff which API endpoint is called and what data is sent when checking in on the app, recording this information to simulate requests directly with Python later._

> _⚠️ Note that some app token information may change, causing Python's simulated requests to fail in the future; you need to understand how the app token exchange works._

> _⚠️ If you confirm that Proxyman is functioning normally but the app cannot make requests while Proxyman is running, it indicates that the app may have implemented SSL Pinning; currently, there is no solution, and you will have to abandon it._

> _⚠️ App developers who want to know how to prevent sniffing can refer to [the previous article](../46410aaada00/)._

#### **Assuming we obtained the following information:**
```
POST /usercenter HTTP/1.1
Host: zhgchg.li
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Cookie: PHPSESSID=dafd27784f94904dd586d4ca19d8ae62
Connection: keep-alive
Accept: */*
User-Agent: (iPhone12,3;iOS 14.5)
Content-Length: 1076
Accept-Language: zh-tw
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
AuthToken: 12345
```
### 2\. Writing a Python Script to Spoof the App's API Request (Simulating the Check-in Action)

> _Before writing the Python script, we can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/){:target="_blank"} to debug the parameters and observe which parameters are necessary or may change over time; however, you can also directly copy them._

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*eVF56j1oOgXeZYbkD1m22g.png)

checkIn\.py:
```python
import requests
import json

def main(args):
    results = {}
    try:
      data = { "action" : "checkIn" }
      headers = { "Cookie" : "PHPSESSID=dafd27784f94904dd586d4ca19d8ae62", 
      "AuthToken" : "12345",
      "User-Agent" : "(iPhone12,3;iOS 14.5)"
      }
      
      request = requests.post('https://zhgchg.li/usercenter', data = data, headers = headers)
      result = json.loads(request.content)
      if result['status_code'] == 200:
        return "CheckIn Success!"
      else:
        return result['message']
    except Exception as e:
      return str(e)
```

> _⚠️ The `main(args)` here will be explained later; if you want to test locally, just call `main(True)`. _

Using the Requests library to execute the HTTP Request, if you encounter:
```
ImportError: No module named requests
```
Please install the package first using `pip install requests`.
#### Adding Linebot Notification for Execution Results:

This part is quite simple; I only reference it to notify myself.
- Go to & enable [**Line Developers Console**](https://developers.line.biz/console/){:target="_blank"}.
- Create a Provider.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*XVYHKZXoHT-2qkbwRcK5Qw.png)

- Select "Create a Messaging API channel."

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*8l_awW31J7FlYh5EvacSmA.png)

Fill in the basic information and click "Create" to submit.
- After creation, find the "Your user ID" section under the first "Basic settings" tab; this is your User ID.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*JCmFicC5gXVJ6j3Vgi7CPQ.png)

- After creation, select the "Messaging API" tab, scan the QR code to add the bot as a friend.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*dOF0mHXz6z7be13zjIubTA.png)

- Scroll down to find the "Channel access token" section, click "Issue" to generate the token.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*eNiyLol6nokoOKsrGp21kw.png)

- Copy the generated token; with this token, we can send messages to users.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*LDr_vT4urUL73Z_p--yiKA.png)

> _With the User ID and Token, we can send messages to ourselves._

> _Since there are no other functions to implement, I didn't even install the Python Line SDK; I just send HTTP requests directly._

**After integrating with the previous Python script…**

checkIn\.py:
```python
import requests
import json

def main(args):
    results = {}
    try:
      data = { "action" : "checkIn" }
      headers = { "Cookie" : "PHPSESSID=dafd27784f94904dd586d4ca19d8ae62", 
      "AuthToken" : "12345",
      "User-Agent" : "(iPhone12,3;iOS 14.5)"
      }
      
      request = requests.post('https://zhgchg.li/usercenter', data = data, headers = headers)
      result = json.loads(request.content)
      if result['status_code'] == 200:
        sendLineNotification("CheckIn Success!")
        return "CheckIn Success!"
      else:
        sendLineNotification(result['message'])
        return result['message']
    except Exception as e:
      sendLineNotification(str(e))
      return str(e)
      
def sendLineNotification(message):
    data = {
        "to" : "Insert your User ID here",
        "messages" : [
            {
                "type" : "text",
                "text" : message
            }
        ]
    }
    headers = {
        "Content-Type" : "application/json",
        "Authorization" : "Insert your channel access token here"
    }
    request = requests.post('https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/push', json=data, headers=headers)
```

**Let's test to see if the notification was sent successfully:**

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*7I7FMpQ-Gv5MKD0SWkIE0A.png)

**Success!**

> _As a side note, I initially intended to use Gmail SMTP to send notifications via email, but after deploying to Google Cloud, I found it was not possible…_

### 3\. Moving the Python Script to Google Cloud

Having covered the basics, we now enter the main event of this article: moving the Python script to the cloud.

Initially, I considered using Google Cloud Run, but found it too complex for my needs, which are minimal and do not require so many features; therefore, **I opted for Google Cloud Function**, a serverless solution that is commonly used to build serverless web services.
- If you have never used Google Cloud before, please go to the [**Console**](https://console.cloud.google.com/){:target="_blank"} to create a new project and set up billing information.
- On the project console homepage, click "Cloud Functions" under resources.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*pWDK9AQKpbDpgDltFfS9-g.png)

- At the top, select "Create Function."

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*ED2WPgfaSHEth3zWUJn05w.png)

- Enter the basic information.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*oetW_iIU9XywDbLZIa8tJQ.png)

> _⚠️ Remember to note the " **Trigger URL**"._

**Available regions:**
- `US-WEST1`, `US-CENTRAL1`, `US-EAST1` can enjoy free quotas for Cloud Storage services.
- `asia-east2` (Hong Kong) is closer to us but incurs a small Cloud Storage fee.

> _⚠️ When creating Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage will be needed to host the code._

> _⚠️ For detailed pricing, please refer to the end of the article._

**Trigger condition selected:** HTTP

**Authentication:** Depending on your needs, I want to be able to execute the script from an external link, so I chose "Allow unauthenticated invocations"; if you choose to require authentication, the subsequent Scheduler service will also need corresponding settings.

**Variables, network, and advanced settings can be set in the variables section for Python to use (this way, if parameters change, you won't need to modify the Python code):**

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*qJC7rcjOnSeKWa8NiYxbpQ.png)

**The way to call in Python:**
```python
import os

def main(request):
  return os.environ.get('test', 'DEFAULT VALUE')
```

No other settings are needed; just click "Save" -> "Next."
- Select the runtime as "Python 3.x" and paste the written Python script, changing the entry point to "main."

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*zCK21j82QwsHD1nARuZkBw.png)

**Supplementing main\(args\)**, as mentioned earlier, this service is more for serverless web; thus, args is actually the Request object, from which you can obtain HTTP GET query and HTTP POST body data, as follows:
```
Get GET Query information:
request_args = args.args
```

Example: ?name=zhgchgli => request_args = [“name”:”zhgchgli”]
```
Get POST Body data:
request_json = request.get_json(silent=True)
```

Example: name=zhgchgli => request_json = [“name”:”zhgchgli”]

**If testing POST with Postman, remember to use "Raw+JSON" for POST data; otherwise, there will be nothing:**

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*jl5joofEWPMLR3JuP988BQ.png)

- After confirming the code is okay, switch to "requirements.txt" and input the necessary package dependencies:

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*2MTOKWDWlXbfjYP1qgp7Sw.png)

We use the "requests" package to help us call the API, which is not included in the native Python library; therefore, we need to add it here:
```
requests>=2.25.1
```

Here, I specify the version ≥ 2.25.1, but you can also leave it unspecified to install the latest version.
- Once everything is okay, click "Deploy" to start the deployment.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*eQvtozhghRLQhxUgE9fMhw.png)

It will take about 1-3 minutes for the deployment to complete.
- After deployment, you can execute it by visiting the " **Trigger URL** " noted earlier to check if it runs correctly, or use "Actions" -> "Test Function" to perform a test.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*yv1wMHELWSrXiEvE44c9Sw.png)

If you see `500 Internal Server Error`, it means there is an error in the program. You can click the name to view the "Logs" and find the reason:

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*DeiRZT3wC1Z7Jv4WIRaM_Q.png)

```
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'db' referenced before assignment
```
- After clicking the name, you can also click "Edit" to modify the script content.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*KqwYbY826bdVaSIlHUnpbA.png)

> **_If testing goes well, you are done! We have successfully moved the Python script to the cloud._**

#### Supplement on Variables

According to our needs, we need a place to store and read the token for the check-in app; since the token may expire, we need to request it again and write it for use in the next execution.

To dynamically pass variables into the script from external sources, there are the following methods:
- \[Read Only\] The environment variables mentioned earlier.
- \[Temp\] Cloud Functions provides a /tmp directory for writing and reading files during execution, but it will be deleted afterward. For details, please refer to the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/exec#file_system){:target="_blank"}.
- \[Read Only\] Sending data via GET/POST.
- \[Read Only\] Including additional files.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*AAXUcDRZNnRAqIFj02RnyA.png)

```markdown
In the program, using the relative path `./` allows for reading, **but only for reading and not for dynamic modification**; to make changes, you can only do so in the console and redeploy.

> _If you want to read and dynamically modify, you need to connect to other GCP services, such as: Cloud SQL, Google Storage, Firebase Cloud Firestore…_

- \[Read & Write\] Here, I chose Firebase Cloud _Firestore_ because currently, this option has a free quota available.

**According to the [Getting Started Steps](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#read_data){:target="_blank"}, after setting up the Firebase project; enter the Firebase backend:**

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*0DO31noJ4a3xweb1annbSQ.png)

In the left menu, find “ **Cloud Firestore** ” -> “ **Add Collection** ”

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*7c9sA8ZbxE6uGh6f-nfiVA.png)

Enter the collection ID.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*wcp94_25maNL9EoFJTOndA.png)

Enter the data content.

A collection can have multiple documents, and each document can have its own field content; it is very flexible to use.

**Using in Python:**

First, go to [GCP Console -> IAM & Admin -> Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts){:target="_blank"}, and follow these steps to download the authentication private key file:

First, select the account:

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*JeB9m4BWzfRCZSofHq2tLg.png)

At the bottom, “Add Key” -> “Create New Key”

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*xi9nQUy48-QlFI4BEdIMew.png)

Select “JSON” to download the file.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*bsphvdEHgg0XDnHAHMXJvg.png)

Place this JSON file in the same project directory as Python.

**In the local development environment:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade firebase-admin
```

Install the firebase-admin package.

In Cloud Functions, you need to add `firebase-admin` to `requirements.txt`.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*d67oTblFFKaBHkGC77Mapw.png)

Once the environment is set up, you can read the data we just added:

firebase_admin.py:
```python
import firebase_admin
from firebase_admin import credentials
from firebase_admin import firestore

if not firebase_admin._apps:
  cred = credentials.Certificate('./authentication.json')
  firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred)
# If you initialize_app again, it will report the following error
# providing an app name as the second argument. In most cases you only need to call initialize_app() once. But if you do want to initialize multiple apps, pass a second argument to initialize_app() to give each app a unique name.
# So for safety, check if it has already been initialized before calling initialize_app

db = firestore.client()
ref = db.collection(u'example') // Collection name
stream = ref.stream()
for data in stream:
  print("id:"+data.id+","+data.to_dict())
```

> _If you are on Cloud Functions, in addition to uploading the authentication JSON file, you can also change the connection syntax to use the following:_

```python
cred = credentials.ApplicationDefault()
firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred, {
  'projectId': project_id,
})

db = firestore.client()
```

> _If you see `Failed to initialize a certificate credential.`, please check if the authentication JSON is correct._

For more operations like adding and deleting, please refer to the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data){:target="_blank"}.
### 4\. Setting Up Automatic Scheduling in Google Cloud

After having the script, the next step is to make it run automatically to achieve our ultimate goal.
- Go to the [**Google Cloud Scheduler**](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudscheduler/){:target="_blank"} console homepage
- Click “Create Job” at the top

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*5tNybi2HssmWoyJDQyPSJQ.png)

- Enter the basic job information

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*yqkJnt9PVYEllOpDtK1RmQ.png)

**Execution Frequency:** Use the same input format as crontab; if you are not familiar with crontab syntax, you can directly use [**crontab.guru, this amazing website**](https://crontab.guru/#15_1_*_*_*){:target="_blank"}:

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*xnZBlcsMrQVJc6ewJIfAxA.png)

It can clearly translate the actual meaning of the syntax you set. (Click **next** to see the next execution time)

> _Here, I set `15 1 * * *`, because the check-in only needs to run once a day, scheduled to run at 1:15 AM daily._

**URL part:** Enter the “ **trigger URL** ” you noted earlier.

**Timezone:** Enter “Taiwan”, select Taipei Standard Time.

**HTTP Method:** According to the previous Python code, we can just use Get.

**If you set “authentication” earlier**, remember to expand “SHOW MORE” for authentication settings.

**Once everything is filled out**, click “ **Create** ”.
- After successful creation, you can choose “Run Now” to test if it works correctly.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*H_nsZNQ16iIKwThQpGJDmA.png)

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*X6pL0J4hGL_KodhsppvsJg.png)

- You can check the execution results and the last execution date

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*pUqTo-NM1z-srXbq1BM4rA.png)

> _⚠️ **Please note, the execution result “failed” only refers to web status codes between 400-500 or errors in the Python program.**_

### Mission Accomplished!

We have achieved the goal of uploading the routine task Python script to the cloud and setting up automatic scheduling for it to run automatically.
### Pricing Method

Another important part is the pricing method; Google Cloud and Linebot are not entirely free services, so understanding the charging method is crucial; otherwise, it would be better to run a small script on a computer than to incur excessive costs.
#### Linebot

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*cfuKJxNoW4tvCEhqdC7oIQ.png)

Refer to the [official pricing](https://tw.linebiz.com/service/account-solutions/line-official-account/){:target="_blank"} information, where the first 500 messages per month are free.
#### Google Cloud Functions

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*2431d2F1BNtEJUg845uDQg.png)

Refer to the [official pricing](https://cloud.google.com/functions/pricing?hl=zh-tw){:target="_blank"} information, which includes 2 million invocations per month, 400,000 GB-seconds, and 200,000 GHz-seconds of compute time, along with 5 GB of internet egress traffic.
#### Google Firebase Cloud Firestore

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*2t1boe9DQX1NBgGyYTrVnA.png)

Refer to the [official pricing](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quotas){:target="_blank"} information, which includes 1 GB of storage, 10 GB of traffic per month, 50,000 reads, and 20,000 writes/deletes per day; light usage is more than sufficient!
#### Google Cloud Scheduler

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*b9cvGpPqjKRFHa-45Yuzdw.png)

Refer to the [official pricing](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/pricing?hl=zh-tw){:target="_blank"} information, where each account can set up 3 free jobs.

> For the script, the above free usage is more than enough!

#### Google Cloud Storage Conditional Free Usage

Despite trying to avoid it, there are still services that may incur charges.

Once Cloud Functions are set up, two Cloud Storage instances will be automatically created:

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*OvWXsZbwnM8sNfvdtDAIOA.png)

If you selected US-WEST1, US-CENTRAL1, or US-EAST1 for Cloud Functions, you can enjoy free usage quotas:

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*arevMQGpsIumGlw_PE-hQQ.png)

I chose US-CENTRAL1, and indeed, the first Cloud Storage instance is in US-CENTRAL1, but the second one is labeled **multiple regions in the US**; **I estimate that this will incur charges**.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*kuX9HlPTfMxbEg-sa3rJOQ.png)

Refer to the [official pricing](https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing?hl=zh-tw){:target="_blank"} information, which varies in price depending on the hosting region.

The code is not large, and I estimate it should incur a minimum charge of 0.0X0 per month (?)

> _⚠️ The above information was recorded as of 2021/02/21, and the actual prices should be based on current rates, provided for reference only._

#### Budget Control Notifications

Just in case… if there is a situation where the free usage exceeds and charges begin, I hope to receive notifications; to avoid being unaware of a bill due to potential program errors.
- Go to the [**Console**](https://console.cloud.google.com/){:target="_blank"}
- Find the “ **Billing** ” card:

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*r0T8gZsaWroxhWxIxKwRWQ.png)

Click “ **View Detailed Billing History** ” to enter.
- Expand the left menu and go to the “ **Budgets & Alerts** ” feature

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*GtT4Sj9Q19O_QxWTWgM5UA.png)

- Click “ **Create Budget** ” at the top

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*ytmGKw4sy6b-U3XAeI_geQ.png)

- Enter a custom name

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*_qgQMB_WsCuoxtJ4vA6xgw.png)

Next step.
- Amount, enter the “ **Target Amount** ”, you can enter $1, $10; we don’t want to spend too much on small things.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*y6fIpzReQxZZRsVpZIk-tw.png)

Next step.

In the actions section, you can set when the budget reaches a certain percentage to trigger notifications.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*y4B62yjPWAy1pBQhZmiySQ.png)

**Check** “ **Send alerts via email to billing administrators and users** ”, so that when the conditions are met, you can receive notifications immediately.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*PTQDG_Uffa8fvHxaeYCnrQ.png)
