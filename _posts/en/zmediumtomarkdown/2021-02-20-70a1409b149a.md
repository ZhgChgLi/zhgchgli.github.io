### Origin

I have always had the habit of using Python to create small tools; some are serious, like automatically scraping data and generating reports for work, while others are less serious, scheduling automatic checks for desired information or delegating tasks that were originally done manually to scripts.

For a long time, I have been quite brute-force about "automation," simply running a Python script on a computer and letting it run; the advantage is simplicity and convenience, while the downside is that it requires a device connected to the internet and power. Even a Raspberry Pi consumes a small amount of electricity and internet costs, and it cannot be remotely controlled to start or stop (it can be done, but it's cumbersome). This time, taking advantage of a break at work, I researched free and cloud-based methods.
### Goal


> To run Python scripts in the cloud, execute them automatically on a schedule, and be able to turn them on/off via the internet. 





> _This article uses my clever tricks to write a script that automatically completes check-ins for a check-in reward app, allowing me to check in daily without having to open the app; it also sends me a notification upon completion._ 






![Completion Notification!](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*14yKaOt2YNSMILOD_EoXLg.png)

Completion Notification!
#### Chapter Order
1. Using Proxyman for Man in the Middle Attack API Sniffing
2. Writing a Python script to spoof the app's API request (simulating the check-in action)
3. Moving the Python script to Google Cloud
4. Setting up automatic scheduling in Google Cloud

- Due to the sensitivity of the subject, this article will not disclose which check-in reward app is involved; readers can extend and use it themselves.
- **If you only want to understand how to automate execution with Python, you can skip the first half about Man in the Middle Attack API sniffing and start from Chapter 3.** 

#### Tools Used
- **Proxyman**: Man in the Middle Attack API Sniffing
- **Python**: Writing scripts
- **Linebot**: Sending notifications of script execution results to myself
- **Google Cloud Function**: Hosting service for Python scripts
- **Google Cloud Scheduler**: Automatic scheduling service

### 1. Using Proxyman for Man in the Middle Attack API Sniffing

Previously, I published an article titled "[The app uses HTTPS for transmission, but the data was still stolen.](../46410aaada00/)" with a similar principle; however, this time I used Proxyman instead of mitmproxy. It's also free but more user-friendly.
- Download the Proxyman tool from the official website [https://proxyman\.io/](https://proxyman.io/){:target="_blank"}
- After downloading, launch Proxyman and install the Root certificate (to perform the Man in the Middle Attack and unpack the HTTPS traffic content)

```markdown
![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*jb-FAN5h1oFVFFvu1bpYgw.png)

"Certificate" -> "Install Certificate On this Mac" -> "Installed & Trusted"

**After installing the Root certificate on the computer, switch to the phone:**

"Certificate" -> "Install Certificate On iOS" -> "Physical Devices…"

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*DBi9YVmfoaPH9WSCoPXycA.png)

Follow the instructions to set up the Proxy on the phone and complete the certificate installation and activation.
- Open the APP on the phone that you want to sniff the API transmission content from.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*q2wbmQ3MJ6nYfjFSBHL9fw.png)

At this point, Proxyman on the Mac will display the sniffed traffic. Click on the device IP under the APP API domain you want to view; the first time you check, you need to click "Enable only this domain" so that subsequent traffic can be unpacked.

**After "Enable only this domain," you will see the newly intercepted traffic showing the original Request and Response information:**

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*dIp1k-0u-BhJ7iTs0wEIuA.png)

> _We used this method to sniff which API EndPoint was called and what data was sent during the check-in operation on the APP, recording this information to later simulate the request directly using Python._

> _⚠️ Note that some APP token information may change, causing future Python simulated requests to fail. It's important to understand how APP token exchanges work._

> _⚠️ If you confirm that Proxyman is functioning normally, but the APP cannot make requests while Proxyman is running, it indicates that the APP may have implemented SSL Pinning; currently, there is no solution, and you can only abandon it._

> _⚠️ APP developers who want to know how to prevent sniffing can refer to [the previous article](../46410aaada00/)._

#### **Assuming the information we obtained is as follows:**
```
POST /usercenter HTTP/1.1
Host: zhgchg.li
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Cookie: PHPSESSID=dafd27784f94904dd586d4ca19d8ae62
Connection: keep-alive
Accept: */*
User-Agent: (iPhone12,3;iOS 14.5)
Content-Length: 1076
Accept-Language: zh-tw
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
AuthToken: 12345
```
### 2. Write a Python script to forge APP API requests (simulate check-in action)

> _Before writing the Python script, we can first use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/){:target="_blank"} to debug the parameters and observe which parameters are necessary or may change over time; but it's also fine to copy them directly._

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*eVF56j1oOgXeZYbkD1m22g.png)

checkIn.py:
```python
import requests
import json

def main(args):
    results = {}
    try:
      data = { "action" : "checkIn" }
      headers = { "Cookie" : "PHPSESSID=dafd27784f94904dd586d4ca19d8ae62", 
      "AuthToken" : "12345",
      "User-Agent" : "(iPhone12,3;iOS 14.5)"
      }
      
      request = requests.post('https://zhgchg.li/usercenter', data = data, headers = headers)
      result = json.loads(request.content)
      if result['status_code'] == 200:
        return "CheckIn Success!"
      else:
        return result['message']
    except Exception as e:
      return str(e)
```
```

> _⚠️ `main(args)` The purpose of args will be explained later. If you want to test locally, just use `main(True)`._

Using the Requests library to execute HTTP Requests. If you see:
```
ImportError: No module named requests
```

Please install the library first using `pip install requests`.
#### Adding Execution Result Linebot Notification:

This part is very simple; it's just a reference and only notifies myself.
- Go to & enable [**Line Developers Console**](https://developers.line.biz/console/){:target="_blank"}
- Create a Provider

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*XVYHKZXoHT-2qkbwRcK5Qw.png)

- Select "Create a Messaging API channel"

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*8l_awW31J7FlYh5EvacSmA.png)

After filling in the basic information, click "Create" to submit.
- After creation, find the "Your user ID" section under the first "Basic settings" Tab; this is your User ID.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*JCmFicC5gXVJ6j3Vgi7CPQ.png)

- After creation, select the "Messaging API" Tab, scan the QR code to add the bot as a friend.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*dOF0mHXz6z7be13zjIubTA.png)

- Continue scrolling down to find the "Channel access token" section, click "Issue" to generate the token.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*eNiyLol6nokoOKsrGp21kw.png)

- Copy the generated Token; with this Token, we can send messages to users.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*LDr_vT4urUL73Z_p--yiKA.png)

> _With the User Id and Token, we can send messages to ourselves._

> _Since there are no other functions to implement, there's no need to install the Python line SDK; we can just send HTTP requests directly._

**After integrating with the previous Python script…**

checkIn\.py:
```python
import requests
import json

def main(args):
    results = {}
    try:
      data = { "action" : "checkIn" }
      headers = { "Cookie" : "PHPSESSID=dafd27784f94904dd586d4ca19d8ae62", 
      "AuthToken" : "12345",
      "User-Agent" : "(iPhone12,3;iOS 14.5)"
      }
      
      request = requests.post('https://zhgchg.li/usercenter', data = data, headers = headers)
      result = json.loads(request.content)
      if result['status_code'] == 200:
        sendLineNotification("CheckIn Success!")
        return "CheckIn Success!"
      else:
        sendLineNotification(result['message'])
        return result['message']
    except Exception as e:
      sendLineNotification(str(e))
      return str(e)
      
def sendLineNotification(message):
    data = {
        "to" : "Put your User ID here",
        "messages" : [
            {
                "type" : "text",
                "text" : message
            }
        ]
    }
    headers = {
        "Content-Type" : "application/json",
        "Authorization" : "Put channel access token here"
    }
    request = requests.post('https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/push',json = data, headers = headers)
```

```markdown
**Check if the notification was sent successfully:**


![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*7I7FMpQ-Gv5MKD0SWkIE0A.png)


**Success!**


> _A little side note, I originally intended to use Gmail SMTP to send the notifications via email, but after uploading to Google Cloud, I found it was not usable…_ 




### 3. Moving the Python script to Google Cloud

Having covered the basics, we now officially enter the main event of this article: moving the Python script to the cloud.

Initially, I aimed to use Google Cloud Run, but I found it too complicated after trying it out. I was actually too lazy to research it further since my needs were too minimal to require so many features; therefore, **I used Google Cloud Function** as a serverless solution, which is more commonly used to build serverless web services.
- If you haven't used Google Cloud before, please first go to the [**Console**](https://console.cloud.google.com/){:target="_blank"} to create a new project and set up your billing information.
- On the project console homepage, click on "Cloud Functions" in the resources section.



![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*pWDK9AQKpbDpgDltFfS9-g.png)

- Select "Create Function" at the top.



![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*ED2WPgfaSHEth3zWUJn05w.png)

- Enter the basic information.



![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*oetW_iIU9XywDbLZIa8tJQ.png)



> _⚠️ Note down the " **Trigger URL**"_ 





**Available regions:**
- `US-WEST1`, `US-CENTRAL1`, `US-EAST1` can enjoy free quotas for Cloud Storage services.
- `asia-east2` (Hong Kong) is closer to us, but requires a small payment for Cloud Storage.



> _⚠️ When creating Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage is needed to host the code._ 
 

> _⚠️ For detailed pricing, please refer to the end of the article._ 





**Select trigger condition:** HTTP

**Authentication:** Based on my needs, I want to be able to execute the script from an external link, so I chose "Allow unauthenticated invocations"; if you choose to require authentication, the subsequent Scheduler service will also need corresponding settings.

**Variables, networking, and advanced settings can be set in the variables for Python to use (this way, if parameters change, you don't have to modify the Python code):**


![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*qJC7rcjOnSeKWa8NiYxbpQ.png)


**How to call in Python:**
```python
import os

def main(request):
  return os.environ.get('test', 'DEFAULT VALUE')
```

No other settings need to be changed, just "Save" -> "Next".
- Select "Python 3.x" for the runtime and paste the written Python script, changing the entry point to "main".



![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*zCK21j82QwsHD1nARuZkBw.png)


**Supplement for main(args)**, as mentioned earlier, this service is primarily used for serverless web; thus, args is actually the Request object, from which you can obtain the HTTP GET query and HTTP POST body data, as follows:
```
Get GET Query information:
request_args = args.args
```

example: ?name=zhgchgli => request_args = [“name”:”zhgchgli”]
```
Get POST Body data:
request_json = request.get_json(silent=True)
```

example: name=zhgchgli => request_json = [“name”:”zhgchgli”]

**If using Postman to test POST, remember to use "Raw+JSON" for POST data, otherwise there will be nothing:**


![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*jl5joofEWPMLR3JuP988BQ.png)

- After the code part is OK, switch to "requirements.txt" and input the necessary package dependencies:



![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*2MTOKWDWlXbfjYP1qgp7Sw.png)


We use the "requests" package to help us make API calls, which is not included in the native Python library; therefore, we need to add it here:
```
requests>=2.25.1
```


The specified version here is ≥ 2\.25\.1, or you can simply enter `requests` to install the latest version.
- Once everything is okay, click "Deploy" to start the deployment.



![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*eQvtozhghRLQhxUgE9fMhw.png)


It takes about 1 to 3 minutes for the deployment to complete.
- After deployment, you can use the previously noted " **Trigger URL** " to execute and check if it runs correctly, or use "Actions" -> "Test Function" for testing.



![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*yv1wMHELWSrXiEvE44c9Sw.png)


If a `500 Internal Server Error` appears, it indicates that there is an error in the program. You can click on the name to view the "Logs" and find the reason:



![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*DeiRZT3wC1Z7Jv4WIRaM_Q.png)

```
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'db' referenced before assignment
```
- After clicking on the name, you can also click "Edit" to modify the script content.



![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*KqwYbY826bdVaSIlHUnpbA.png)



> **_If the test is successful, you are done! We have successfully moved the Python script to the cloud._** 




#### Additional Information on Variables

According to our needs, we need a place to store and read the token for the sign-in APP; since the token may expire, it needs to be requested again and written for use in the next execution.

To dynamically pass variables from external sources into the script, there are the following methods:
- \[Read Only\] The aforementioned runtime environment variables
- \[Temp\] Cloud Functions provides a /tmp directory for writing and reading files during execution, but it will be deleted after the execution ends. For details, please refer to the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/exec#file_system){:target="_blank"}.
- \[Read Only\] Sending data via GET/POST
- \[Read Only\] Including attachments



![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*AAXUcDRZNnRAqIFj02RnyA.png)


Using the relative path `./` in the program allows you to read it, **limited to reading and cannot be dynamically modified**; modifications can only be made in the console and redeployed.


> _To read and dynamically modify, you need to integrate with other GCP services, such as: Cloud SQL, Google Storage, Firebase Cloud Firestore…_ 




- \[Read & Write\] Here, I chose Firebase Cloud _Firestore_ because currently, only this option has a free quota available.


**According to the [Getting Started Steps](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#read_data){:target="_blank"}, after setting up the Firebase project; enter the Firebase backend:**


![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*0DO31noJ4a3xweb1annbSQ.png)


In the left menu, find " **Cloud Firestore** " -> " **Add Collection** "


![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*7c9sA8ZbxE6uGh6f-nfiVA.png)


Enter the collection ID.


![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*wcp94_25maNL9EoFJTOndA.png)


Enter the data content.

A collection can have multiple documents, and each document can have its own field content; it is very flexible to use.

**Using in Python:**

Please go to [GCP Console -> IAM & Admin -> Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts){:target="_blank"} and follow these steps to download the authentication private key file:

First, select the account:


![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*JeB9m4BWzfRCZSofHq2tLg.png)


At the bottom, click "Add Key" -> "Create New Key"


![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*xi9nQUy48-QlFI4BEdIMew.png)


Select "JSON" to download the file.


![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*bsphvdEHgg0XDnHAHMXJvg.png)


Place this JSON file in the same project directory as Python.

**In the local development environment:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade firebase-admin
```

Install the firebase-admin package.

In Cloud Functions, you need to add `firebase-admin` to the `requirements.txt`.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*d67oTblFFKaBHkGC77Mapw.png)

Once the environment is set up, we can read the data we just added:

firebase_admin.py:
```python
import firebase_admin
from firebase_admin import credentials
from firebase_admin import firestore

if not firebase_admin._apps:
  cred = credentials.Certificate('./authentication.json')
  firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred)
# If you call initialize_app multiple times, you will get the following error
# providing an app name as the second argument. In most cases you only need to call initialize_app() once. But if you do want to initialize multiple apps, pass a second argument to initialize_app() to give each app a unique name.
# So for safety, check if it has already been initialized before calling initialize_app

db = firestore.client()
ref = db.collection(u'example') // Collection name
stream = ref.stream()
for data in stream:
  print("id:"+data.id+","+data.to_dict())
```

> _If you are on Cloud Functions, in addition to uploading the authentication JSON file, you can also change the connection syntax to the following:_ 

```python
cred = credentials.ApplicationDefault()
firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred, {
  'projectId': project_id,
})

db = firestore.client()
```

> _If you see `Failed to initialize a certificate credential.`, please check if the authentication JSON is correct._ 

For more operations like adding and deleting, please refer to the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data){:target="_blank"}.
### 4. Set up automatic scheduling in Google Cloud

With the script ready, the next step is to automate its execution to achieve our final goal.
- Go to the [**Google Cloud Scheduler**](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudscheduler/){:target="_blank"} console homepage
- Click on "Create Job" at the top

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*5tNybi2HssmWoyJDQyPSJQ.png)

- Enter the basic job information

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*yqkJnt9PVYEllOpDtK1RmQ.png)

**Execution frequency:** Use the same input format as crontab. If you are not familiar with crontab syntax, you can directly use [**crontab.guru, this amazing website**](https://crontab.guru/#15_1_*_*_*){:target="_blank"}:

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*xnZBlcsMrQVJc6ewJIfAxA.png)

It can clearly translate the actual meaning of the syntax you set. (Click **next** to see the next execution time)

> _Here I set `15 1 * * *`, because the check-in only needs to be executed once a day, scheduled to run at 1:15 AM daily._ 

**URL section:** Enter the "trigger URL" noted earlier.

**Time zone:** Enter "Taiwan" and select Taipei Standard Time.

**HTTP method:** According to the previous Python code, we can just use GET.

**If you set "authentication" earlier,** remember to expand "SHOW MORE" to configure the authentication settings.

**After filling everything out**, click on "**Create**".
- After successful creation, you can choose to "**Run Now**" to test if it works properly.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*H_nsZNQ16iIKwThQpGJDmA.png)

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*X6pL0J4hGL_KodhsppvsJg.png)

- You can view the execution results and the last execution date.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*pUqTo-NM1z-srXbq1BM4rA.png)

> _⚠️ **Please note that an execution result of "failed" only refers to web status codes between 400 and 500 or errors in the Python program.**_

### Mission Accomplished!

We have achieved the goal of uploading the routine task Python script to the cloud and setting it up for automatic execution.
### Pricing Method

Another important aspect is the pricing method; Google Cloud and Linebot are not entirely free services, so understanding the charging method is crucial; otherwise, paying too much for a small script is not worth it compared to just running it on your computer.
#### Linebot

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*cfuKJxNoW4tvCEhqdC7oIQ.png)

Refer to the [official pricing](https://tw.linebiz.com/service/account-solutions/line-official-account/){:target="_blank"} information, which offers 500 messages free per month.
#### Google Cloud Functions

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*2431d2F1BNtEJUg845uDQg.png)

Refer to the [official pricing](https://cloud.google.com/functions/pricing?hl=zh-tw){:target="_blank"} information, which includes 2 million invocations per month, 400,000 GB-seconds, and 200,000 GHz-seconds of compute time, along with 5 GB of internet egress traffic.
#### Google Firebase Cloud Firestore

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*2t1boe9DQX1NBgGyYTrVnA.png)

Refer to the [official pricing](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quotas){:target="_blank"} information, which includes 1 GB of storage, 10 GB of traffic per month, 50,000 reads, and 20,000 writes/deletes per day; this is sufficient for light usage!
#### Google Cloud Scheduler

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*b9cvGpPqjKRFHa-45Yuzdw.png)

Refer to the [official pricing](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/pricing?hl=zh-tw){:target="_blank"} information, which allows each account to set up 3 free jobs.

> For scripts, the above free usage is more than enough!

#### Google Cloud Storage Conditional Free Tier

Despite trying to avoid it, there are still services that may incur charges.

After creating Cloud Functions, two Cloud Storage instances will be automatically created:

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*OvWXsZbwnM8sNfvdtDAIOA.png)

If you selected US-WEST1, US-CENTRAL1, or US-EAST1 for Cloud Functions, you can enjoy free usage limits:

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*arevMQGpsIumGlw_PE-hQQ.png)

I chose US-CENTRAL1, and indeed, the first Cloud Storage instance is in US-CENTRAL1, but the second is labeled **multiple regions in the US**; **I estimate that this will incur charges**.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*kuX9HlPTfMxbEg-sa3rJOQ.png)

Refer to the [official pricing](https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing?hl=zh-tw){:target="_blank"} information, which varies in price depending on the region of the host.

The code is not large, and I estimate that the minimum monthly charge should be 0.0X0 dollars (?).

> _⚠️ The above information was recorded as of 2021/02/21; actual prices may vary, and this is for reference only._

#### Budget Control Notification

Just in case… if there is a situation where charges exceed the free usage, I would like to receive notifications to avoid being unaware of potential billing issues caused by program errors.
- Go to the [**Console**](https://console.cloud.google.com/){:target="_blank"}
- Find the "**Billing Features**" card:

```markdown
![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*r0T8gZsaWroxhWxIxKwRWQ.png)

Click on "**View Detailed Deduction Records**" to enter.
- Expand the left menu and go to the "**Budget and Notifications**" feature.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*GtT4Sj9Q19O_QxWTWgM5UA.png)

- Click on "**Set Budget**" at the top.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*ytmGKw4sy6b-U3XAeI_geQ.png)

- Enter a custom name.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*_qgQMB_WsCuoxtJ4vA6xgw.png)

Next step.
- For the amount, enter the "**Target Amount**", which can be $1 or $10; we don't want to spend too much on small things.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*y6fIpzReQxZZRsVpZIk-tw.png)

Next step.

Here you can set actions that will trigger notifications when the budget reaches a certain percentage.

![](/assets/70a1409b149a/1*y4B62yjPWAy1pBQhZmiySQ.png)

**Check** the box for "**Send notifications via email to bill managers and users**", so that you can receive notifications immediately when the conditions are met.
