### Mi Home APP / Xiao Ai Speaker Region Issues

New Purchase of Xiaomi Air Purifier 3 & Recording Issues with Mijia and Xiao Ai Speaker Integration

### Introduction

Regarding Xiaomi’s fourth product; recently added a new member — **“Xiaomi Air Purifier 3”**  
Honestly, I never paid attention to the air quality in my room. I often felt uneasy when the outdoor air was hazy. Plus, I have chronic nasal allergies, so I decided to buy one for my room!

The new generation features a small screen on the main unit that shows the remaining filter life, current air quality, and allows mode selection, all without needing to connect to an app. Connecting to the app enables remote control but offers no additional special functions.

It's been two weeks since I bought it, and I've found the room's air quality to be quite good. When outdoor air is good, the indoor air quality values are around 001~006; when outdoor air is bad, indoor values are about 008~015. Values above 75 indicate poor air quality, and above 150 is considered severe. I probably should have bought a vacuum cleaner instead XD.  
But having a small air quality monitor guarding the home is still pretty nice.

### Mijia Smart Home Regional Feature Restrictions

The Mi Home app offers two region options: Taiwan and China. The region you choose affects the app's features. Initially, I selected China, thinking that since data security is questionable in any region, I might as well choose the one with more features to enjoy more functions.

After adding the Xiao Ai speaker last year, I noticed a more complex issue with region selection: to control Mi Jia smart appliances via the Xiao Ai speaker, both apps must have the same region selected, or they won't connect. This is frustrating because if the Xiao Ai speaker is set to Taiwan, it can work with KKBOX, but the smart features are limited (missing Xiao Ai training).

Therefore, my Xiao Ai speaker was originally set to the China region. When adding previously purchased appliances, I didn't encounter any issues. In the end, I successfully created a complete smart home routine: when leaving, saying goodbye to Xiao Ai will automatically turn off all appliances and activate the door camera; when arriving home, saying "I'm home" will automatically turn on the appliances. The experience is quite smooth!

### **Addition of Xiaomi Air Purifier 3**

Bought so many Xiaomi home products, of course the new member must join my Mi Home APP!  
However, I encountered a problem when adding it. The Taiwan version of the Xiaomi Air Purifier 3 cannot be added to my Mi Home APP unless the Mi Home APP region is switched back to Taiwan….

This is troublesome. The air purifier cannot be added; no matter how I try, it won’t work. It seems the pairing methods differ between Taiwan and China. Reluctantly, I had to switch the region back to Taiwan and reset all appliances... The Xiao Ai speaker was also switched back to Taiwan.

### Xiao Ai Speaker + Mijia Smart Home Scene Control

After switching the region back to Taiwan, the "Xiao Ai Training" feature disappeared; you can no longer set vocabulary to trigger corresponding Mi Home smart home scenes directly within the app. However, after multiple attempts, I found that if the smart home is linked and authorized with the Mi Home app, the scenes and appliances will still automatically sync to the Xiao Ai speaker for authorized control!

### BUG

My scene "Going Home" can be correctly recognized and executed by the Xiao Ai speaker, but "Going Out" cannot be recognized at all. After trying for an entire afternoon, I found out it was a Simplified-Traditional Chinese issue; when I changed the scene name to "出门" (Simplified), the Xiao Ai speaker could recognize and execute it properly.

> ***For those who encounter issues with scenarios not executing, try changing the scenario name and device name to Simplified Chinese.***

> *Done! Now you can set the app region to Taiwan and continue using Miga Smart Home as usual.*
