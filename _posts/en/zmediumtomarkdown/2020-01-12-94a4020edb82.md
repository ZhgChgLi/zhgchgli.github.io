### Mijia APP / Xiao Ai Speaker Regional Issues

Recently purchased Xiaomi Air Purifier 3 & documented the interaction issues between Mijia and Xiao Ai speakers.

### Introduction

This is my fourth article about Xiaomi; recently adding a new member — **"Xiaomi Air Purifier 3."** 
To be honest, I have never cared about the air quality in my room. I usually feel uneasy when the outdoor air looks hazy, and coupled with my long-term nasal allergies, I decided to buy one for my room!

The new generation has a small screen on the main unit that displays the remaining filter usage time, current air quality, and allows you to select the operating mode without needing to connect to the APP; if connected to the APP, you can control it remotely, but there are no other special features.

It's been two weeks since I bought it, and I've found that the air quality in my room is quite good; when the outdoor air is good, the indoor air quality value is around 001~006; when the outdoor air is poor, it's about 008~015; a value over 75 is considered poor air quality, and over 150 is severe; I should have bought a vacuum cleaner instead, XD. 
However, having a little air guardian at home is also quite nice.

### Mijia Smart Home Regional Function Limitations

The Mijia APP has two regions to choose from: Taiwan and China; the region selection affects the functions within the APP. When I set it up, I chose the China region, thinking that since data is not secure in any region, I might as well choose the one with more features to enjoy more functionalities.

After the addition of the Xiao Ai speaker last year, I noticed that the regional selection has a more complicated issue; if you want to control Mijia smart appliances with the Xiao Ai speaker, both APPs must be set to the same region; otherwise, they cannot connect. This is quite frustrating because if the Xiao Ai speaker is set to Taiwan, it can pair with KKBOX, but the smart features are a stripped-down version (missing Xiao Ai training).

Therefore, I originally set the region of my Xiao Ai speaker to China. I didn't encounter any issues adding the appliances I bought earlier, and in the end, I successfully established a complete smart home process: saying goodbye to Xiao Ai when leaving automatically turns off all appliances and activates the door camera; when returning home, saying I'm home automatically turns on the appliances; the experience is quite smooth!

### **The Addition of Xiaomi Air Purifier 3**

Having bought so many Xiaomi home products, of course, the new member should also join my Mijia APP! 
However, I encountered a problem when trying to add it; the Taiwan version of the Xiaomi Air Purifier 3 could not be added to my Mijia APP, and I had to switch the Mijia APP region back to Taiwan to do so...

This became troublesome, as only the air purifier could not be added; no matter how I tried, it seemed that the pairing methods for Taiwan and China were different. Reluctantly, I had to switch the region back to Taiwan and reset all the appliances... I also changed the Xiao Ai speaker back to Taiwan.

### Xiao Ai Speaker + Mijia Smart Home Scene Control

By switching the region back to Taiwan, I lost the "Xiao Ai training" feature; I could not directly set vocabulary in the APP to execute corresponding Mijia smart home scenes. After trying various methods, I discovered that if the smart home is linked and authorized to the Mijia APP, the scenes and appliances will still automatically connect to the Xiao Ai speaker for authorized control!

### BUG

My scene "Home" is correctly recognized and executed by the Xiao Ai speaker, but "Leaving" could not be recognized at all. After trying for an afternoon, I found out it was a simplified/traditional character issue; when I changed the scene name to "出门," the Xiao Ai speaker could recognize and execute it normally.

> **_So for friends who have issues with scene execution, you might want to change the scene name and device name to simplified characters._**

> _Done! This way, you can set the APP region to Taiwan and continue to use the Mijia smart home experience as before._
