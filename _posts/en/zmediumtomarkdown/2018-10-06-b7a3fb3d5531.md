### The Hardest Part is Getting Started

It's been over four years since I last managed a blog. I had an outstanding ad revenue of US$88 stuck for a long time. Recently, I discovered that I could proactively request to cancel my Adsense account, and as long as I reached the minimum payout threshold, Google would send me the final payment. This gave me the motivation to return to blogging.

As a newcomer, I decided to start with the simple title "The Hardest Part is Getting Started."

Looking back at my blogging history, it all began in middle school during my gaming craze. At that time, my family's computer was quite outdated, and there weren't many games to play. However, even without games, I still opened the computer every day, which felt exciting for me back then.

Due to these circumstances, most of my computer time was spent chatting with classmates on instant messaging and browsing websites. As you can imagine, it was quite empty and lacked a sense of achievement (at least others playing games could gain some sense of accomplishment).

During that time, "blogs" were gaining popularity, which felt very fresh to me. My first encounter was with the once-popular Wretch. When I set up my account and opened my blog for the first time, I felt, "Wow! I have my own website!" and "Wow! I can change the style; that's so cool!" Coincidentally, my school’s computer class taught web design (FrontPage 2003 / [阿聖網站](http://sheng.phy.nknu.edu.tw/){:target="_blank"}), so my first blog was all about exploring its features. I searched for materials, played with styles, and installed many flashy JavaScript plugins, while the quality of the content was mostly just filler.

This experience deepened my understanding of the online world, such as how to find information, how to troubleshoot broken plugins, and how to embed images, among other things.

Many of the resources I found were from forums, which were also thriving at that time. I was a typical lurker, just reading without posting, occasionally commenting, "Thanks for the generous sharing!" While browsing various forums, I discovered the concept of "free forums," where you could apply to be an admin and have your own forum. This felt like a step up from blogging—being an "admin," "admin," "admin"—how cool!

With the foundation I built from tinkering with blog settings, forums offered even more options (like creating sections, member permissions, and plugin centers). Everything could be customized, making it feel like I had entered another world.

There were many free forum systems available; I switched between them, trying out different ones. Some had incomplete features, some were restrictive, some were unstable, and others had intrusive ads. Eventually, I found [Marlito](https://free.com.tw/free-discuz-forum-marlito/){:target="_blank"}, which best met my needs, and I managed it for the longest time.

At the same time, my blog moved to "[優仕網部落格](http://blog.youthwant.com.tw){:target="_blank"}." This was because Wretch started imposing various restrictions. At that time, 優仕網 was just starting out, had fewer restrictions, and its features met my needs. I began focusing on content creation, with 70% of my posts sharing useful software (similar to 阿榮福利味) and the remaining 30% sharing my experiences with forums (settings/bug fixes).

I wrote about 30 articles, with daily views averaging around 200 and peaking at 500 (which seems insignificant now). My blog ranked in the top 10 on 優仕網, with most traffic coming from articles about useful software. After diligently managing it for over a year, I became busy with school in my third year of middle school and then high school, leading to sporadic posting. Later, I participated in training for a competition, and my blog was left unattended.

Since the blog name was too cringy, I only included a screenshot of the view count.

I later created a [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/about/?r=1-null_user){:target="_blank"} account, which was primarily for documenting technical articles about programming problems and solutions. However, Blogger was not user-friendly, and its basic features were insufficient, so I gave up after writing a few posts.

Eventually, I applied for a domain and purchased hosting to set up a WordPress blog, but I had to handle everything myself—settings, adjustments, and features. I couldn't focus on writing content, so my posts remained sporadic. When the hosting expired, I didn't renew it, and the site went offline until now.

In summary, my journey has evolved from feeling fascinated by blogging to exploring its features, then focusing on the essence of blogging—content creation—and finally sharing technical articles.

I became lazy, recorded less of the process, and failed to reflect and share. After tasting the sweetness of ad revenue, I gradually drifted further from my original intention, which was simply to share with everyone.
