### The First Step is Always the Hardest

It has been over 4 years since I last managed a blog. The previous ad revenue balance of US$88 has been stuck for a long time. Recently, I discovered that I could actively request to cancel my Adsense account, and as long as I reach the minimum payout threshold, Google will send me the last payment; this has given me the motivation to return to blogging.

As a newcomer, I’ll start with the simple title "The First Step is Always the Hardest."

Looking back at the history of blogging, it was around middle school during the peak of my gaming obsession. At that time, my family's computer was quite poor, and there weren't many games to play. However, in that playful age, even without games, I would still open the computer every day, which was already quite refreshing for me.

Due to the above factors, most of the time I spent on the computer was chatting with classmates on instant messaging and browsing websites. As you can imagine, it was quite hollow and lacked a sense of achievement (at least others playing games could gain a sense of accomplishment).

At that time, "Blog" was in its heyday, which was very new to me. The first platform I encountered was the once-popular Wretch. When I set up my account and opened my blog for the first time, I felt, "Wow! I have my own website," and "Wow! I can change styles, how cool!" Coincidentally, my school’s computer class taught web design (Front-Page 2003/ [Sheng's Website](http://sheng.phy.nknu.edu.tw/){:target="_blank"}), so my first blog was focused on exploring its features; finding materials, playing with styles, and installing many flashy JavaScript plugins, while the content quality was mostly trivial.

This gave me a deeper understanding of the online world, such as: how to find information? How to fix issues when plugins break? How to embed images?… and so on.

Many of the resources were obtained from forums, which were also in their heyday at that time. However, I was a typical lurker, just reading without posting, occasionally replying with "Thank you for your generous sharing." While browsing various forums, I discovered the concept of "free forums," where you could apply to be an admin and have your own forum, which felt like a higher level compared to blogging—being an "admin," "admin," "admin," how cool!!

Combining the basics I learned from setting up blogs, forums offered even more settings to play with (board creation/member permissions/plugin center), allowing for complete customization, as if I had entered another world.

There were many free forum systems; I kept switching and trying different ones. Some had incomplete features, some were restrictive, some were unstable, and some had too many intrusive ads. Eventually, I found [Marlito](https://free.com.tw/free-discuz-forum-marlito/){:target="_blank"}, which best met my needs and where I managed my forum the longest.

At the same time, my blog moved to "[Youth Want Blog](http://blog.youthwant.com.tw){:target="_blank"}." The reason was that Wretch started imposing various restrictions, while Youth Want was just starting out, offering fewer restrictions and features that met my needs. This time, I focused on the content of my articles, with 70% sharing useful programs (similar to A-Rong's Welfare Flavor) and the other 30% sharing experiences from managing forums (settings/bug fixes).

I wrote about 30 articles, with daily views around 200 people, peaking at 500 (which seems insignificant now). My blog was ranked in the top 10 on Youth Want, with most traffic coming from articles sharing useful programs. After seriously managing it for over a year, I encountered a busy academic schedule in my third year of junior high, then went to high school, and my blogging became sporadic. Later, I participated in training for competitors, and my blog was left to gather dust.

Due to the blog name being too childish, I only included a screenshot of the view count.

Later, I created another [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/about/?r=1-null_user){:target="_blank"} to document technical articles about problems and solutions encountered while programming. However, Blogger was not user-friendly, and its basic features were insufficient, so I gave up after writing a few articles.

In the later stages, I applied for a domain and purchased hosting to set up a WordPress blog, but I had to handle everything myself—settings, adjustments, and features… I couldn't focus on writing content, and it was still sporadic. After the hosting expired, I didn't renew it, and the website went offline until now.


In summary, the journey has evolved from finding the concept of blogging fresh and exciting -> to exploring and mastering the functionalities of blogs -> to focusing on the essence of blogging -> the content of articles -> to sharing technical articles.

Laziness set in, and I recorded less of the process, reflecting and sharing less. After tasting the sweetness of advertising revenue, I gradually drifted further away from my original intention, the pure enthusiasm to share with everyone.
