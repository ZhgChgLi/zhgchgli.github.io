### Starting is Always the Hardest Part

It has been over 4 years since I last managed a blog. My previous ad revenue of US$88 was stuck for a long time, but I recently discovered that I could actively request to cancel my Adsense account. As long as I reach the minimum payout threshold, Google will send me the final payment; this has motivated me to return to blogging.

As a newcomer, I’ll start with the simple title "Starting is Always the Hardest Part."

Looking back at my blogging history, it all began during my middle school years when I was crazy about games. At that time, my family's computer was quite poor, and there weren't many games to play. However, even without games, I still opened the computer every day, which felt quite refreshing for me back then.

Due to these factors, most of my computer time was spent chatting with classmates on instant messaging and browsing web pages. As you can imagine, it was quite empty and lacked a sense of achievement (at least others playing games could gain a sense of accomplishment).

During that time, "blogs" were booming, and it was something very new to me. The first platform I encountered was the popular Wretch. When I set up my account and opened my blog for the first time, I felt, "Wow! I have my own website," and "Wow! I can change the style, how cool!" Coincidentally, my school’s computer class taught web design (Front-Page 2003/ [Ah Sheng's Website](http://sheng.phy.nknu.edu.tw/){:target="_blank"}), so my first blog was focused on exploring its features. I searched for materials, played with styles, and installed many flashy JavaScript plugins, while the quality of the content was mostly just filler.

This gave me a deeper understanding of the online world, such as: how to find information, how to fix broken plugins, how to embed images, etc.

Many of the resources I found were from forums, which were also thriving at that time. However, I was a typical lurker, just reading without posting, occasionally commenting, "Thank you for your generous sharing." While browsing various forums, I discovered the concept of "free forums," where you could apply to be an admin and have your own forum. This felt like a whole new level compared to blogs—being an "admin," "admin," "admin," how cool!!

Combining the basics I learned from setting up blogs, forums offered even more customizable settings (like creating boards, member permissions, and plugin centers). It felt like entering another world.

There were many free forum systems available; I tried several, but some had incomplete features, some were restrictive, some were unstable, and some had too many intrusive ads. The one that left the most impression on me was [Marlito](https://free.com.tw/free-discuz-forum-marlito/){:target="_blank"}, which best met my needs, and I managed it for the longest time.

At the same time, my blog moved to "[Youth Want Blog](http://blog.youthwant.com.tw){:target="_blank"}." The reason was that Wretch started imposing various restrictions, while Youth Want was just starting out, offering fewer limitations and features that met my needs. This time, I focused on the content of my articles, with 70% sharing useful programs (similar to Ah Rong's Welfare Flavor) and the other 30% sharing my experiences with forums (settings/bug fixes).

I wrote about 30 articles, with daily views around 200 people, peaking at 500 (which seems insignificant now). My blog was among the top 10 on Youth Want, with most traffic coming from articles sharing useful programs. After seriously managing it for over a year, I encountered the busy schedule of my third year in middle school and high school, leading to an on-and-off writing habit. Later, I participated in training for competitors, and my blog was left unattended.

Since the blog name was too childish, I only included a screenshot of the view count.

Later, I created another [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/about/?r=1-null_user){:target="_blank"} to document technical articles about programming problems and solutions I encountered. However, Blogger was not user-friendly, and its basic features couldn't meet my needs, so I gave up after writing a few posts.

In the later stages, I applied for a domain and purchased hosting to set up a WordPress blog, but I had to handle everything myself—settings, adjustments, etc. I couldn't focus on writing content, and it became sporadic. After the hosting expired, I didn't renew it, and the website went offline until now.

In summary, my journey has evolved from feeling excited about blogging → to exploring blog features → to focusing on the essence of blogging—content → to sharing technical articles.

I became lazy, recorded less of the process, and failed to reflect and share. After tasting the sweetness of ad revenue, I gradually drifted further from my original intention, which was simply to share with everyone.
