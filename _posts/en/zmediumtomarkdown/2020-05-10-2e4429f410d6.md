### Easily Create a 'Pseudo' Transparent Phone Wallpaper Using iPhone

Using iMovie's green screen feature to create videos

### Just Because I'm Bored

[During the day, I work, getting exploited by capitalists; at night, I'm exploited by mass entertainment, yet I still can't reach the level of working during the day, studying at night, and critiquing on weekends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_dVHQBx-4k){:target="_blank"}!

Recently, while mindlessly relaxing, I **came across a common wallpaper app advertisement showcasing an eye-catching transparent wallpaper**; but it's obvious that such a thing is impossible. Even with the rear camera capturing real-time angles, it wouldn't align perfectly!

### Let's Be Smart Young People!

Although I know it's a special effect, I initially thought it would be very complicated; I didn't expect that the built-in iMovie app on the iPhone could create it with just a few taps.
#### **You will need:**
1. An iPhone (to use iMovie directly) and a phone for the shot
2. A second phone or camera for filming
3. A phone stand or a water bottle… or any object that can support the phone
4. [iMovie APP](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/imovie/id377298193){:target="_blank"} (free download)
5. A green background image (green screen)

With these 5 items, you can create a transparent effect!
#### Steps:
1. Set up the phone for filming
2. Record a clean video (without the phone in the shot)
3. Set the wallpaper of the phone to the green background
4. Record a video of the phone in action
5. Open the iMovie app to combine
6. Done

### Getting Started
#### 1\. Set up the phone and get the filming angle right

![I used two eel cans and a bottle of mineral water as a phone stand (a proper phone stand would be even better!) ](/assets/2e4429f410d6/1*-Y5H7G6VVPUUgTGaUB2f1A.jpeg)

I used two eel cans and a bottle of mineral water as a phone stand (a proper phone stand would be even better!)

The purpose of using a phone stand is to ensure that both videos have the same angle; otherwise, there will be a misalignment in the footage, making the effect less convincing. If you hold the phone, it's impossible to keep the angles identical in both videos.
#### 2\. Record a clean video

Record the clean video for as long as you want it to be.
#### 3\. Set the wallpaper of the phone to the green background

#### 4\. Record a video of the phone in action

**The video length should match the clean video; it's okay if it's longer, you can trim it later.**
#### 5\. Open the iMovie app and create a project

![Click '+' -> 'Video' -> Select 'Clean Video' -> 'Create Movie'](/assets/2e4429f410d6/1*Ju3cpubikU57M0fRadT_FA.jpeg)

Click '+' -> 'Video' -> Select 'Clean Video' -> 'Create Movie'

Insert the clean video into the project.
#### 6\. Move the playhead to the front

If you don't move the playhead to the start of the clean video, you will encounter a message saying "Move the playhead away from the end to add an overlay" when you insert the green screen video.
#### 7\. Insert the phone action video

### Tips
1. You may want to hide apps with green icons, like Line or Messages, to prevent them from showing up (since the chroma key relies on green).
2. Alternatively, you can use a blue background and chroma key blue; other colors can work too (but green/blue gives the best results).
3. There are many more creative possibilities with the same principle waiting for you to discover!

### Conclusion

Just for fun… I didn't expect iMovie to be this powerful!
