### Easily Create a 'Pseudo' Perspective Transparent Phone Wallpaper Using iPhone

Using iMovie's green screen feature to composite videos

### Anyway, I'm quite free

[During the day, I work, being exploited by capitalists; at night, I'm exploited by mass entertainment, still unable to achieve the state of working during the day, studying at night, and critiquing on weekends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_dVHQBx-4k){:target="_blank"}!

Recently, while mindlessly relaxing, **I stumbled upon a very common wallpaper app advertisement that showcased an eye-catching perspective transparent wallpaper**; but it’s obvious that it’s impossible, even if the rear camera captures the scene in real-time, the angles could never align so perfectly!

### We Need to Be Thoughtful Youth!

Although I know it's a special effect, I initially thought it would be very complicated; I didn't expect that the built-in iMovie app on the iPhone could create it easily with just a few taps.
#### **You only need:**
1. An iPhone (because you need to use iMovie directly), and a phone for filming
2. A phone or camera for shooting
3. A phone stand or a water bottle… or any item that can support the phone
4. [iMovie APP](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/imovie/id377298193){:target="_blank"} (free download)
5. A green background (green screen)

These 5 items can create a perspective effect!
#### Specific Process:
1. Set up the phone responsible for shooting
2. Directly shoot a clean video (without the phone in the frame)
3. Set the wallpaper of the phone to be included in the shot to a green background
4. Then shoot a video of the phone's operation
5. Open the iMovie APP to combine
6. Done

### Start
#### 1\. Set up the phone and find the right shooting angle


![I used two eel cans and a bottle of mineral water as a phone stand (a vertical phone stand would be even better!)](/assets/2e4429f410d6/1*-Y5H7G6VVPUUgTGaUB2f1A.jpeg)

I used two eel cans and a bottle of mineral water as a phone stand (a vertical phone stand would be even better!)

The purpose of using a phone stand for shooting is that we want both videos to have a unified angle; otherwise, there will be a shift in the frame, making the effect look less impressive. If handheld, it is impossible for both videos to have the exact same perspective.
#### 2\. Shoot a clean video

Shoot the clean video for as long as you want the video to be.
#### 3\. Set the wallpaper of the phone to be included in the shot to a green background

#### 4\. Shoot a video of the phone's operation

**The video duration should be the same as 2\. the clean video; it’s okay if it’s longer, you can trim it later.**
#### 5\. Open the iMovie APP to create a project

![“+” -> “Video” -> Select “ **Clean Video** ” -> “Create Movie”](/assets/2e4429f410d6/1*Ju3cpubikU57M0fRadT_FA.jpeg)

“+” -> “Video” -> Select “ **Clean Video** ” -> “Create Movie”

Insert the clean video into the project.
#### 6\. Move the playhead to the beginning

If you do not move the playhead of the clean video to the start of the video, you will encounter a message saying “ **Move the playhead away from the end to add an overlay** ” when inserting the green screen video later.
#### 7\. Insert the phone operation video

### Tips
1. You can first hide apps with green icons, such as Line, Messages... to prevent exposure (since the keying is based on green).
2. Alternatively, you can use a blue background and key out blue; other colors can also work (but green/blue yields the best results).
3. There are more creative ways to use the same principle waiting for you to discover!

### Conclusion

just for fun… I didn't expect iMovie to be this powerful!
