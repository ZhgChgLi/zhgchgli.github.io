### Easily Create a "Fake" Transparent Perspective Wallpaper on iPhone

Using iMovie's Green Screen Feature to Composite Videos

### Anyway, I'm Free

Recently, while mindlessly relaxing, **I came across a very common wallpaper app ad that showcased a transparent wallpaper with a see-through effect, which was quite eye-catching**; but obviously, it's impossible. Even with a rear camera live view, the angles can't match that perfectly!

### Let's Be Smart Youngsters!

Although I knew it was a special effect, I thought it would be very complicated; surprisingly, the built-in iMovie app on the iPhone allows you to create it with just a few simple taps.

#### **Only need:**

1. An iPhone (to use iMovie directly) and a phone for filming

2. A phone or camera responsible for shooting

3. Phone stand or water bottle… or any item that can support a phone

4. [iMovie APP](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/imovie/id377298193){:target="_blank"} (Free Download)

5. Green Background (Green Screen)

These 5 items are all you need to create a perspective effect!

#### Specific Process:

1. Set up the phone responsible for filming

2. Directly record a clean video (without the phone appearing in the frame)

3. Set the phone background to a green screen before filming.

4. Shoot another video demonstrating how to use the phone on camera.

5. Open iMovie APP to merge

6. Completed

### Start

#### 1. Set up your phone and find the right shooting angle

![I used two canned eels and a bottle of mineral water as a phone stand (of course, a proper phone stand is better!)](/assets/2e4429f410d6/1*-Y5H7G6VVPUUgTGaUB2f1A.jpeg)

I used two cans of eel and a bottle of mineral water as a phone stand (of course, a proper phone stand is better!)

The purpose of using a phone holder for filming is to ensure both videos have the same angle. Otherwise, the frames would shift, making the result less appealing. Holding the phone by hand cannot guarantee 100% identical viewpoints in both videos.

#### 2. Shoot a clean video segment

The video should be as long as needed; shoot only as long as the clean footage requires.

#### 3. Set the wallpaper of the phone in the shot to a green background

![“Settings” -> “Background Image” -> “Select the downloaded green background” -> “Set Both”](/assets/2e4429f410d6/1*qso6JJNOi2Ox_hMfLMAR6A.png)

"Settings" -> "Background Image" -> "Select the downloaded green background" -> "Set for both"

#### 4. Record a video demonstrating how to use the phone in the frame

**Video length same as 2. Clean video; it's okay if it's longer, can trim later.**

#### 5. Open the iMovie App to Create a Project

![](/assets/2e4429f410d6/1*GGZFGI_ttJyAc4L1GghZBw.png)

![「+」->「Video」-> Select "**Clean Video**" -> "Create Video"](/assets/2e4429f410d6/1*Ju3cpubikU57M0fRadT_FA.jpeg)

「+」->「Video」-> Select 「**Clean Video**」->「Create Video」

Insert a clean video into the project.

#### 6. Move Playback Position to the Beginning

![](/assets/2e4429f410d6/1*hCeZAoZggCU14s5rAmqv9Q.png)

If you do not move the clean video playback position to the beginning, an error "**Move the playhead away from the end to add an overlay**" will occur when inserting the green screen video later.

#### 7. Insert On-Screen Mobile Operation Video

![Select "Footage to be keyed" -> "…" -> "Green/Blue Screen" (commonly known as chroma key)](/assets/2e4429f410d6/1*VQZKKIb0Y0XdaetEeRBPJA.jpeg)

Select "Footage with On-Screen Actions" -> "…" -> "Green/Blue Screen" (commonly known as chroma key)

![Click the top "In-frame Operation Video" -> "Scroll to the frame with the green background" -> Click the "green area" -> Complete perspective transparency](/assets/2e4429f410d6/1*r2Y1PvoSM5IVrXGoekR1zA.png)

Click the top "In-frame Operation Video" -> "Scroll to the frame with the green background" -> Click the "green area" -> Complete perspective transparency

#### 8. Synthesis Complete! Export the Video

Confirm both videos end at the same time, click the top left "Done" -> "Share" at the bottom -> select the export target -> complete the export.

#### 9. Completion

### Tips

1. You can first hide apps with green icons, such as Line and Messages, to prevent revealing the trick (since the cutout is based on green).

2. You can use a blue background with blue cropping; other colors are also acceptable (but green/blue works best).

3. There are more ways to play with the same principle, waiting for you to discover!

### Conclusion

just for fun… I didn’t expect iMovie to be so powerful!
