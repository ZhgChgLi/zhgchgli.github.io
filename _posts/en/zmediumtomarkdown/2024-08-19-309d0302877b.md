Shortcuts (formerly known as Workflow) is a new feature that started with iOS 12; it allows users to create a series of tasks that can be executed with a single tap and set to run automatically in the background.

In addition to the built-in Shortcuts feature of iOS, Apple has also opened Siri Shortcuts / App Intents to developers in recent years, allowing third-party apps to integrate some of their functionalities into Shortcuts for users to combine.

Currently, the conditions for automatic execution are limited to iOS itself or Apple's own apps, such as: specific times, arriving at or leaving a location, detecting NFC, receiving messages, emails, or connecting to Wi-Fi, battery level, Do Not Disturb mode, detecting sound, etc.

Apple's own services do not require jailbreaking like the early days of SMS forwarding; the Shortcuts feature does not require jailbreaking or installing strange third-party apps.


> _There are already many online resources introducing how to use Shortcuts and providing ready-made scripts, so this article will not elaborate on that._ 





> _The cross-device message forwarding feature in iOS (Settings -> Messages -> Message Forwarding) only works for devices under the same Apple ID, so we will use Shortcuts to complete specific message forwarding._ 






> This article will only introduce three practical and simple use cases that I find very useful. 



### Use Case 1 — Automatic SMS Forwarding

In this era of rampant scam messages, I worry that elderly family members or children might receive scam messages and accidentally input their information, or that the elderly might not understand the security verification process for receiving SMS messages and need remote assistance to complete the verification; additionally, I am concerned that children might use their phones for activities that are not allowed.

#### Effect


![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*MNOa1KMy6ma6bg72ORVKMQ.jpeg)


The settings are as follows:
- When receiving a message containing "http", forward the message "content" to Line for me.
- When receiving a message containing "notification", forward the message "content" to Line for me.
- When receiving a message containing "verification code", forward the message "content" to Line for me.
- When receiving a message containing "authentication code", forward the message "content" to Line for me.


In practice, it can correctly execute sending even when the phone is in standby mode without being unlocked.
#### Setup Method
#### 1\. Install & Open [Shortcuts App](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/%E6%8D%B7%E5%BE%91/id915249334){:target="_blank"}
#### 2\. Switch to the "Automation" tab, select the "+" in the upper right corner, and scroll down to find "Message"


![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*2AwmA-hGh3wfOooT7bk_tA.png)



![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*ByusjAe6GYcw2xxhAbUpEw.png)

#### 3\. Set Message Conditions


![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*_TfkzZ618Tyhv56SFAF9EQ.png)



![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*8SWEjqiME5f-CTsj3-Sv8Q.png)

- "Message contains": `http` \( **= All messages with attached URLs will be forwarded** \)
**Multiple keywords need to create multiple shortcuts individually.**
- Change `「Confirm before running」` to `「Run immediately」`
- Click `「Next」`


**When — Other Settings:**
- "Sender": multiple, but must be added to contacts
- Both "Message contains" and "Sender" conditions must have at least one set, **therefore it is not possible to handle all messages without setting conditions**

#### 4\. Add Automation Action


![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*HRqCy5aG7IF_1FrgDZQkow.png)



![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*8HZSJh71uFI3fEeYSucfEA.png)



![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*IBjq-95inCO2paU17c1_CA.png)

- Select `「Add Blank Automation Action」`
- If you want to forward messages to Line, enter `「line」` in the search box to find the shortcut function provided by Line, and select Line's `「Send Message」` to choose the target you want to send to.



> **_Here, only the last four conversation partners or groups will appear. If the desired target does not appear, you can first go back to Line and send a few messages to the target or group, then come back to see it appear._** 





> **_The function of selecting contacts by phone number in Line for sending messages is invalid._** 




- Similarly, you can also use the action `「Send Message」` or `「Send Email」` \(as shown in the third image\) to forward the received message content to SMS \(if iCloud messages are not enabled, SMS fees may apply\) or Email.

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*RMAUM2pRhCgRqxtmV0inUw.png)



![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*Ek-898AJOGuyJY6d8yq3AA.png)


After adding the sending target
- First, click `Send "Message" to "XXX"`, in the `「Message」` input box
- Swipe right to find & click `「Shortcut Input」`
- Go back up and click to send `「Shortcut Input」 to "XXX"`, in the `「Shortcut Input」` input box
- A menu will pop up below, change the originally selected `「Message」` to `「Content」`
- Click the "X" next to the menu to close it
- Click the "Done" in the upper right corner



> **_If you want to change the target to send to XXX, you must first click the X on the right to remove the entire Line action, and then re-add the Line send message action with the new target._** 






![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*GhQp454scLZthbeNfuRaaQ.png)



![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*ie4WXuG1empP22dPBH0ZQQ.png)
```

- Confirm the final settings are:
`When I receive a message containing "XXX", treat the message as input and Line will send the "content" to "XXX"`
- No problem, click "Done" in the upper right corner.
**If clicking Done has no response, it may be encountering an iOS bug; you can ignore it and directly click back to return to the homepage.**
- Returning to the Shortcuts automation homepage allows you to view, pause, and modify this shortcut.

#### Done!

Just wait for new messages to come in; those that contain the specified keywords will be automatically forwarded (even if the phone is not unlocked). Due to current functional limitations, each keyword requires a separate shortcut, and if the same message contains different keywords, it will be sent twice.
### Scenario 2 — Automatically create reminders when packages arrive at convenience stores

I currently use Apple's built-in Reminders as my task management tool for daily activities, so I also hope to integrate reminders for things I need to be notified about, such as package arrivals at convenience stores, credit card payment notifications, etc.
#### Effect


![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*RHrXAyKcAfYxzEj6Lpsrhw.png)


The conditions are set as follows:
- Add a reminder when receiving a message containing "arrived" (Coupang uses "arrived")
- Add a reminder when receiving a message containing "delivered" (usually "delivered")

#### Setting Method
#### 1. Install & open the [Shortcuts App](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/%E6%8D%B7%E5%BE%91/id915249334){:target="_blank"}
#### 2. Switch to the "Automation" tab, select the "+" in the upper right corner, and scroll down to find "Messages"


![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*2AwmA-hGh3wfOooT7bk_tA.png)



![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*ByusjAe6GYcw2xxhAbUpEw.png)

#### 3. Set message conditions


![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*_TfkzZ618Tyhv56SFAF9EQ.png)



![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*fSDHpXq8bQ9F-n3Fui-AbA.png)


As mentioned in the previous section about automatically forwarding messages, set `Message content contains "delivered"` and change it to `“Run Immediately”`.
#### 4. Add automation actions & set reminder time


![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*7LbpXGONx2ZzBjU7sxQmzg.png)



![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*XpNMITjSkBQcyZiF0nm7mA.png)



![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*s8Cf39l2aHlOHHQ1opITwA.png)



![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*OM3xUKhtSglRmEK4ezkX4Q.png)


First, we need to set the expiration date for the reminder by adding a date variable that calculates the time when the message is received + how much time equals the reminder time we want.
- Select `“Add Blank Automation Action”`
- Search for `“Adjust Date”` in the search box below
- Select `“Adjust Date”`
- Choose `Add 0 seconds to "Date"` in the `“Date”` input box
- Select the variable below and choose `“Current Date”`
- Choose `Add 0 "seconds"` in the `“Seconds”` input box, and change it to `“Days”`
- Enter the number of days you want the reminder to expire; here, I enter 3 days
- Click the "X" next to the menu to close

#### 5. Add reminder action


![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*MjX3f6JlEjlt6VmB1ghXGw.png)



![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*-Y67HoUhMzkWJnFBjKdavA.png)

- In the search box, enter `“Reminder”`, scroll down to find & click `“Add Reminder”`



![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*SLKK3MFw6tB5VRC5ceRrSg.png)



![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*X-br6puk9YQnQOKPI2j1_g.png)



![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*bNvUFz5nm49uEwT6F7eDWw.png)


After adding the "Add Reminder" action:
- First, click `Add "Reminder" to "Reminders" without prompting` in the first `“Reminder”` input box
- Swipe right to find & click `“Shortcut Input”`
- Click `Add "Shortcut Input" to "Reminders" without prompting` in the `“Shortcut Input”` input box
- A menu will pop up below; change the originally selected `“Message”` to `“Content”`
- Click the "X" next to the menu to close

#### 6. Set reminder notifications


![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*9l0_3-l1HtC5QneleaWqgw.png)



![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*VPTvkR9dP7t8NUmUIGBk0g.png)

```markdown
![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*HIAeBEJymYYDyU_iHUMkMg.png)

- Change `「不提示」` to `「提示」`
- In the input box for `「下午 2:00」`, select the variable `「已調整日期」`
- Click the "X" next to the menu to close
- If everything is fine, click "完成" in the upper right corner  
**If clicking "完成" does not respond, it may be an iOS bug; you can ignore it and directly click back to return to the homepage.**

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*LMZN7k7CUqnoMjMXnxozlw.png)

- Return to the Shortcuts Automation homepage to view, pause, or modify this shortcut.

#### Done!

As mentioned earlier, just wait for new messages to come in; if they contain the specified keywords, reminders will be automatically created (even if the phone is locked). Due to current functionality limitations, a separate shortcut must be created for each keyword. If the same message contains different keywords, it will create reminders twice.
### Scenario 3 — Automatically create reminder tasks when receiving credit card bill emails

Another life notification is the credit card bill notification; the setup is similar to SMS. When receiving an email, it can also trigger the shortcut automation to add reminders. However, since the automation feature is currently not available for third-party apps, it can only be triggered using the Apple [Mail App](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/%E9%83%B5%E4%BB%B6/id1108187098){:target="_blank"}.
#### Effect

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*dIjLPrswhuX1YAWV95xqZA.png)

The conditions are set as follows:
- **Add a reminder when the email subject contains "信用卡帳單"**

> _Please note that each company's format is different Orz; some call it "信用卡電子帳單," "信用卡電子對帳單," and Cathay even calls it "信用卡XXXX年X月電子帳單."_

> _Since Regex is temporarily not supported, only text matching can be used. As mentioned earlier, **a separate shortcut must be created for each keyword.**_

#### 1. Confirm that you have installed the [Mail App](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/%E9%83%B5%E4%BB%B6/id1108187098){:target="_blank"} and completed the email account login (Gmail is also acceptable)

#### 2. Confirm email fetching settings

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*x-AXNqQSC5gA30JgLPqTBg.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*MxpSEg0v9eraupvq8zFaXw.png)

Confirm that "Settings" -> "Mail" -> "Accounts" -> "Fetch New Data" is set to fetch or push.
#### 3. Install & open the [Shortcuts App](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/%E6%8D%B7%E5%BE%91/id915249334){:target="_blank"}
#### 4. Switch to the "Automation" tab, select the "+" in the upper right corner, and scroll down to find "Email"

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*2AwmA-hGh3wfOooT7bk_tA.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*as3DfHXPDdBfvEooM1c5lQ.png)

#### 3. Set email conditions

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*WDMnyVvYOSm8v_LNh2ibJw.png)

- "Subject contains": `信用卡帳單` **Multiple keywords must be individually created as separate shortcuts.**
- Change "Confirm before running" to `Run Immediately`
- Click "Next"

**When — Other settings:**
- "Sender": multiple, but must be added to contacts
- Other filtering conditions — Account: can filter sources as iCloud or Gmail
- Other filtering conditions — Recipient: multiple, but must be added to contacts, generally your own multiple accounts

#### 4. Add automation actions & set reminder time

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*2sUeTR5EqDecPNcZXFCV0w.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*XpNMITjSkBQcyZiF0nm7mA.png)
```

```markdown
![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*amR27AS5kKF670oHzaGMrw.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*qXgzgkOlsPUGfGdeFjOVlA.png)

First, set the due date for the reminder by adding a date variable that calculates the time when the message is received plus the duration we want for the reminder.
- Select `「Add a blank automation action」`
- In the search box below, search for `「Adjust Date」`
- Select `「Adjust Date」`
- In the `「Date」` input box, choose `Add 0 seconds to the "Date"`
- Select the variable below and choose `「Current Date」`
- Change `Add 0 "seconds"` in the `「Seconds」` to `「Days」`
- Enter the number of days you want for the reminder; here, I input 3 days
- Click the "X" next to the menu to close

#### 5\. Set Up Email Filtering

Unlike triggering messages one by one, the email trigger is batch retrieval, so as long as there are emails with keywords in the subject line in that batch, those new emails will also be sent in together.

> _Not sure if it's a shortcut bug, but the result is as such._

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*3zZT8iZ1fSNwrjYhCm0F5Q.png)

For example: If three emails are batch retrieved, one from Carrefour, one for a credit card bill, and one from Uber, all three will be input into the shortcut for us; therefore, we need to add another step to filter out the emails with the keywords we want.

**Virtual Logic:**
```lua
for email_title in emails
  if email_title.contain("credit card bill") then
    add reminder
  else
  end 
end
```

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*V-4ouSRQX-MhI-ncaCR3Dw.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*maHF3NW1DB95Jr4SiV3XEw.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*s9hCMUFQNags7zoDvdrP6A.png)

- In the search box, enter `「Repeat」`, scroll down to find and click `「Repeat Each」`
- After adding, it will grab the wrong variable; select `Repeat each item in "Adjusted Date"` in the `「Adjusted Date」` input box, and choose `「Clear Variable」`
- After clearing, select `Repeat each item in "Items"` in the `「Items」` input box, and choose `「Shortcut Input」`

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*PmXXoOsZWHvbLXdxCvUYGw.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*Mp1AfBo8PUoaqM2vP1I1Aw.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*Bs7n-3RfxgpNf-VCZl8oCg.png)

- In the search box, enter `「If」`, scroll down to find and click `「If」`
- At this point, the position will be incorrect

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*5GA0RhCp5fKbKRXU-Qt5UA.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*P21sXnZAW32vhT-OK0VWzg.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*1F2M_1jgfI3bnrkUt9tjXg.png)

- Drag the `If "Repeat Results" "Condition"` action below `Repeat each item in "Shortcut Input"` (inside)
- Confirm the final position as shown in the second image above; if incorrect, please delete the repeat and if and redo from the previous step
- Click the `「Repeat Results」` input box of `If "Repeat Results" "Condition"` and change the selection to `「Title」`, then click the "X" next to the menu to close

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*oo0Fzp6GNRQjxmvoEHooKg.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*UTQvPw2Cv1dSjLuAAiaYnQ.png)

- Click the `「Title」` input box of `If "Title" "Condition"` and change the selection to `「Contains」`, enter `「credit card bill」`, and press "Done" on the keyboard

#### 6\. Set Up Email Filtering

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*jmPVupVw8TQ00Miz48Q8Og.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*Lx5AXqfxjspkzlHSfFj5Ig.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*Kk70UCejiowwqO1rV5omsg.png)

- In the search box, enter "Reminder", scroll down to find and click "Add Reminder"
- Similarly, the position will be incorrect at this point
- Drag the `Add "Reminder" to "Reminder" and "Do Not Notify"` action below `If "Title" "Contains" "credit card bill"` (inside)
- Confirm the final position as shown in the third image above; if incorrect, please delete the repeat and if and redo from the previous step
```

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*N6spwFxJjyHCz0Q5IC0b4A.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*XhNCbQG07DVAqKxZnxRy2Q.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*pKUYETmy4wBdWb7mUzj47A.png)

After adding "Add Reminder"
- Click on the first `“Reminder”` input box of `Add “Reminder” to “Reminders” and “Do Not Notify”`
- Swipe right to find and click `“Repeat Items”`
- Go back up and click on the `“Repeat Items”` input box, changing the originally selected `“Email”` to `“Title”`
- Click the "X" next to the menu to close

#### 6\. Set Reminder Notifications

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*JmFLj-I0r68LIqqqcLi1DA.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*WJfPSQaJ5JpG4QD8yTMkOg.png)

- Change `“Do Not Notify”` to `“Notify”`
- In the `“2:00 PM”` input box for `at time 2:00 PM`, select the variable `“Adjusted Date”`
- Click the "X" next to the menu to close
- If there are no issues, click "Done" in the upper right corner  
**If clicking Done does not respond, it may be an iOS bug; you can ignore it and directly click back to return to the homepage.**

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*ophe7BX2jn1ZB0g-OuMFZA.png)

- Return to the Shortcuts Automation homepage to view, pause, or modify this shortcut.

#### Completed!

The email setup is relatively more complex because it involves batch extraction, so it needs to be filtered again, and then the filtered results will create reminders.
- Now, if there are new emails and the Apple email extraction contains a credit card bill title, it will be created automatically!
- Since Apple Mail is extracted (if not iCloud), the email reception will not be immediate and will be delayed for a while.

### Others

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*5VxW2-kFjuagDwnRZlisHw.png)

The Shortcuts automation will trigger a notification upon completion, which cannot be turned off.  
### End

You have now completed several basic automation integration functions, saving you effort in your daily routine with just a few simple steps; other advanced integrations, such as API integration into Notion or more complex integrations, can also be technically achieved. **What is lacking is not technology but your imaginative automation ideas!**
