Shortcuts (formerly known as Workflow) is a feature introduced in iOS 12 that allows users to create a series of tasks that can be executed with a single tap and set to run automatically in the background.

In addition to the built-in Shortcut features in iOS, Apple has also opened up Siri Shortcuts / App Intents to developers in recent years, allowing third-party apps to integrate some of their functionalities into Shortcuts for users to combine.

Currently, the conditions for automatic execution are limited to iOS itself or Apple's own apps, such as: specific times, arriving at or leaving a location, detecting NFC, receiving messages, emails, or connecting to Wi-Fi, battery level, Do Not Disturb mode, detecting sounds, etc.

Apple's own services do not require jailbreaking like earlier methods for forwarding messages; the Shortcut feature does not require jailbreaking or installing strange third-party apps.

> _There are already many resources online explaining how to use Shortcuts and providing ready-made scripts, so this article will not elaborate on that._

> _The cross-device message forwarding feature in iOS (Settings -> Messages -> Message Forwarding) only works for devices using the same Apple ID, so we will use Shortcuts to help us forward specific messages._

> This article will only introduce three practical and simple use cases that I find very useful.

### Use Case 1 — Automatically Forwarding Messages

In this age of rampant scam messages, I worry that elderly family members or children might receive scam messages and accidentally input their information, or that the elderly might not understand the process of receiving verification messages for account security and need help verifying remotely. Additionally, I am concerned that children might use their phones for things they shouldn't.

#### Effect

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*MNOa1KMy6ma6bg72ORVKMQ.jpeg)

The conditions are set as follows:
- When receiving a message containing "http", forward the message "content" to Line for me.
- When receiving a message containing "notification", forward the message "content" to Line for me.
- When receiving a message containing "verification code", forward the message "content" to Line for me.
- When receiving a message containing "authentication code", forward the message "content" to Line for me.

In practice, even when the phone is in standby mode and not unlocked, it can still correctly execute the sending.
#### Setup Instructions
#### 1. Install & Open [Shortcuts App](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/%E6%8D%B7%E5%BE%91/id915249334){:target="_blank"}
#### 2. Switch to the "Automation" tab, select the "+" in the upper right corner, and scroll down to find "Messages"

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*2AwmA-hGh3wfOooT7bk_tA.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*ByusjAe6GYcw2xxhAbUpEw.png)

#### 3. Set Message Conditions

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*_TfkzZ618Tyhv56SFAF9EQ.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*8SWEjqiME5f-CTsj3-Sv8Q.png)

- "Message contains": `http` \( **= any message with a URL will be forwarded** \)
**Multiple keywords need to be set up as separate shortcuts.**
- Change `“Confirm before running”` to `“Run immediately”`
- Click `“Next”`

**When — Other Settings:**
- "Sender": multiple, but must be added to contacts.
- At least one of the two conditions, "Message contains" or "Sender", must be set, **therefore it is not possible to handle all messages without conditions.**

#### 4. Add Automation Action

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*HRqCy5aG7IF_1FrgDZQkow.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*8HZSJh71uFI3fEeYSucfEA.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*IBjq-95inCO2paU17c1_CA.png)

- Choose `“Add a blank automation action”`
- If you want to forward to Line messages, type `“line”` in the search box to find the shortcut function provided by Line, and select Line's `“Send Message”` to choose the target you want to send to.

> **_Here, only the last four conversation partners or groups will appear. If your desired target does not appear, you can first go back to Line and send a few messages to the target or group, then come back to see it appear._**

> **_The option to select contacts by phone number does not work for sending messages in Line._**

- Similarly, you can also use the `“Send Message”` or `“Send Email”` action (as shown in the third image) to forward the received message content to SMS (if iCloud messages are not enabled, you may incur SMS charges) or Email.

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*RMAUM2pRhCgRqxtmV0inUw.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*Ek-898AJOGuyJY6d8yq3AA.png)

After adding the sending target:
- First, click on `Send "Message" to "XXX"`, and in the `“Message”` input box,
- Swipe right to find & click `“Shortcut Input”`
- Go back to the top and click on `Send "Shortcut Input" to "XXX"`, and in the `“Shortcut Input”` input box,
- A menu will pop up, change the originally selected `“Message”` to `“Content”`
- Click the "X" next to the menu to close it
- Click the "Done" in the upper right corner

> **_If you want to change the target to send to XXX, you need to first click the "X" on the right to remove the entire Line action, and then re-add the Line send message action with the new target._**

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*GhQp454scLZthbeNfuRaaQ.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*ie4WXuG1empP22dPBH0ZQQ.png)

- Confirm that the final settings result is:
`When I receive a message containing "XXX", receive the message as input, Line will send "Content" to "XXX"`
- If everything is fine, click "Done" in the upper right corner.
**If clicking Done does not respond, it may be an iOS bug; you can ignore it and just click back to return to the home page.**
- Back on the Shortcuts automation home page, you can view, pause, or modify this shortcut.

#### Done!

Just wait for new messages to come in; if they contain the specified keywords, they will be automatically forwarded (even if the phone is not unlocked). Due to current functional limitations, each keyword must have a separate shortcut, and if the same message contains different keywords, it will be sent twice.
### Use Case 2 — Automatically Create Reminder Tasks When Packages Arrive at Convenience Stores

I currently use Apple's built-in Reminders as a tool for managing daily tasks, so I also want to integrate reminders for things I need to be notified about, such as package arrivals at convenience stores, credit card payment notifications, etc.
#### Effect

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*RHrXAyKcAfYxzEj6Lpsrhw.png)

The conditions are set as follows:
- When receiving a message containing "arrived", add a reminder (Coupang uses "arrived")
- When receiving a message containing "delivered", add a reminder (usually "delivered")

#### Setup Instructions
#### 1. Install & Open [Shortcuts App](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/%E6%8D%B7%E5%BE%91/id915249334){:target="_blank"}
#### 2. Switch to the "Automation" tab, select the "+" in the upper right corner, and scroll down to find "Messages"

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*2AwmA-hGh3wfOooT7bk_tA.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*ByusjAe6GYcw2xxhAbUpEw.png)

#### 3. Set Message Conditions

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*_TfkzZ618Tyhv56SFAF9EQ.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*fSDHpXq8bQ9F-n3Fui-AbA.png)

As in the previous section on automatically forwarding messages, set the `Message contains "delivered"` condition and change it to `“Run immediately”`.
#### 4. Add Automation Action & Set Reminder Time

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*7LbpXGONx2ZzBjU7sxQmzg.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*XpNMITjSkBQcyZiF0nm7mA.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*s8Cf39l2aHlOHHQ1opITwA.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*OM3xUKhtSglRmEK4ezkX4Q.png)

First, we need to set the due date for the reminder. Add a date variable to calculate the time when the message is received plus how much time equals the reminder time we want.
- Choose `“Add a blank automation action”`
- In the search box below, search for `“Adjust Date”`
- Select `“Adjust Date”`
- Choose `Add 0 seconds to "Date"` in the `“Date”` input box
- Select the variable below and choose `“Current Date”`
- Choose `Add 0 "seconds"` in the `“Seconds”` input box, change it to `“Days”`
- Enter the number of days you want the reminder to be due; here, I input 3 days.
- Click the "X" next to the menu to close it.

#### 5. Add Reminder Action

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*MjX3f6JlEjlt6VmB1ghXGw.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*-Y67HoUhMzkWJnFBjKdavA.png)

- In the search box, type `“Remind”`, scroll down to find & click `“Add Reminder”`

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*SLKK3MFw6tB5VRC5ceRrSg.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*X-br6puk9YQnQOKPI2j1_g.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*bNvUFz5nm49uEwT6F7eDWw.png)

After adding the `Add Reminder` action:
- First, click on `Add "Reminder" to "Reminders" without prompt`, in the first `“Reminder”` input box,
- Swipe right to find & click `“Shortcut Input”`
- Click on `Add "Shortcut Input" to "Reminders" without prompt`, in the `“Shortcut Input”` input box,
- A menu will pop up, change the originally selected `“Message”` to `“Content”`
- Click the "X" next to the menu to close it.

#### 6. Set Reminder Notification

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*9l0_3-l1HtC5QneleaWqgw.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*VPTvkR9dP7t8NUmUIGBk0g.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*HIAeBEJymYYDyU_iHUMkMg.png)

- Change `“No Prompt”` to `“Prompt”`
- Select `At time "2:00 PM"` in the `“2:00 PM”` input box, choose the variable `“Adjusted Date”`
- Click the "X" next to the menu to close it
- If everything is fine, click "Done" in the upper right corner.
**If clicking Done does not respond, it may be an iOS bug; you can ignore it and just click back to return to the home page.**

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*LMZN7k7CUqnoMjMXnxozlw.png)

- Back on the Shortcuts automation home page, you can view, pause, or modify this shortcut.

#### Done!

As mentioned earlier, just wait for new messages to come in; if they contain the specified keywords, a reminder will be automatically created (even if the phone is not unlocked). Due to current functional limitations, each keyword must have a separate shortcut, and if the same message contains different keywords, two reminders will be created.
### Use Case 3 — Automatically Create Reminder Tasks When Receiving Credit Card Bill Emails

Another life notification is the credit card bill notification; the setup is similar to messages, allowing the automation to add reminders when receiving emails. However, since the automation feature is currently not available for third-party apps, it can only be triggered using Apple's [Mail App](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/%E9%83%B5%E4%BB%B6/id1108187098){:target="_blank"}.
#### Effect

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*dIjLPrswhuX1YAWV95xqZA.png)

The conditions are set as follows:
- **When receiving an email with the subject containing "credit card bill", add a reminder.**

> _Please note that each company's format is different. Some may call it "credit card electronic bill," "credit card electronic statement," and Cathay's is even more specific, calling it "credit card XXXX year X month electronic bill."_

> _Currently, since Regex is not supported, you can only use text matching, so as mentioned earlier, **each keyword must have a separate shortcut.**_

#### 1. Ensure you have installed the [Mail App](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/%E9%83%B5%E4%BB%B6/id1108187098){:target="_blank"} and logged into your email account (Gmail is also acceptable).

#### 2\. Confirm Email Fetch Settings

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*x-AXNqQSC5gA30JgLPqTBg.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*MxpSEg0v9eraupvq8zFaXw.png)

Confirm that "Settings" -> "Mail" -> "Accounts" -> "Fetch New Data" is set to fetch or push.

#### 3\. Install & Open [Shortcuts App](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/%E6%8D%B7%E5%BE%91/id915249334){:target="_blank"}

#### 4\. Switch to the "Automation" tab, select the "+" in the top right corner, and scroll down to find "Email"

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*2AwmA-hGh3wfOooT7bk_tA.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*as3DfHXPDdBfvEooM1c5lQ.png)

#### 3\. Set Email Conditions

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*WDMnyVvYOSm8v_LNh2ibJw.png)

- "Subject Contains": `Credit Card Bill` **Multiple keywords need to be set up as separate shortcuts.**
- Change "Confirm Before Running" to `Run Immediately`
- Click "Next"

**When — Other Settings:**
- "Sender": multiple, but must be added to contacts
- Other filtering conditions — Account: can filter sources as iCloud or Gmail
- Other filtering conditions — Recipient: multiple, but must be added to contacts, usually your own multiple accounts

#### 4\. Add Automation Action & Set Reminder Time

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*2sUeTR5EqDecPNcZXFCV0w.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*XpNMITjSkBQcyZiF0nm7mA.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*amR27AS5kKF670oHzaGMrw.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*qXgzgkOlsPUGfGdeFjOVlA.png)

First, set the due date for the reminder, add a date variable to calculate the time when the message is received + how much time equals the reminder time we want.
- Choose `“Add Blank Automation Action”`
- Search for `“Adjust Date”` in the search box below
- Select `“Adjust Date”`
- Choose `Add 0 seconds` in the `“Date”` input box
- Select the variable below and choose `“Current Date”`
- Change `Add 0 “seconds”` to `“days”`
- Enter the number of days you want for the reminder; here, I input 3 days
- Click the "X" next to the menu to close

#### 5\. Set Email Filtering

Unlike triggering messages one by one, email triggers are batch fetched, so as long as there are emails with the keyword in the subject in that batch, those new emails will also come in together.

> _Not sure if it's a Shortcuts bug, but the result is as such._

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*3zZT8iZ1fSNwrjYhCm0F5Q.png)

For example: If three emails are batch fetched, one from Carrefour, one for a credit card bill, and one from Uber, all three will be inputted into the shortcut; therefore, we need to add another step to filter out the emails we want.

**Virtual Logic:**
```lua
for email_title in emails
  if email_title.contain("Credit Card Bill") then
    Add Reminder
  else
  end 
end
```

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*V-4ouSRQX-MhI-ncaCR3Dw.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*maHF3NW1DB95Jr4SiV3XEw.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*s9hCMUFQNags7zoDvdrP6A.png)

- In the search box, enter `“Repeat”`, scroll down and click `“Repeat Each”`
- After adding, it will grab the wrong variable; select `Repeat Each Item in “Adjusted Date”` in the `“Adjusted Date”` input box, and choose `“Clear Variable”`
- After clearing, select `Repeat Each Item in “Items”` in the `“Items”` input box, and choose `“Shortcut Input”`

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*PmXXoOsZWHvbLXdxCvUYGw.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*Mp1AfBo8PUoaqM2vP1I1Aw.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*Bs7n-3RfxgpNf-VCZl8oCg.png)

- In the search box, enter `“If”`, scroll down and click `“If”`
- At this point, the position will be incorrect

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*5GA0RhCp5fKbKRXU-Qt5UA.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*P21sXnZAW32vhT-OK0VWzg.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*1F2M_1jgfI3bnrkUt9tjXg.png)

- Drag the `If “Repeat Results” “Condition”` action below `Repeat Each Item in “Shortcut Input”` (inside)
- Confirm the final position as shown in the second image above; if incorrect, delete the repeat and if and redo from the previous step
- Click the `“Repeat Results”` input box of `If “Repeat Results”`, change the selection to `“Title”`, and click the "X" next to the menu to close

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*oo0Fzp6GNRQjxmvoEHooKg.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*UTQvPw2Cv1dSjLuAAiaYnQ.png)

- Click the `“Title”` input box of `If “Title” “Condition”`, change the selection to `“Contains”`, enter `“Credit Card Bill”`, and click "Done" on the keyboard.

#### 6\. Set Email Filtering

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*jmPVupVw8TQ00Miz48Q8Og.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*Lx5AXqfxjspkzlHSfFj5Ig.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*Kk70UCejiowwqO1rV5omsg.png)

- In the search box, enter “Reminder”, scroll down and click “Add Reminder”
- Again, the position will be incorrect at this point
- Drag `Add “Reminder” to “Reminders” and “Do Not Notify”` action below `If “Title” “Contains” “Credit Card Bill”` (inside)
- Confirm the final position as shown in the third image above; if incorrect, delete the repeat and if and redo from the previous step

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*N6spwFxJjyHCz0Q5IC0b4A.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*XhNCbQG07DVAqKxZnxRy2Q.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*pKUYETmy4wBdWb7mUzj47A.png)

After adding “Add Reminder”
- Click the first `“Reminder”` input box of `Add “Reminder” to “Reminders” and “Do Not Notify”`
- Swipe right to find and click `“Repeat Items”`
- Go back up and click the `“Repeat Items”` input box, change the originally selected `“Email”` to `“Title”`
- Click the "X" next to the menu to close

#### 6\. Set Reminder Notification

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*JmFLj-I0r68LIqqqcLi1DA.png)

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*WJfPSQaJ5JpG4QD8yTMkOg.png)

- Change `“Do Not Notify”` to `“Notify”`
- Choose `At Time 2:00 PM` in the `“2:00 PM”` input box, select the variable `“Adjusted Date”`
- Click the "X" next to the menu to close
- If everything is fine, click "Done" in the top right corner.
**If clicking Done does not respond, you may have encountered an iOS bug; you can ignore it and just click back to return to the home page.**

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*ophe7BX2jn1ZB0g-OuMFZA.png)

- Back on the Shortcuts Automation home page, you can view, pause, or modify this shortcut.

#### Done!

The email setup is relatively more complex because it involves batch fetching, so it needs to be filtered again, and then create reminders from the filtered results.
- Now, if there are new emails, and the Apple Mail fetches them, if there is a credit card bill in the subject, it will be created automatically!
- Since Apple Mail uses fetching (not iCloud), the email reception will not be immediate and will be delayed for a while.

### Other

![](/assets/309d0302877b/1*5VxW2-kFjuagDwnRZlisHw.png)

The Shortcuts automation will trigger a notification upon completion, which cannot be turned off.

### Conclusion

You have now completed several basic automation integration functions, saving you effort in your daily routine with just a few simple steps; other advanced integrations, such as API connections to Notion or more complex integrations, can also be achieved technically. **What’s lacking is not the technology but your imaginative automation ideas!**
