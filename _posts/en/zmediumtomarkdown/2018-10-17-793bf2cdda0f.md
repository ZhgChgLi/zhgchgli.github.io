### Exploring iOS 12 CoreML — Using Machine Learning to Automatically Predict Article Categories, Even Training the Model Itself!

Explore CoreML 2.0, how to convert or train models and apply them in real products.

Following up on the [previous article](../9a9aa892f9a9/) regarding the use of machine learning on iOS, this article officially delves into using CoreML.

First, a brief history: Apple released CoreML (which includes the Vision framework introduced in the previous article) in 2017; in 2018, CoreML 2.0 was launched, which not only [improved performance](https://www.appcoda.com.tw/core-ml-2/){:target="_blank"} but also supported **custom CoreML models**.

#### Introduction

If you've only heard the term "machine learning" but are unclear about its meaning, here's a simple explanation:

> **"Predicting the outcome of similar future events based on your past experiences."**

> For example: If I always add ketchup to my egg pancake, after a few times, the breakfast shop owner will remember, "Handsome, would you like ketchup?" I reply, "Yes" — the owner predicts correctly; if I respond, "No, because it's radish cake + egg pancake" — the owner remembers and corrects their understanding the next time the same situation arises.

> Input data: egg pancake, cheese egg pancake, egg pancake + radish cake, radish cake, egg

> Output data: add ketchup / do not add ketchup

> Model: the owner's memory and judgment

Actually, my understanding of machine learning is purely theoretical, and I have not delved deeply into it. If there are any errors, please feel free to correct me.

Speaking of this, I must pay homage to the Apple gods 🛐 for productizing machine learning, allowing anyone to operate it with just a basic understanding, without needing a vast knowledge base, thus lowering the entry barrier. It was only after I implemented this example that I first felt a tangible connection to machine learning, which sparked my great interest in this field.

#### Getting Started

The first step, of course, is the "model" mentioned earlier. Where does the model come from?

There are three ways:
- Find pre-trained models online and convert them to CoreML format.

The [Awesome-CoreML-Models](https://github.com/likedan/Awesome-CoreML-Models){:target="_blank"} GitHub project collects many pre-trained models.

For model conversion, refer to the [official website](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/build-run-models/){:target="_blank"} or online resources.
- Apple’s [Machine Learning website](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/build-run-models/){:target="_blank"} has a section at the bottom for Download Core ML Models, where you can download models that Apple has trained for us (mainly for learning or testing purposes).
- **Use tools to train your own model🏆.**

#### So, what can we do?
- Image recognition **🏆**
- **Text content classification🏆**
- Word segmentation
- Language detection
- Noun recognition

For word segmentation, refer to [Natural Language Processing in iOS Apps: An Introduction to NSLinguisticTagger](https://www.appcoda.com.tw/nslinguistictagger/){:target="_blank"}.

### Today's Main Focus — Text Content Classification + **Training Your Own Model**

In simple terms, we provide the machine with "text content" and "categories" to train the computer to classify future data. For example: "Click to view the latest offers!" or "Get $1000 shopping credit now" => "Advertisement"; "Alan sent you a message" or "Your account is about to expire" => "Important matters."

Practical applications: spam detection, label generation, classification prediction.

_p.s. Since I haven't thought of what to train for image recognition, I haven't researched it; interested friends can check out [this article](https://www.jianshu.com/p/28ed4eff68d1){:target="_blank"} where the official GUI training tool for images is provided, which is very convenient!!_

```markdown
**Required Tools:** MacOS Mojave⬆ \+ Xcode 10

**Training Tool:** [BlankSpace007/TextClassiferPlayground](https://github.com/BlankSpace007/TextClassiferPlayground){:target="_blank"} (The official tool only provides **a GUI training tool for images**; you need to write your own for text; this is a third-party tool provided by an online expert.)
#### Preparing Training Data:

![Data structure as shown in the image, supports .json, .csv files](/assets/793bf2cdda0f/1*bqKGHErvqhd6gIKCnvve4Q.png)

The data structure is as shown in the image, supporting .json and .csv files.

Prepare the data you want to use for training; here, we will export the training data using Phpmyadmin (Mysql).
```sql
SELECT `title` AS `text`,`type` AS `label` FROM `posts` WHERE `status` = '1'
```

![Change the export format to JSON](/assets/793bf2cdda0f/1*fc10j10OzmI2TGemaqlDmw.png)

Change the export format to JSON.
```json
[
  {"type":"header","version":"4.7.5","comment":"Export to JSON plugin for PHPMyAdmin"},
  {"type":"database","name":"db"},
  {"type":"table","name":"posts","database":"db","data":
    // Remove the above
    [
      {
         "label":"",
         "text":""
      }
    ]
    // Remove the below
  }
]
```

Open the downloaded JSON file and keep only the content in the middle DATA structure.
#### Using the Training Tool:

After downloading the training tool, click on TextClassifer.playground to open the Playground.

![Click the red box to execute -> Click the green box to switch view display](/assets/793bf2cdda0f/1*ct9AHpetBuEKHDGfRwvMlg.png)

Click the red box to execute -> Click the green box to switch view display.

![Drag the JSON file into the GUI tool](/assets/793bf2cdda0f/1*kV_Dh2pP94gUakcmYcI6bQ.png)

Drag the JSON file into the GUI tool.

![Open the console below to check the training progress; seeing the line "Test Accuracy" means the model training is complete](/assets/793bf2cdda0f/1*NIyGqbNaArovIDEPK6Ynhg.png)

Open the console below to check the training progress; seeing the line "Test Accuracy" means the model training is complete.

If the data is too large, it will test your computer's processing capability.

![Fill in the basic information and click "Save"](/assets/793bf2cdda0f/1*-jN91i4v0ijo6_qkCH1qwg.png)

Fill in the basic information and click "Save."

Save the trained model file.

![CoreML model file](/assets/793bf2cdda0f/1*WWg3yfrgNastu0U20iiCUQ.png)

CoreML model file.

At this point, your model has been trained! Isn't it easy?

**Specific Training Method:**
1. First, segment the input sentences (e.g., I want to know what to prepare for the wedding => I want, to know, wedding, need, prepare, what), and then see what its classification is to perform a series of machine learning calculations.
2. Group the training data, for example: 80% is used for training and the other 20% is used for testing and validation.

At this point, most of the work is done; next, just add the model file to the iOS project and write a few lines of code.

![Drag the model file (*.mlmodel) into the project](/assets/793bf2cdda0f/1*4Uc1elBmhEnQ-J8z_RIQHQ.png)

Drag the model file (*.mlmodel) into the project.
#### Code Section:
```swift
import CoreML

//
if #available(iOS 12.0, *), let prediction = try? textClassifier().prediction(text: "Text content to predict") {
    let type = prediction.label
    print("I think it is...\(type)")
}
```

**Done!**
#### Questions to Explore:
1. Can it support re-learning?
2. Can the mlmodel file be converted to other platforms?
3. Can models be trained on iOS?
```

The three points mentioned above are currently found to be ineffective.  
#### Conclusion:

I am currently applying it in a practical APP to predict its category when posting articles.

![[Wedding APP](https://itunes.apple.com/tw/app/%E7%B5%90%E5%A9%9A%E5%90%A7-%E4%B8%8D%E6%89%BE%E6%9C%80%E8%B2%B4-%E5%8F%AA%E6%89%BE%E6%9C%80%E5%B0%8D/id1356057329?ls=1&mt=8){:target="_blank"}](/assets/793bf2cdda0f/1*pOYPHRwPNLVtikVKzfIqsw.png)

[Wedding APP](https://itunes.apple.com/tw/app/%E7%B5%90%E5%A9%9A%E5%90%A7-%E4%B8%8D%E6%89%BE%E6%9C%80%E8%B2%B4-%E5%8F%AA%E6%89%BE%E6%9C%80%E5%B0%8D/id1356057329?ls=1&mt=8){:target="_blank"}

I have only about 100 samples for training data, and the current prediction accuracy is around 35%, mainly for experimental purposes.

It's that simple; I completed my first machine learning project in life. There is still a long way to learn how the background works, and I hope this project can inspire everyone!
