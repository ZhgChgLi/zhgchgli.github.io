### Unboxing the Apple Watch Series 4: Comprehensive Insights from Purchase to Use \(Updated on 2020–10–24\)

Why buy it? Is it useful? What are its advantages? How to use it? & Recommended WatchOS Apps

#### [\[Latest\] Unboxing the Apple Watch Series 6 & Two-Year Experience Insights &gt;&gt;&gt; Click here](../eab0e984043/)
### Starting from Purchase…
#### Personal Background

First, let me share my background with Apple products. I am not a die-hard Apple fan; my first encounter was in 2015 when I bought an iPhone 6 with my part-time job salary. Due to work requirements, I only started using a MacOS computer (Mac Mini) last year and purchased my own MacBook Pro and upgraded to an iPhone 8 this year. The reasons I entered the Apple ecosystem are:
1. Work necessity (developing iOS apps requires MacOS devices)
2. Work efficiency (better stability, app switching, and user experience, along with seamless integration and data synchronization between iPhone and MacOS)
3. Battery life, portability, and Retina display

\[Updated on 2019–05–02\]: Another device added to the Apple ecosystem, [AirPods 2 \(for unboxing and hands-on experience, click here\)](../33afa0ae557d/)
#### Why Did I Want to Buy an Apple Watch?
1. To track exercise and heart rate
2. To run without carrying my phone
3. To reduce phone usage time while still receiving important notifications
4. To avoid pulling out my phone or using Apple Pay when carrying bags
5. For automatic unlocking of my MacBook (my MacBook Pro is the non-Touch Bar version, and entering the password is quite tedious)
6. To check navigation while biking
7. It's trendy! I haven't used one before and wanted to try it out
8. I want to develop WatchOS apps

### Choosing the Right One…

Considering the above factors, I began selecting the suitable Apple Watch. Excluding the strap material, there are three versions of the body to choose from:
1. Aluminum case + potentially scratchable glass surface + GPS = $12,900 \(40mm\) / $13,900 \(44mm\)
2. Aluminum case + potentially scratchable glass surface + GPS + cellular = $16,500 \(40mm\) / $17,500 \(44mm\)
3. Stainless steel case + sapphire crystal glass + GPS + cellular = $22,900 \(40mm\) / $24,900 \(44mm\)

I personally bought **2. Aluminum case + potentially scratchable glass surface + GPS + cellular 44 mm**
#### About the Watch Face:
#### **Size**

There are two sizes: 40mm and 44mm. The actual choice should depend on the size of your wrist; if it's too large, it may not fit well, and heart rate detection may be inaccurate; if it's too small, it may look odd.

![Left 44mm/Right 40mm \(Thanks to my colleague for the support\)](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*FZh7TIgs139thXO7RgrdVQ.jpeg)

Left 44mm/Right 40mm \(Thanks to my colleague for the support\)

![If you can't find something to compare, you can use a disposable contact lens case as a rough comparison for about 44mm \(actual measurement 44.5mm\)](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*uqIFhXzpNmaVLgb2tXg72Q.jpeg)

If you can't find something to compare, you can use a disposable contact lens case as a rough comparison for about 44mm \(actual measurement 44.5mm\)

Here’s a picture of my hand for reference. If you're still unsure about the size, it's best to visit an Apple Store to try it on (I initially aimed for the 40mm, but after trying it on, I realized it was too small…).

**\*The Apple Watch 3 38mm and Apple Watch 4 40mm share the same strap size.**  
**\*The Apple Watch 3 42mm and Apple Watch 4 44mm share the same strap size.**
#### **Case Material**

There are two options: aluminum case + potentially scratchable glass surface and stainless steel case + sapphire crystal glass. If your budget allows, I recommend choosing the latter; personally, due to budget constraints, I had to go with the former. Why choose the stainless steel case + sapphire crystal glass version?

1. Although it is heavier (you may feel it during exercise), it blends better with outfits. Leather or metal straps paired with the stainless steel body can create a more consistent aesthetic with business attire; switching to a sporty strap during casual or workout times still looks elegant, allowing for both movement and stillness!

2. The sapphire crystal glass eliminates worries about scratches on the watch face (personal experience: my previous iPhone 6 was used without a case for over a year; I didn't particularly damage it, just kept it in my pocket and on the table; the screen ended up scratched, but the camera part remained intact due to the sapphire glass).

However, I bought the standard version… If you search online for articles about Apple Watch screen protectors, you'll find two camps: one supports using a protector, believing that it will scratch; the other opposes it, arguing that it's a matter of usage habits and that it's not that fragile. Have you seen Rolex watches with screen protectors?  
Or if you're a laid-back user who just wants to use it as a consumable product, then you won't have this concern.

I personally have a bit of OCD and get annoyed by scratches, so I support using a screen protector. Usage habits? I think only collisions can be attributed to poor habits; everyday dust damage is hard to prevent.

If you also want to use a screen protector, here's my advice: "Spend a little more to have someone else apply it." Generally, I apply my phone protectors myself, but why should you have someone else apply it for the Apple Watch?

This part stressed me out. First, I bought a tempered glass protector from Pchome for Tokyo use (\$399), but it only had adhesive on the edges, leaving a hollow space in the middle that didn't fit, making touch super unresponsive (I seriously doubt if the manufacturer tested it?). So I peeled it off immediately.

My second attempt was to buy a soft film (\$100 for two pieces) that was fully adhesive and fit well, but it was difficult to apply and prone to bubbles; both pieces had some bubbles that were quite bothersome, and it wasn't oil or water-resistant, making it inconvenient to use.

In the end, I spent \$990 to have someone apply a high-quality jelly glass protector, which fit perfectly, had no bubbles, covered the entire screen, and was oil and water-resistant.

**If you still want to try applying a protector yourself, you can look for a water-based film.**

![The feel after applying the protector is certainly not as good as the original (I feel it's about 97 out of 100), and the screen will be slightly raised; the choice is up to personal preference!](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*j6mLCaUqhWNr_7e8Wf5BIw.png)

The feel after applying the protector is certainly not as good as the original (I feel it's about 97 out of 100), and the screen will be slightly raised; the choice is up to personal preference!

3. The stainless steel case is more resistant to impacts and scratches can be polished again. I've seen my colleague's stainless steel version looking as good as new with no scratches; I personally don't mind the case part, but those who care might consider getting a protector (?)

![Stainless steel version \(Thanks to my colleague for the support\)](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*n_W9SLmBluwRxuVsHm5W_Q.jpeg)

Stainless steel version \(Thanks to my colleague for the support\)

So for those with a sufficient budget, I still recommend upgrading to the stainless steel version.
#### About Choosing a Protective Case:

Screen protectors can easily crack at the edges. Without a protective case, I found that on average, my protectors would get damaged and crack within a month, costing \$990 each… I previously replaced three, which was quite frustrating; now that I use a protective case, it has been four months, and it's still in perfect condition!

> I recommend "at least using a frame protective case," any brand will do.

> My blood and tears lesson can be summed up in one sentence: if I had known about protective cases earlier, I wouldn't have wasted so much money!

#### Should You Buy the Cellular Version?

I hold a reserved attitude on this; I personally bought the cellular version so I wouldn't have to carry my phone while running. Considering I plan to wear it for 2-3 years and am unsure about the future, I decided to upgrade. However, if your budget is limited and you won't leave home without your phone, you can just buy the WiFi version (a price difference of \$3600). Please consider the following points:
1. Currently, Spotify does not support offline playback, so you'll still need to bring your phone for music while exercising \(as of 2018/11/21\).  
p.s. Apple Music/KKBOX supports offline playback, so there's no issue there.
2. There aren't many Apple Watch apps, and the things you can do are limited to making calls, replying to messages, responding to Line/Facebook Messenger, and using Apple Pay—nothing more.  
\*Apple Pay can be used offline without needing the cellular version.
3. Using cellular requires an additional application and a monthly fee of \$199 \(with a promotional price of \$149 if applied before 2018/12/31\), and the data plan will consume your existing phone plan.
4. The cellular operation method means the watch transmits data through the telecom network to the phone, which then sends it out, so your **phone must be powered on to use the watch.**  
**\*So if your phone is dead or turned off… the watch won't work, even if you have cellular.**

[**\[Updated on 2020–10–24\]**: Spotify now supports independent playback. In the watch's Spotify app, select the playback device -> Apple Watch -> connect to Bluetooth headphones -> and you can play! (Still does not support offline download playback; you need an internet connection to use it).](../eab0e984043/)

### Purchase

Last week \(2018/11/11\), I went to the 101 store but couldn't find what I wanted, so I ordered online with shipping from China. I placed the order on 11/11, it shipped on 11/12, and was delivered on 11/15:

### Unboxing

I was so excited when I received it that I opened it right away without documenting the process. For unboxing references, you can check online: [Apple Watch Series 4 Experience: A Full-Screen Watch, Is It You?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXIEOhI-buM){:target="_blank"} [？](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXIEOhI-buM){:target="_blank"} [\(China\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXIEOhI-buM){:target="_blank"} 、 [Complete Unboxing of Apple Watch Series 4!

![Here's an unboxing photo](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*64PZhi7_5S8ytmM1s1Wblg.jpeg)

Here's an unboxing photo

That concludes the purchase section…  
### Getting Started

I won't go into detail about pairing and basic settings here; you can refer to the unboxing section above. This assumes you've set everything up and are ready to start using the Apple Watch.

![Here's a button diagram — [Apple Official Support Center](https://support.apple.com/zh-tw/HT205552){:target="_blank"}](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*qNlLQb-sqqPPimwF5b1Wvw.png)

Here's a button diagram — [Apple Official Support Center](https://support.apple.com/zh-tw/HT205552){:target="_blank"}

“Digital Crown” = “Digital Crown”  
“Side Button” = “Side Button”

**Button Operations:**
1. Tap the digital crown to switch between the home screen and watch face.
2. Double-tap the digital crown to switch to the most recently opened app.
3. Tap the side button to bring up the Dock (multitasking window), which can be set to show recently opened apps or your favorite apps \(open the "Watch" app on your iPhone -> "My Watch" page -> Dock -> Dock Arrangement\).
4. Double-tap the side button to bring up Apple Pay, which will allow for direct payment.
p.s. To change the default card for Apple Pay, open the "Watch" app on your iPhone -> "My Watch" page -> Wallet & Apple Pay -> Transaction Defaults -> Default Card -> select your preferred card.  
\*You cannot change the order; you can only designate one card as the default to be placed first.
5. Long press the side button to bring up the system menu for "Power Off" or "Restart," display the medical ID, or call emergency SOS.

#### Apple Watch Screenshot Function

This is very important, so I'll mention it first: how to take a screenshot on the Apple Watch:  
Open the "Watch" app on your iPhone -> "My Watch" page -> go to "General" -> "Enable Screenshots" to turn it on.

![](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*Za5IVCeJy_kEwoprlvgWkA.png)

On the Apple Watch, simultaneously press the digital crown and the side button; when you see a flash effect on the screen, the screenshot is complete. You can then open your iPhone to find the screenshot in your photos!

#### Speaker

The watch has a built-in speaker that can only be used for calls; it cannot play music or alerts. If you feel that everyone can hear you when talking on the watch, you can use Bluetooth headphones.
#### Explanation of Various Icons

[Please refer to the official documentation](https://support.apple.com/zh-tw/HT205550){:target="_blank"}
#### Connection Between Apple Watch and iPhone

The watch uses Bluetooth when near the phone; when too far, it uses WiFi.

![Left indicates a disconnected state, right indicates a normal connection](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*2kbJd75Qi81C1ihia0lLbw.jpeg)

Left indicates a disconnected state, right indicates a normal connection.
#### Notifications from iPhone Apps to Apple Watch



```markdown
---
title: Apple Watch User Guide
---

The watch is preset to use the notification settings of the apps on your iPhone, and you can specifically turn off notifications for certain apps so they don't get sent to the watch (open the "Watch" app on your iPhone -> "My Watch" page -> "Notifications" -> scroll to the bottom to adjust settings for each app).
- If an app does not appear on this list, it means that notifications for that app are not enabled on your iPhone (please go to "Settings" on your iPhone -> "Notifications" -> enable notifications for that app).
- Why do some notifications have sounds/vibrations while others do not?
This setting follows the notification settings of the apps on your iPhone; if the app's "Notifications" has "Sounds" enabled, it will have sound and vibration.
- Most app notifications only support viewing, while some allow for interaction (for example, Line notifications can be clicked to reply on the watch).
- **Notifications will only alert you when your wrist is raised and you are wearing the watch; the phone will not ring, but notifications will still appear in the notification center. This prevents both the phone and watch from ringing at the same time.**

#### Apps that Support Apple Watch
- By default, when you install an app that supports Apple Watch, it will also be installed on the Apple Watch (you can turn off "Automatic App Install" from the "Watch" app on your iPhone -> "My Watch" page -> "General").
- Can you install only the Apple Watch app?
No, currently you cannot install the Apple Watch app independently; there must be an app on the iPhone.
- Don't want to install the Apple Watch version of the app?
From the "Watch" app on your iPhone -> "My Watch" page -> scroll down to the "Installed on APPLE WATCH" section, tap in -> turn off "Show App on Apple Watch."
- **When an app states it supports "Complications," it means it supports watch face widgets.**

#### Watch Face Design
Feel free to customize it however you like; what information you find important or how you want it to look is up to you. I put "information I always want to know when I look at my watch" on the watch face, and you can also add multiple watch faces for switching.

#### Flashlight
You read that right, the Apple Watch also has a flashlight! On the watch face page, swipe up from the bottom to find the "Flashlight" icon button. Once inside, you can swipe left and right to change the screen color; yes, it's just the screen highlighting in color!

![](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*Sg-RRk8JWIdnh5STgbpoVA.jpeg)

Interestingly, there is also a strobe mode:

[![Apple Watch S4 FlashLight](/assets/a2920e33e73e/88b9_hqdefault.jpg "Apple Watch S4 FlashLight")](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__vGQDSBsik){:target="_blank"}

Making nighttime activities safer!

#### Various Modes
- **Silent Mode** - All notifications are silenced, no vibrations, and the screen does not light up; they only appear in the notification center.
- **Theater Mode** - Raising your wrist will not wake the screen; you must tap the screen to wake it.
- **Water Lock** - The screen touch is locked; you must rotate the Digital Crown to unlock it. After unlocking, the speaker will automatically play sounds to expel water.
- **Airplane Mode** - Turns off all external connections.
- **Power Saving Mode** - Really saves battery! Only the time display function remains when pressing the Digital Crown; everything else is completely off, almost equivalent to being turned off. Alarms and countdown functions will still sound in this mode ("Power Saving Mode will force the watch to turn on").

In all of the above modes, alarms and countdown functions will still sound.

#### Raise Wrist to Call Siri Directly
Just raise your wrist, and when the screen lights up, you can speak to use Siri! No need to say "Hey! Siri" (for example, after raising your hand, just say **“Tomorrow's weather”**). You can also use Siri when your phone is a distance away (for example, when hanging out laundry).

\[Updated 2019–05–02\]: Want an enhanced Siri experience? Please refer to the Siri section in [AirPods 2 Unboxing and Hands-On Experience](../33afa0ae557d/) where Siri can be used directly with the headphones, without even raising your wrist.

#### AQI Air Quality Not Displaying?
The built-in AQI seems not to support the Taiwan region. You need to search for "Air Quality" in the "App Store," download and install it, then open it. After that, go to the watch face design complications section and select "Air Quality."

#### Unlock Mac with Apple Watch
1. Ensure your iPhone/Apple Watch/Mac are logged into the same Apple ID.
2. Ensure your Apple ID has [Two-Factor Authentication](https://support.apple.com/zh-tw/HT205075){:target="_blank"} enabled.
3. Once the system detects your Apple ID has an Apple Watch device, it will add a line in "System Preferences" -> "Security & Privacy" -> "General" -> "Allow your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac" -> "Check it."

If activation keeps failing, please confirm that your Apple ID has Two-Factor Authentication enabled (not [Two-Step Verification](https://support.apple.com/zh-tw/HT207198){:target="_blank"}), or try restarting your computer!

p.s. My company's Mac Mini had trouble activating, but it worked fine after a restart.

#### Photos Opening Blank?
By default, it shows the favorites from your iPhone. Open the "Photos" app on your iPhone and tap the "heart" on the photos you want to send to the watch, and they will appear.

#### Activity Records and Fitness Training
The activity record has three rings and three goals each day:
1. Stand (blue): Standing for at least 1 minute each hour counts as one achievement.
2. Move (red): Only activities that exceed brisk walking intensity will be counted.
3. Exercise (green): The number of active calories burned increases as you move.

You can find detailed explanations in the "Health" app on your iPhone.

Daily achievement records will prompt you, and you can also adjust your activity goal values in the "Activity" app on the Apple Watch (the default daily activity goal is 360 calories).

For fitness training, I use Nike Run Club for running and did not use the built-in one. Last week, I tried the built-in fitness training -> "Outdoor Cycling" to record, which tracks elevation/distance/time/path/heart rate. Awesome!

![](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*WScZTP6ySKIdbpYZ17tY2A.jpeg)

#### Map Function?
Currently, it only supports Apple Maps; Google Maps is temporarily unsupported. Open "Maps" to search or select your personal information settings for your company or home address (source: contact information -> my card) or input your destination manually. Once navigation starts, each turn is a card that automatically switches based on your route. You can rotate to view, and when you're 40 meters away, it will vibrate to alert you. Pressing hard can end navigation.

![](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*xc0BTmLpRFDkRQhUeMz-tQ.jpeg)

This feature simply transmits your phone's Apple Maps information to the watch (when the watch navigates, the phone's navigation will also automatically open).

Actual usage feedback: Apple Maps has very few landmarks and is hard to search; it seems to only guide major roads, even when there are faster routes with double lanes and no traffic... So I still hope for an update to Google Maps; for now, I'll use this feature sparingly.

**Here's a Siri shortcut: [Open Google Maps Items Using Apple Maps](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4323b1653c6e4df2a1652535e7489773){:target="_blank"}**

![](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*mIQkQp3UGQ_PAofH3gLcJQ.gif)

#### Bluetooth Camera Button
When you open "Camera" on the Apple Watch, the phone's camera will also open, allowing you to control the phone's camera for taking photos or recording videos. Pressing hard allows you to switch lenses/settings.

![](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*nM3Vmpra-U8-daBnLfkhUw.jpeg)

#### Where's My Phone?
On the watch face page, swipe up from the bottom to find the "Phone vibrating icon." Clicking it will make your phone emit a sound!

![](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*YjJwm9uJtLxb4RoK2LvM5w.png)

- The phone will still emit a sound even if it is on silent or do not disturb mode.
- Pressing hard on the icon will not only make the phone emit a sound but also flash the flashlight.

p.s. Unfortunately, there is no feature to find the watch from the phone. If you lose it, please use "Find My iPhone" to locate it.

#### Unable to Recognize Handwritten Chinese Characters or Voice Input in Chinese?
I think this is a bug...

![In messages, press and hold the "Microphone" or "Handwriting" icon to bring up the menu > "Select Language" -> "Chinese"](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*KjBwFaHI3Aw894vw8RN3kw.jpeg)

In messages, press and hold the "Microphone" or "Handwriting" icon to bring up the menu > "Select Language" -> "Chinese."

Another method is to open "iPhone" -> "Settings" -> "General" -> "Keyboard" -> "Dictation" -> "Dictation Language" -> only check "Mandarin."

This way, your voice input will only recognize Mandarin, and the phone will be affected as well.

#### Turn Off Breathing Reminders / Turn Off Stand Reminders
Open the "Watch" app on your iPhone -> "My Watch" page -> Breathing -> turn off Breathing Reminders.

Open the "Watch" app on your iPhone -> "My Watch" page -> Activity -> turn off Stand Reminders.

#### Want to Set a More Complex Password for the Watch?
Open the "Watch" app on your iPhone -> "My Watch" page -> Passcode -> Simple Passcode -> turn off -> then you can set a 6-digit passcode.

#### Can the Watch Display Whoscall Information for Incoming Calls?
No.

#### Does it Lag?
In actual comparison with a colleague's Apple Watch S3, the S4 opens apps almost instantly without loading, and it boots up quickly. You can refer to this video for real-world testing: [Latest Apple Watch Series 4 Speed Test Volume Comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1bJjOiUUs){:target="_blank"}.

#### Does it Drain Battery?
I wear it only from getting up until before showering, and I don't wear it to bed (the bed is against the wall, so I worry about hitting the wall unconsciously). I take it off to charge before showering.
- Charged fully at midnight and took it off, and by 8 AM the next day, it was about 95% remaining.
- Charged fully at midnight and took it off, **switched to Airplane Mode**, and by 8 AM the next day, it was about 98% remaining.

After wearing it for about 15 hours throughout the day, if I don't use it excessively, it will have about 65% battery left, which is quite good; it can barely last two days on a single charge.

\* The first charge may take longer.
\* The battery performance may not be optimal in the first few days and may drain faster.

I have tried this one and C*Money, but C*Money costs $120 and has a too complicated interface for personal use; hence I recommend this one more.
3. [Bus+](https://itunes.apple.com/tw/app/bus-%E5%85%A8%E5%8F%B0%E5%85%AC%E8%BB%8A%E5%8B%95%E6%85%8B-ubike-%E6%9F%A5%E8%A9%A2/id967861325?mt=8){:target="_blank"} (Free): Queries bus information. I originally used Taipei Bus but that app does not support Apple Watch, so I had to reluctantly abandon it. Bus+ operates differently from Taipei Bus; it is based on stops. My personal setup is to categorize frequently used locations (home/company/subway station) and add the bus routes that pass through them.

Line, Spotify, etc.

### Summary and One-Week Experience
Having worn it for almost two weeks now, the initial novelty has faded, and it has seamlessly integrated into my life. So far, the benefits I feel in my daily life include: unlocking my Mac without typing a lengthy password (my company requires logging out when leaving the desk), checking the weather in real-time, looking at navigation, app notifications, and monitoring my heart rate for health concerns; that's about it. The supported apps and functions are indeed too few.

Has my phone usage time decreased? Not particularly; I still prefer to reply to notifications on my phone, as responding on the watch requires voice input... in public... and handwriting is very slow. Furthermore, many apps do not support Apple Watch.

Is it really worth starting at $12,900? There are many better options for watches over ten thousand, but if you want to connect with the entire Apple ecosystem, there’s only one choice. If you simply want a luxury watch, then there's no need to use the Apple Watch; if you want a watch that can handle daily trivialities, you might consider it; if you want a luxury item that also handles daily trivialities, you might consider stainless steel or even the Hermès version!

購買至今曾經有想退掉的念頭，總覺得$17,500能做很多事，花在一隻手錶上好像不太值得，但他的確又對日常生活是有幫助的，這個幫助值不值$17,500呢？我覺得目前不值，等Apple Watch APP生態系更有規模一點再來評估了，目前就是奢侈品XD，因為爽、潮、衝動所以買．

其他項目就等大家自行體會囉
