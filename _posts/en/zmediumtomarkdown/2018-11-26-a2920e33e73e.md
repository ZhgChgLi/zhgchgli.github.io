### Apple Watch Series 4 Unboxing Comprehensive Insights from Purchase to Usage \(Updated on 2020–10–24\)

Why buy it? Is it useful? What are its advantages? How to use it? & Recommended WatchOS Apps

#### [\[Latest\] Apple Watch Series 6 Unboxing & Two-Year Experience Insights &gt;&gt;&gt; Click here to proceed](../eab0e984043/)
### Starting from the Purchase…
#### Personal Background

First, let me share my background with Apple products. I am not a die-hard Apple fan; my first encounter was in 2015 when I bought an iPhone 6 with my part-time job salary. Due to work requirements, I only started using a MacOS computer (Mac Mini) last year and purchased my own MacBook Pro and upgraded to an iPhone 8 this year. The reasons I entered the Apple ecosystem are:
1. Work necessity (developing iOS apps requires MacOS devices)
2. Work efficiency (better stability, app switching, and user experience, along with the seamless integration and data synchronization between iPhone and MacOS, simplifies many tasks)
3. Battery life, portability, Retina display

\[Updated on 2019–05–02\]: Another device added to the Apple ecosystem, [AirPods 2 \(For unboxing and hands-on experience, click here\)](../33afa0ae557d/)
#### Why I Wanted to Buy an Apple Watch?
1. To track exercise and heart rate
2. To run without carrying my phone
3. To reduce phone usage time while still receiving important information
4. To avoid pulling out my phone or using Apple Pay when carrying bags
5. To unlock my MacBook automatically (my MacBook Pro is the non-Touch Bar version, and entering the password is quite tedious)
6. To view navigation while biking
7. It's trendy! I haven't used one before and want to try it out
8. I want to develop WatchOS apps

### Starting the Selection Process…

Considering the above factors, I began to choose a suitable Apple Watch. Excluding the strap material, there are three versions of the body to choose from:
1. Aluminum case + potentially scratchable glass surface + GPS = $12,900 (40mm) / $13,900 (44mm)
2. Aluminum case + potentially scratchable glass surface + GPS + cellular = $16,500 (40mm) / $17,500 (44mm)
3. Stainless steel case + sapphire crystal glass + GPS + cellular = $22,900 (40mm) / $24,900 (44mm)

I personally purchased **2. Aluminum case + potentially scratchable glass surface + GPS + cellular 44 mm**
#### Regarding the Watch Face:
#### **Size**

There are two sizes: 40mm and 44mm. The actual choice should depend on the size of your wrist; if it's too large, it may not fit well, and heart rate detection may be inaccurate; if it's too small, it may look odd.

![Left 44mm/Right 40mm \(Thanks to my colleague for the support\)](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*FZh7TIgs139thXO7RgrdVQ.jpeg)

Left 44mm/Right 40mm \(Thanks to my colleague for the support\)

![If you can't find something to compare, you can use a disposable contact lens case for comparison, approximately = 44mm \(actual measurement 44.5mm\)](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*uqIFhXzpNmaVLgb2tXg72Q.jpeg)

If you can't find something to compare, you can use a disposable contact lens case for comparison, approximately = 44mm \(actual measurement 44.5mm\)

Here’s a picture of my hand for reference. If you’re still unsure about the size, it’s best to visit the 101 store to try it on (I initially aimed for 40mm, but after trying it on, I found it too small…).

**\*Apple Watch 3 38mm and Apple Watch 4 40mm share the same strap size**  
**\*Apple Watch 3 42mm and Apple Watch 4 44mm share the same strap size**
#### **Case Material**

There are aluminum cases + potentially scratchable glass surfaces and stainless steel cases + sapphire crystal glass. Friends with sufficient budget are certainly advised to choose the latter; personally, due to budget constraints, I had to choose the former. Why choose the stainless steel case + sapphire crystal glass version?

1. Although the body is relatively heavy (which you might feel during exercise), it is easier to match with outfits in daily life. A leather or metal strap paired with a sleek body can create a more consistent aesthetic when worn with business attire; switching to a sporty strap during casual or athletic activities maintains elegance, allowing for both movement and stillness!

2. The sapphire hard glass means you don't have to worry about scratching the watch face (personal experience: my previous iPhone 6 was used without a case for over a year; I didn't particularly damage it, just kept it in my pocket and on the table; the screen is scratched up, but the camera part, made of sapphire hard glass, remains intact).

However, I bought the standard version... If you search online for articles about Apple Watch screen protectors, you'll find two camps: one that supports using a protector because they believe it will scratch, and another that argues it's a matter of usage habits, claiming it's not that fragile and won't scratch—have you seen a Rolex with a screen protector? Or if you're a laid-back user who buys it just to use, as a consumable product, then you won't have this concern.

Personally, I have a bit of OCD and get annoyed by scratches, so I support using a screen protector; is it a usage habit issue? I think only collisions indicate poor usage habits; everyday dust damage is indeed hard to prevent.

If you also want to use a screen protector, here's a suggestion: "Spend a little more money to have someone apply it." Generally, I apply my phone protectors myself, so why do I say the Apple Watch should be done by someone else?

This part has been quite exhausting for me. First, I bought a tempered glass protector for Tokyo* from Pchome ($399), which only had adhesive on the edges. Once applied, it created a hollow state in the middle, not fitting well, making touch super unresponsive (seriously doubting if the manufacturer ever tested it?), so I peeled it off immediately.

My second attempt was to buy g*r soft film ($100 for two pieces), which is fully adhesive and fits well, but the soft material is hard to apply and easily bubbles; I tried both pieces, and there were still some annoying bubbles, plus it doesn't repel oil or water, making it inconvenient to use.

Finally, I spent $990 to have someone apply a (x luxury film) h*a jelly glass protector, which fits well, has no bubbles, covers the entire screen, and repels oil and water.

**If you still want to try applying a protector yourself, you can look for a water gel film.**

![The feel after applying the protector is certainly not as good as the original (I personally feel it's about 97 out of 100), and the screen will be slightly higher; the trade-off depends on personal preference!](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*j6mLCaUqhWNr_7e8Wf5BIw.png)

The feel after applying the protector is certainly not as good as the original (I personally feel it's about 97 out of 100), and the screen will be slightly higher; the trade-off depends on personal preference!

3. The stainless steel case is more resistant to impacts and scratches and can be polished again. Looking at my colleague's stainless steel version, it remains as good as new with no scratches; I care less about the case itself, but friends who are really concerned might consider getting a film (?

![Stainless steel version (thanks to my colleague for the support)](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*n_W9SLmBluwRxuVsHm5W_Q.jpeg)

Stainless steel version (thanks to my colleague for the support)

So, for those with a sufficient budget, I still recommend upgrading to the stainless steel version.

#### Regarding the purchase of protective cases:

Screen protectors easily shatter at the edges. Without a protective case, on average, my protectors get damaged and shatter within a month for no apparent reason, costing $990 each... I've replaced three so far, almost to the point of tears; after using a protective case, it's been four months and still in perfect condition!

> I recommend "at least using a frame protective case," any brand will do.

> My blood and tears lesson can be summed up in one phrase: I wish I had known sooner; if I had known about protective cases, I wouldn't have wasted so much money!

#### Should you buy the version that supports mobile networks?

I hold a reserved attitude on this; personally, I bought the mobile network version so I wouldn't have to carry my phone while running. Considering I plan to wear it for 2-3 years and am uncertain about the future, I decided to upgrade. However, if your budget is limited and you won't forget your phone when going out, you can just buy the WiFi version (price difference of $3600). Please consider the following points:
1. Currently, Spotify does not support offline playback, so you'll still need to bring your phone for music while exercising (as of 2018/11/21).
p.s. Apple Music/KKBOX supports offline playback, so there's no issue there.
2. There aren't many Apple Watch apps, and the things you can do are limited to making calls, replying to messages, responding to Line, Facebook Messenger, and using Apple Pay—nothing more.
*Apple Pay can be used offline without needing the mobile network version.
3. Using mobile networks requires an additional application and a monthly fee of $199 (with a promotional price of $149 for applications before 2018/12/31), and the data plan uses your original phone's plan.
4. The operation of the mobile network means the watch transmits data through the telecom to the phone, which then sends it out, so your **phone must be powered on to use the watch.**
**So if your phone is out of battery and turned off... the watch cannot be used, even if you have a mobile network.**

[**\[2020–10–24 Update\]**: Spotify now supports independent playback. In the watch's Spotify app, select the playback device -> Apple Watch -> connect to Bluetooth headphones -> and you can play! (Still does not support offline download playback; it requires an internet connection to use).](../eab0e984043/)

### Purchase

Last week (2018/11/11), I actually went to 101 but didn't find what I wanted, so I ordered online with shipping from China. I placed the order on 11/11, it shipped on 11/12, and was delivered on time on 11/15:

### Unboxing


When I received it, I was so excited that I opened it right away and didn't take any notes. For the unboxing part, you can refer to the internet: [Apple Watch Series 4 Experience Full-Screen Watch, Is It You?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXIEOhI-buM){:target="_blank"} [？](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXIEOhI-buM){:target="_blank"} [\(Mainland\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXIEOhI-buM){:target="_blank"} 、 [Complete Unboxing of Apple Watch Series 4!

Add an unboxing image

This concludes the acquisition part…\.
### Getting Started

I won't elaborate on pairing and basic settings here; you can refer to the unboxing article above. Here, I assume you have everything set up and are ready to start using the Apple Watch.

![Here’s a button diagram — [Apple Support Center](https://support.apple.com/zh-tw/HT205552){:target="_blank"}](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*qNlLQb-sqqPPimwF5b1Wvw.png)

Here’s a button diagram — [Apple Support Center](https://support.apple.com/zh-tw/HT205552){:target="_blank"}

“Digital Crown” = “Digital Crown”  
“Side Button” = “Side Button”

**Button Operations:**
1. Press the Digital Crown once to switch between the home screen and watch face.
2. Double-click the Digital Crown to switch to the most recently opened app.
3. Press the side button once to bring up the Dock (multitasking window), which can be set to show recently opened apps or your favorite apps (open the "Watch" app on your iPhone -> "My Watch" page -> Dock -> Dock Arrangement).
4. Double-click the side button to bring up Apple Pay, at which point the payment will be processed directly.
p.s. To modify the default card for Apple Pay, open the "Watch" app on your iPhone -> "My Watch" page -> Wallet & Apple Pay -> Transaction Defaults -> Default Card -> select the card you want to set as default.  
* You cannot change the order; you can only designate one card as the default to be placed first.
5. Long press the side button to bring up the system menu for "Power Off" or "Restart," display the medical ID, or call emergency SOS.

#### Apple Watch Screenshot Function

This is very important, so it's placed first. Here’s how to take a screenshot on the Apple Watch:  
Open the "Watch" app on your iPhone -> "My Watch" page -> go to "General" -> "Enable Screenshots" to turn it on.

![](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*Za5IVCeJy_kEwoprlvgWkA.png)

Simultaneously press the Digital Crown and the side button on the Apple Watch; when the screen shows a flash effect, it indicates that the screenshot is complete. At this point, open your iPhone to see the screenshot photo!

#### Speaker

The built-in speaker on the watch can only be used for calls; it cannot play music or alerts. If you feel that everyone can hear you when talking on the watch, you can use Bluetooth headphones.

#### Explanation of Icon Status

[Please refer to the official documentation](https://support.apple.com/zh-tw/HT205550){:target="_blank"}

#### Connection Between Apple Watch and iPhone

The watch uses Bluetooth when near the phone; when the distance is too far, it uses Wi-Fi.

![Left indicates connection is interrupted, right indicates connection is normal](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*2kbJd75Qi81C1ihia0lLbw.jpeg)

Left indicates connection is interrupted, right indicates connection is normal.

#### Notifications from iPhone Apps to Apple Watch

By default, the watch will receive notifications from the apps on the iPhone, and you can also specifically turn off notifications from certain apps so they do not get sent to the watch (open the "Watch" app on your iPhone -> "My Watch" page -> "Notifications" -> scroll to the bottom to adjust for each app).  
- If an app does not appear on this list, it means that the app does not have notifications enabled on the iPhone (please go to "Settings" on your iPhone -> "Notifications" -> enable notifications for that app).
- Why do some notifications have sound/vibration while others do not?  
This setting follows the notification settings of the app on the iPhone; if the app's "Notifications" has "Sound" enabled, there will be sound and vibration.
- Most app notifications only support viewing, while some support actions (for example, Line notifications can be clicked to reply on the watch).
- **The watch will only show new notification alerts when the phone is not in use and the watch is being worn; the phone will not ring, but notifications will still appear in the notification center to avoid both the phone and watch ringing at the same time.**

#### When the APP supports Apple Watch
- By default, when installing the APP, if the APP supports Apple Watch, it will also be installed on the Apple Watch (you can turn off "Automatic App Install" from the "Watch" APP on your iPhone -> "My Watch" page -> "General").
- Can I install only the Apple Watch APP?
No, currently it is not possible to install the Apple Watch APP independently; there must be an APP on the iPhone.
- I don't want to install the Apple Watch version of the APP.
From the "Watch" APP on your iPhone -> "My Watch" page -> scroll down to the "Installed on APPLE WATCH" section and click in -> turn off "Show App on Apple Watch."
- **When the APP states it supports "complications," it means it supports watch face widgets.**

#### Watch Face Design

Feel free to play around and design as you wish; it's up to personal preference which information is important or how it looks. I place "the information I always want to know when I look at my watch" on the watch face, and you can also add multiple watch faces for switching.
#### Flashlight

You read that right, the Apple Watch also has a flashlight; swipe up from the bottom of the watch face page to find the "Flashlight" icon button, and once inside, you can switch the screen color left and right; yes, it's just the screen highlighting in color!

![](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*Sg-RRk8JWIdnh5STgbpoVA.jpeg)

What's special is that there is also a strobe mode:

[![Apple Watch S4 FlashLight](/assets/a2920e33e73e/88b9_hqdefault.jpg "Apple Watch S4 FlashLight")](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__vGQDSBsik){:target="_blank"}

Making nighttime activities safer!
#### Various Modes

"Silent Mode" - All notifications are silent, no vibrations, and the screen does not light up; they are only displayed in the notification center.

"Theater Mode" - Raising your hand will not wake the screen; you need to tap the screen to wake it.

"Water Lock" - The screen touch is locked; you must rotate the Digital Crown to unlock it. After unlocking, the speaker will automatically play sound to expel water.

"Airplane Mode" - Turns off all external connections.

"Power Saving Mode" - Really saves power! Only the time display function remains when pressing the Digital Crown, everything else is completely off, almost equivalent to being in a shutdown state; to exit power saving mode, press and hold the side button (same as turning it on).

In all of the above modes, alarms and countdown functions will still sound (power saving mode will force the device to turn on).
#### Raise Wrist to Call Siri Directly

Just raise your wrist, and when the screen lights up, you can speak directly to use Siri! No need to say "Hey! Siri" (e.g., after raising your hand, just say **“Tomorrow's weather”**).
You can also use Siri when your phone is a distance away from you (e.g., when hanging clothes).

\[Updated 2019–05–02\]: Want an even better Siri experience? Please refer to the Siri section in [AirPods 2 Unboxing and Hands-On Experience](../33afa0ae557d/), where Siri on AirPods 2 can be used directly with the headphones on, without even raising your wrist.
#### AQI Air Quality Not Displaying?

The built-in AQI seems not to support the Taiwan region; you need to search for "Air Quality Concern" in the "App Store" to download and install it. After opening it, go to the watch face design complications section to select "Air Quality Concern."
#### Unlock Mac Computer with Apple Watch
1. Ensure your iPhone/Apple Watch/Mac computer is logged into the same Apple account.
2. Ensure your Apple account has enabled [Two-Factor Authentication](https://support.apple.com/zh-tw/HT205075){:target="_blank"}.
3. The system will detect your Apple account has an Apple Watch device and will add a line in "System Preferences" -> "Security & Privacy" -> "General" -> "Allow your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac" -> "Check it to enable."

If activation keeps failing, please first confirm that your Apple account has enabled two-factor authentication (not [Two-Step Verification](https://support.apple.com/zh-tw/HT207198){:target="_blank"}), or try restarting your computer!

p.s. My company's Mac Mini just couldn't activate, but it worked fine after a restart.
#### Photos Opening Blank?

By default, it shows the favorites from your iPhone; open the "Photos" app on your iPhone and tap the "heart" on the photos you want to transfer to the watch, and they will appear.
#### Activity Records and Fitness Training

The activity record has three rings and three goals each day:
1. Stand (Blue): Standing for 1 minute each hour counts as one achievement.
2. Exercise (Green): Only activities that exceed brisk walking intensity will be counted.
3. Move (Red): The number of active calories burned will increase as you move.

For detailed explanations, you can check the "Health" APP on your iPhone.

Daily achievement records will prompt you, and you can also press and hold the "Activity Record" APP on the Apple Watch to adjust the activity target value (the default is 360 calories burned in a day to meet the goal).


For physical training, I use Nike Run Club for running and not the built-in one. Last week, I tried the built-in fitness training -> "Outdoor Cycling" to record data, which tracks elevation/distance/time/path/heart rate. Awesome!

![](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*WScZTP6ySKIdbpYZ17tY2A.jpeg)

#### Map Function?

Currently, it only supports Apple Maps; Google Maps is temporarily unsupported. Open "Maps" to search or select the company/home address from your personal information settings (source: Contact Information -> My Card) or input the destination manually. After starting navigation, each turn is represented by a card, automatically switching pages based on your route. It will vibrate to alert you when you are 40 meters away, and a long press can end navigation.

![](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*xc0BTmLpRFDkRQhUeMz-tQ.jpeg)

This feature simply transmits your phone's Apple Maps information to the watch (the phone's navigation will also automatically open when the watch is navigating).

Actual usage feedback: Apple Maps has very few landmarks and is hard to search. It seems to only direct you to major roads, even when there are faster, less congested routes available… So I still look forward to updates from Google Maps; for now, I’ll use this feature sparingly.

**Here’s a Siri shortcut: [Open Google Maps item using Apple Maps](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4323b1653c6e4df2a1652535e7489773){:target="_blank"}**

![](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*mIQkQp3UGQ_PAofH3gLcJQ.gif)

#### Bluetooth Camera Button

When you open "Camera" on the Apple Watch, the phone's camera will also open, allowing you to control the phone's camera for taking photos and videos from the watch. A long press will switch the lens/settings.

![](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*nM3Vmpra-U8-daBnLfkhUw.jpeg)

#### Where is my phone?

On the watch face, swipe up from the bottom to find the "phone vibrating icon." Clicking it will make your phone emit a sound!

![](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*YjJwm9uJtLxb4RoK2LvM5w.png)

- The phone will still emit a sound even when it is on silent or do not disturb mode.
- A long press on the icon will not only make the phone emit a sound but will also activate the flashlight.

p.s. Conversely, there is no function to find the watch using the phone. If lost, please search through "Find iPhone."

#### Message Input Cannot Recognize Handwritten Chinese Characters, Voice Input Also Does Not Recognize Chinese

I think this is a bug…

![In messages, long press the "microphone" or "handwriting" icon to bring up the menu > "Select Language" -> "Chinese"](/assets/a2920e33e73e/1*KjBwFaHI3Aw894vw8RN3kw.jpeg)

In messages, long press the "microphone" or "handwriting" icon to bring up the menu > "Select Language" -> "Chinese."

Another method is to open "iPhone" -> "Settings" -> "General" -> "Keyboard" -> "Dictation" -> "Dictation Language" -> only check "Mandarin."

This way, your voice input will only recognize Mandarin, and the phone will also be affected.

#### Turn Off Deep Breathing Reminders / Turn Off Stand Reminders

Open the "Watch" app on your iPhone -> "My Watch" page -> Breathing -> turn off breathing reminders.

Open the "Watch" app on your iPhone -> "My Watch" page -> Activity -> turn off stand reminders.

#### Want to Set a More Complex Password for the Watch

Open the "Watch" app on your iPhone -> "My Watch" page -> Passcode -> Simple Passcode -> turn off -> then you can set a 6-digit passcode.

#### Can the Watch Display Whoscall Information When a Call Comes In?

No.

#### Does it Lag?

In actual comparison with a colleague's Apple Watch S3, the S4 opens apps almost instantly without loading, and it boots up quickly. 

You can refer to this video for actual testing: [【Latest】Apple Watch Series 4 Speed Test Volume Comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1bJjOiUUs){:target="_blank"}

#### Does it Consume Battery?

I wear it only from getting up until before showering, and I don’t wear it to sleep (the bed is against the wall, so I’m afraid I might hit the wall unconsciously). I take it off before showering to charge it.
- Charged fully at midnight and took it off, and by 8 AM the next day, it was about 95% remaining.
- Charged fully at midnight and took it off, **switched to airplane mode**, and by 8 AM the next day, it was about 98% remaining.

After wearing it for about 15 hours throughout the day, if I don’t use it intensively, it will have about 65% battery left, which is quite good; it can barely last two days on a single charge.

* The first charge may take longer.
* The battery performance may not be optimal in the first few days, leading to higher consumption.

### Summary and One-Week Experience

It has been almost two weeks since I started wearing it. What was once a novelty has now blended into my daily life. So far, I have noticed its benefits: I can unlock my Mac without typing a lengthy password (the company requires logging out when leaving the desk), check the weather in real-time, look at navigation, receive app notifications, and monitor my heart rate for health concerns. That's about it; the supported apps and features are really too few.

Has my phone usage decreased? I don't feel any significant change because I still prefer to respond to notifications on my phone. Responding on the watch requires voice input... in public... and handwriting is very slow. Moreover, many apps do not support Apple Watch.

Is it really worth starting at $12,900? There are many better options for watches over $10,000, but if you want to connect with the entire Apple ecosystem, there is only one choice. If you simply want a luxury watch, then there's no need to use an Apple Watch. If you want a watch that can help with daily trivialities, you might consider it; if you want a luxury item that also solves daily trivialities, you might consider stainless steel or even the Hermès version!

Since purchasing, I have had thoughts of returning it, feeling that $17,500 could do a lot of things, and spending it on a watch seems not worth it. However, it does help in daily life. Is that help worth $17,500? I currently think it is not worth it. I will reassess when the Apple Watch app ecosystem becomes more robust; for now, it feels like a luxury item XD, bought out of enjoyment, trendiness, and impulse.

As for other aspects, I’ll leave it for everyone to experience on their own.

1. The full-screen protector broke when I bumped into something while doing housework (what a hassle).
