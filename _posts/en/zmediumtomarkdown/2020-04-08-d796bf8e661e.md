#### \[2023/03/12\] Update
- The next article, "[AVPlayer Complete Guide to Implementing Local Cache Functionality](../6ce488898003/)," will teach you how to implement AVPlayer caching.

I have open-sourced my previous implementation, which can be used directly by those in need.
- Customizable cache strategies, can use PINCache or others...
- Externally, just call the make AVAsset factory with the URL, and the AVAsset will support caching.
- Implemented data flow strategies using Combine.
- Wrote some tests.

### About

HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) is a streaming media network transport protocol based on HTTP proposed by Apple.

For music playback, in non-streaming situations, we use mp3 as the music file, and the time it takes to download depends on the file size; HLS splits a file into multiple smaller files, allowing playback to start as soon as the first segment is received, without needing to download the entire file!

The `.m3u8` file records the bitrate, playback order, duration, and overall audio information of these split `.ts` files. It can also provide encryption protection, low-latency live streaming, etc.

Example of an `.m3u8` file (aviciiwakemeup.m3u8):
```plaintext
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-VERSION:3
#EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:YES
#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:10
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:0
#EXTINF:9.900411,
aviciiwakemeup–00001.ts
#EXTINF:9.900400,
aviciiwakemeup–00002.ts
#EXTINF:9.900411,
aviciiwakemeup–00003.ts
#EXTINF:9.900411,
.
.
.
#EXTINF:6.269389,
aviciiwakemeup-00028.ts
#EXT-X-ENDLIST
```

_\*EXT\-X\-ALLOW\-CACHE has been deprecated in [iOS≥ 8/Protocol Ver\.7](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/about_the_ext-x-version_tag?language=objc){:target="_blank"} and is no longer meaningful whether this line exists or not._
### Goal

For a streaming media service, **caching is extremely important**; since each audio file can range from MB to several GB, if every replay requires downloading the file again from the server, it puts a significant load on the server, and data costs money. A caching layer can save a lot of money for the service and prevent users from wasting bandwidth and time re-downloading; it's a win-win mechanism (but remember to set limits/timely cleanups to avoid overwhelming users' devices).
### Problem

In the past, non-streaming mp3/mp4 files were straightforward to handle; just download them to the device before playback, starting playback only after the download was complete. Since you had to download the entire file to play it, why not just use URLSession to download the file and then feed the local file path to AVPlayer for playback? Alternatively, you could use the proper method, utilizing AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate to cache the downloaded data in the delegate methods.

When it comes to streaming, the idea is quite simple: read the `.m3u8` file, parse the information inside, and cache each `.ts` file. However, I found that the implementation was not as straightforward as I imagined, and the complexity exceeded my expectations, which is why this article was written!

For playback, we still use the iOS AVFoundation's AVPlayer, as there is no difference in handling streaming and non-streaming files.

**Example:**
```swift
let url:URL = URL(string:"https://zhgchg.li/aviciiwakemeup.m3u8")
var player: AVPlayer = AVPlayer(url: url)
player.play()
```
### **2021–01–05 Update:**

We have reverted to using mp3 files, which allows us to directly implement using `AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate`. For detailed implementation, refer to "[AVPlayer Streaming and Caching Practical Guide](../ee47f8f1e2d2/)."
### Implementation Solutions

Several solutions that can achieve our goal and the problems encountered during implementation.
#### Solution 1. AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate ❌

The first idea was to do it the same way as with mp3/mp4! Use AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate to cache the `.ts` files in the delegate methods.

However, unfortunately, this approach does not work because we cannot intercept the download request information for the `.ts` files in the delegate. You can find confirmation of this in this [Q&A](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29752028/unknown-error-12881-when-using-avassetresourceloader/30239876#30239876){:target="_blank"} and the [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2232/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40012884-CH1-SECHTTPLIVESTREAMING){:target="_blank"}.

For the implementation of AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate, refer to "[AVPlayer Streaming and Caching Practical Guide](../ee47f8f1e2d2/)."
#### Solution 2.1 URLProtocol Intercepting Requests ❌

URLProtocol is a method I recently learned, which allows us to intercept all requests based on the `URL Loading System` (URLSession, API calls, image downloads, etc.) to modify requests and responses seamlessly. For more on URLProtocol, refer to [this article](https://www.jianshu.com/p/fbe57730d3e1){:target="_blank"}.

Applying this method, we intended to intercept AVFoundation AVPlayer's requests for `.m3u8` and `.ts` files, returning cached data if available, or making a real request if not. This would also achieve our goal.

Again, unfortunately, this approach does not work either; AVFoundation AVPlayer's requests do not go through the `URL Loading System`, so we cannot intercept them.
_\*There is a claim that it works on the simulator but not on actual devices._
#### Solution 2.2 Force it into URLProtocol ❌

Based on Solution 2.1, a brute-force method would be to change the request URL to a custom scheme (e.g., streetVoiceCache://). Since AVFoundation cannot handle this request, it would be thrown out, allowing our URLProtocol to intercept it and perform our desired actions.
```swift
let url:URL = URL(string:"streetVoiceCache://zhgchg.li/aviciiwakemeup.m3u8?originSchme=https")
var player: AVPlayer = AVPlayer(url: url)
player.play()
```

URLProtocol would intercept `streetVoiceCache://zhgchg.li/aviciiwakemeup.m3u8?originSchme=https`, and we could restore it to the original URL, then send a URLSession request to fetch the data and implement caching. The requests for the `.ts` files in the m3u8 would also be intercepted by URLProtocol, allowing us to implement caching here as well.

Everything seemed perfect, but when I excitedly built and ran the app, Apple slapped me with:

`Error: 12881 “CoreMediaErrorDomain custom url not redirect”`

It does not accept the response data I provide for the `.ts` file requests; I can only use the `urlProtocol:wasRedirectedTo` method to redirect to the original HTTPS request for it to play normally. Even if I download the `.ts` files locally and redirect to that file:// path, it still doesn't accept it. According to [the official forum](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/30833){:target="_blank"}, the answer is that this cannot be done; `.m3u8` must originate from HTTP/HTTPS (so even if you place the entire `.m3u8` and all split `.ts` files locally, you cannot use file:// for AVPlayer playback), and `.ts` files cannot be provided with data via URLProtocol.

`fxxk…`
#### Solution 2.2–2 Same as Solution 2.2 but with AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate ❌

The implementation is similar to Solution 2.2, feeding AVPlayer a custom scheme to enter AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate; then we handle it ourselves.

The result is the same as 2.2:

`Error: 12881 “CoreMediaErrorDomain custom url not redirect”`

The same answer is found in [the official forum](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/113063){:target="_blank"}.

This can be used for decryption processing (see [this article](https://medium.com/@marslin_dev/how-to-play-aes-encrypted-video-with-airplay-2-82a353044f40){:target="_blank"} or [this example](https://www.jianshu.com/p/2c2cbe173e99){:target="_blank"}), but still cannot achieve caching functionality.
#### Solution 3. Reverse Proxy Server ⍻ (Feasible, but not perfect)

This method is the most commonly suggested solution when looking for how to handle HLS caching; it involves running an HTTP server on the app to serve as a reverse proxy.

The principle is simple: run an HTTP server on the app, say on port 8080, with the URL being `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`; then we can handle incoming requests and provide responses.

In our case, we would change the request URL to:
 `http://127.0.0.1:8080/aviciiwakemeup.m3u8?origin=http://zhgchg.li/`

In the HTTP server's handler, we intercept requests for `*.m3u8`, and when a request comes in, it goes to our handler, allowing us to control what data to respond with. The `.ts` files will also come in; here we can implement our desired caching mechanism.

To AVPlayer, this is just a standard streaming audio file at `http://*.m3u8`, so there won't be any issues.

**For a complete implementation example, refer to:**


[![](https://opengraph.githubassets.com/f82feda77c302ecf87673688fe78a46bccc4669783dda9b10093ecb5382f9895/StyleShare/HLSCachingReverseProxyServer)](https://github.com/StyleShare/HLSCachingReverseProxyServer/blob/master/Sources/HLSCachingReverseProxyServer/HLSCachingReverseProxyServer.swift){:target="_blank"}


Since I also referenced this example, I used [GCDWebServer](https://github.com/swisspol/GCDWebServer){:target="_blank"} for the local HTTP server part, and there's also the newer [Telegraph](https://github.com/Building42/Telegraph){:target="_blank"} available. \( [CocoaHttpServer](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaHTTPServer){:target="_blank"} hasn't been updated in a long time, so I don't recommend using it.\)

**It looks good! But there's a problem:**

Our service is a music streaming service rather than a video playback platform, and many times users are switching music while the app is running in the background; will the local HTTP server still be running then?

GCDWebServer's documentation states that it will automatically disconnect when entering the background and reconnect when returning to the foreground, but you can set the parameter `GCDWebServerOption_AutomaticallySuspendInBackground:false` to prevent this mechanism.

However, in practical tests, if there are no requests sent for a while, the server still disconnects (and the status will be incorrect, still showing as isRunning), which feels like it gets cut off by the system; after digging into [the HTTP server approach](https://izeeshan.wordpress.com/2014/08/25/local-http-server-for-ios/){:target="_blank"}, I found that the underlying implementation is based on sockets, and after checking [the official documentation on socket services](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2277/_index.html){:target="_blank"}, this flaw cannot be resolved, as the system will suspend it when there are no new connections in the background.

_\*I found a convoluted method online... just send a long request or continuously send empty requests to ensure the server doesn't get suspended by the system in the background._

All of the above are for the app's background situation; when in the foreground, the server is stable and won't be suspended due to idleness, so there's no issue!

**That said, since it relies on other services, while it works fine in the development environment, it's also recommended to implement rollback handling (AVPlayer.AVPlayerItemFailedToPlayToEndTimeErrorKey notification); otherwise, if the service goes down, users will be stuck.**

`So it's not perfect...`
#### Solution 4. Use the HTTP Client's own caching mechanism ❌

Our `.m3u8/.ts` file response headers provide `Cache-Control`, `Age`, `eTag`, and other HTTP client cache information; our website's caching mechanism works perfectly in Chrome, and I also saw mentions of setting cache-control headers for caching in the official new [Protocol Extension for Low-Latency HLS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/protocol_extension_for_low-latency_hls_preliminary_specification){:target="_blank"} specification document.

However, in practice, AVFoundation AVPlayer does not exhibit any HTTP client caching effects, so this approach does not work! It's just wishful thinking.
#### Solution 5. Do not use AVFoundation AVPlayer to play audio files ✔

Implement audio file parsing, caching, encoding, and playback functionality yourself.

**This is too hardcore, requiring deep technical skills and a lot of time; I haven't researched it.**

Here’s an open-source player for reference: [FreeStreamer](https://github.com/muhku/FreeStreamer){:target="_blank"}, and if you really want to choose this solution, it would be better to stand on the shoulders of giants and use a third-party library directly.
#### Solution 5–1. Do not use HLS

Same as Solution 5, **this is too hardcore, requiring deep technical skills and a lot of time; I haven't researched it.**
#### Solution 6. Convert .ts segment files to .mp3/.mp4 files ✔

I haven't researched this, but it is indeed feasible; however, it seems complicated to handle the downloaded `.ts` files, converting each to .mp3 or .mp4 files and playing them in order, or compressing them into a single file. It sounds quite challenging.

For those interested, refer to [this article](https://github.com/xyqjay/m3u8ToMP4){:target="_blank"}.
#### Solution 7. Download the complete file before playback ⍻

This method cannot be accurately called streaming and caching; it actually downloads the entire audio file content before starting playback. If it's `.m3u8`, as mentioned in Solution 2.2, it cannot be directly downloaded for local playback.

To implement this, you would need to use the iOS ≥ 10 API `AVAssetDownloadTask.makeAssetDownloadTask`, which will package the `.m3u8` into a **`.movpkg`** for local playback.

**This is more like implementing offline playback rather than caching functionality.**

Additionally, users can view and manage downloaded audio files from "Settings" -> "General" -> "iPhone Storage" -> APP.

### Conclusion

The exploration process took almost an entire week, going around in circles and nearly driving me crazy; currently, there is no reliable and easy-to-deploy method.

I will update if I have new ideas!
