I have open-sourced my previous implementation, which can be used directly by those in need.
- Customizable caching strategies, can use PINCache or others...
- Externally, just call the make AVAsset factory with the URL, and the AVAsset will support caching.
- Implemented Data Flow strategy using Combine.
- Wrote some tests.

### About

HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) is a streaming media network transport protocol based on HTTP proposed by Apple.

For music playback, in non-streaming scenarios, we use mp3 files, and the time taken to download the entire file depends on its size; however, HLS splits a file into multiple smaller files, allowing playback to start as soon as the first segment is received without needing to download the entire file!

The `.m3u8` file records the bitrate, playback order, duration, and overall audio information of these segmented `.ts` files. It can also implement encryption protection, low-latency live streaming, etc.

Example of an `.m3u8` file (aviciiwakemeup.m3u8):
```plaintext
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-VERSION:3
#EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:YES
#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:10
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:0
#EXTINF:9.900411,
aviciiwakemeup–00001.ts
#EXTINF:9.900400,
aviciiwakemeup–00002.ts
#EXTINF:9.900411,
aviciiwakemeup–00003.ts
#EXTINF:9.900411,
.
.
.
#EXTINF:6.269389,
aviciiwakemeup-00028.ts
#EXT-X-ENDLIST
```

_\*EXT\-X\-ALLOW\-CACHE has been deprecated in [iOS≥ 8/Protocol Ver\.7](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/about_the_ext-x-version_tag?language=objc){:target="_blank"} and is no longer meaningful whether this line is present or not._
### Goals

For a streaming media service, **caching is extremely important**; since each audio file can range from MBs to several GBs, if every replay requires fetching the file from the server again, it puts a significant load on the server, and data costs are high. Having a caching layer can save a lot of money for the service and prevent users from wasting bandwidth and time re-downloading; it's a win-win mechanism (but remember to set limits/timely clear caches to avoid overwhelming users' devices).
### Issues

In the past, non-streaming mp3/mp4 files were straightforward to handle; you would download them to the device before playback, starting playback only after the download was complete. Since you had to finish downloading before playback, you could simply use URLSession to download the file and then provide the local file path to AVPlayer for playback; or, in a standard way, use AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate to cache the downloaded data in the delegate methods.

When it comes to streaming, the idea is quite simple: read the `.m3u8` file, parse the information inside, and cache each `.ts` file. However, the implementation turned out to be more complicated than I expected, which is why this article exists!

For playback, we still use AVPlayer from iOS AVFoundation directly, as there is no difference in handling streaming and non-streaming files.

**Example:**
```swift
let url:URL = URL(string:"https://zhgchg.li/aviciiwakemeup.m3u8")
var player: AVPlayer = AVPlayer(url: url)
player.play()
```
### **2021–01–05 Update:**

We have reverted to using mp3 files, allowing us to directly implement using `AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate`. For detailed implementation, refer to "[AVPlayer Caching in Action](../ee47f8f1e2d2/)."
### Implementation Solutions

Several solutions to achieve our goals and the issues encountered during implementation.
#### Solution 1. AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate ❌

The first idea was to follow the same approach as with mp3/mp4 files! Use AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate to cache the `.ts` files in the delegate methods.

However, this route is not viable, as we cannot intercept the download request information for `.ts` files in the delegate. You can find confirmation of this in [this Q&A](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29752028/unknown-error-12881-when-using-avassetresourceloader/30239876#30239876){:target="_blank"} and [the official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2232/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40012884-CH1-SECHTTPLIVESTREAMING){:target="_blank"}.

For implementation details of AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate, refer to "[AVPlayer Caching in Action](../ee47f8f1e2d2/)."
#### Solution 2.1 Intercept Requests with URLProtocol ❌

URLProtocol is a method I recently learned, allowing us to intercept all requests based on the `URL Loading System` (URLSession, API calls, image downloads, etc.) to modify requests and responses seamlessly. For more on URLProtocol, refer to [this article](https://www.jianshu.com/p/fbe57730d3e1){:target="_blank"}.

Applying this method, we intended to intercept AVFoundation AVPlayer's requests for `.m3u8` and `.ts` files, returning cached data if available, or making a real request if not; this would also achieve our goal.

Unfortunately, this route is also not viable; AVFoundation AVPlayer's requests do not operate within the `URL Loading System`, so we cannot intercept them.
_\*There is a claim that it works on the simulator but not on actual devices._
#### Solution 2.2 Force URLProtocol to Intercept ❌

Based on Solution 2.1, a brute-force method would be to change the request URL to a custom scheme (e.g., streetVoiceCache://). Since AVFoundation cannot handle this request, it would be thrown out, allowing our URLProtocol to intercept it and perform our desired actions.
```swift
let url:URL = URL(string:"streetVoiceCache://zhgchg.li/aviciiwakemeup.m3u8?originSchme=https")
var player: AVPlayer = AVPlayer(url: url)
player.play()
```

URLProtocol would intercept `streetVoiceCache://zhgchg.li/aviciiwakemeup.m3u8?originSchme=https`, and we could revert it to the original URL, then send a URLSession request to fetch the data and implement caching; requests for `.ts` files would also be intercepted by URLProtocol, allowing us to implement caching there as well.

Everything seemed perfect, but when I eagerly built and ran the app, Apple slapped me with:

`Error: 12881 “CoreMediaErrorDomain custom url not redirect”`

It does not accept the response data I provide for the `.ts` file request; I can only use `urlProtocol:wasRedirectedTo` to redirect to the original HTTPS request for it to play normally. Even if I download the `.ts` file locally and try to redirect to that file:// path, it is also rejected. According to [the official forum](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/30833){:target="_blank"}, this cannot be done; `.m3u8` must originate from HTTP/HTTPS (so even if you place the entire `.m3u8` and all segmented `.ts` files locally, you cannot use file:// for AVPlayer playback), and `.ts` files cannot be provided with data via URLProtocol.

`fxxk…`
#### Solution 2.2–2 Same as Solution 2.2 but with AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate ❌

The implementation is similar to Solution 2.2, feeding AVPlayer a custom scheme to enter AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate; then we handle it ourselves.

Same result as 2.2:

`Error: 12881 “CoreMediaErrorDomain custom url not redirect”`

The same response is found in [the official forum](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/113063){:target="_blank"}.

This can be used for decryption processing (see [this article](https://medium.com/@marslin_dev/how-to-play-aes-encrypted-video-with-airplay-2-82a353044f40){:target="_blank"} or [this example](https://www.jianshu.com/p/2c2cbe173e99){:target="_blank"}), but caching functionality cannot be achieved.
#### Solution 3. Reverse Proxy Server ⍻ (Feasible but Not Perfect)

This method is the most commonly suggested solution for handling HLS caching; it involves running an HTTP server in the app to serve as a reverse proxy.

The principle is simple: run an HTTP server on the app, say on port 8080, with the URL being `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`; we can then handle incoming requests and provide responses.

In our case, we would change the request URL to:
 `http://127.0.0.1:8080/aviciiwakemeup.m3u8?origin=http://zhgchg.li/`

In the HTTP server's handler, we intercept requests for `*.m3u8`, and any incoming requests will enter our handler, allowing us to control the response data, including for `.ts` files; here we can implement our desired caching mechanism.

To AVPlayer, it appears as a standard streaming audio file at `http://*.m3u8`, so there will be no issues.

**For a complete implementation example, refer to:**


[![](https://opengraph.githubassets.com/f82feda77c302ecf87673688fe78a46bccc4669783dda9b10093ecb5382f9895/StyleShare/HLSCachingReverseProxyServer)](https://github.com/StyleShare/HLSCachingReverseProxyServer/blob/master/Sources/HLSCachingReverseProxyServer/HLSCachingReverseProxyServer.swift){:target="_blank"}


Since I also referenced this example, I used [GCDWebServer](https://github.com/swisspol/GCDWebServer){:target="_blank"} for the local HTTP server part, and there's also the newer [Telegraph](https://github.com/Building42/Telegraph){:target="_blank"} available. \( [CocoaHttpServer](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaHTTPServer){:target="_blank"} is not recommended due to lack of updates\)

**It looks good! But there's a problem:**

Our service is a music streaming service rather than a video playback platform, and many times users switch music while running in the background; will the local HTTP server still be active then?

GCDWebServer's documentation states that it will automatically disconnect when entering the background and reconnect when returning to the foreground, but you can set the parameter `GCDWebServerOption_AutomaticallySuspendInBackground:false` to prevent this mechanism.

However, in practice, if there are no requests sent for a while, the server will still disconnect (and the status will be incorrect, still showing as isRunning); it seems to be cut off by the system; after digging into [the HTTP server implementation](https://izeeshan.wordpress.com/2014/08/25/local-http-server-for-ios/){:target="_blank"}, I found that the underlying implementation is based on sockets, and according to [the official documentation on socket services](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2277/_index.html){:target="_blank"}, this limitation cannot be resolved; the system will suspend it when there are no new connections in the background.

_\*I found a convoluted method online... which involves sending a long request or continuously sending empty requests to ensure the server does not get suspended by the system in the background._

All of the above pertains to the app's background state; in the foreground, the server is stable and does not get suspended due to inactivity, so there are no issues!

**That said, since it relies on other services, while testing in the development environment is fine, it is also recommended to implement rollback handling (AVPlayer.AVPlayerItemFailedToPlayToEndTimeErrorKey notification); otherwise, if the service goes down, users will be stuck.**

`So it's not perfect...`
#### Solution 4. Use the HTTP Client's Own Caching Mechanism ❌

Our `.m3u8/.ts` file response headers provide `Cache-Control`, `Age`, `eTag`, and other HTTP client cache information; our website's caching mechanism works perfectly in Chrome, and the official new preliminary specification document for [Protocol Extension for Low-Latency HLS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/protocol_extension_for_low-latency_hls_preliminary_specification){:target="_blank"} also mentions caching and the ability to set cache-control headers.

![](/assets/d796bf8e661e/1*vyvVp1sf9Hbtb_nWiLXYEg.png)


However, in practice, AVFoundation AVPlayer does not exhibit any HTTP client caching effects, so this route is also unviable! It's simply wishful thinking.
#### Solution 5. Do Not Use AVFoundation AVPlayer for Audio Playback ✔

Implement audio file parsing, caching, encoding, and playback functionality yourself.

**This is too hardcore, requiring deep technical skills and a significant amount of time; I haven't researched it.**

Here’s an open-source player for reference: [FreeStreamer](https://github.com/muhku/FreeStreamer){:target="_blank"}, and if you choose this solution, it would be better to stand on the shoulders of giants and use a third-party library directly.
#### Solution 5–1. Do Not Use HLS

Same as Solution 5, **this is too hardcore, requiring deep technical skills and a significant amount of time; I haven't researched it.**
#### Solution 6. Convert .ts Segmented Files to .mp3/.mp4 Files ✔

I haven't researched this, but it is indeed feasible; however, it seems complicated to handle the downloaded `.ts` files, converting each to .mp3 or .mp4 files and playing them in order, or compressing them into a single file, seems challenging.

For those interested, refer to [this article](https://github.com/xyqjay/m3u8ToMP4){:target="_blank"}.
#### Solution 7. Download the Complete File Before Playback ⍻

This method cannot be accurately described as caching while streaming; it involves downloading the entire audio file content before starting playback. If it’s `.m3u8`, as mentioned in Solution 2.2, it cannot be directly downloaded for local playback.

To implement this, you would need to use the iOS ≥ 10 API `AVAssetDownloadTask.makeAssetDownloadTask`, which would package the `.m3u8` into a **`.movpkg`** for local playback.

**This is more akin to offline playback rather than caching functionality.**

Additionally, users can view and manage downloaded audio files from "Settings" -> "General" -> "iPhone Storage" -> APP.

### Conclusion

The exploration process above took almost a whole week, going around in circles and nearly driving me crazy; currently, there is no reliable and easy-to-deploy method.

I will update if I have new ideas!
