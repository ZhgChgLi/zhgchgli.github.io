I have open-sourced my previous implementation, so friends in need can use it directly.
- Customizable cache strategies, can use PINCache or others...
- Externally, just call the make AVAsset factory with the URL, and the AVAsset will support caching.
- Implemented Data Flow strategy using Combine.
- Wrote some tests.

### About

HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) is a streaming media network transport protocol based on HTTP proposed by Apple.

For music playback, in non-streaming situations, we use mp3 as the music file; the larger the file, the longer it takes to download it completely before playback can start. HLS splits a file into multiple smaller files, allowing playback to begin as soon as the first segment is received, without needing to download the entire file!

The `.m3u8` file records the bitrate, playback order, duration, and overall audio information of these segmented `.ts` files. It can also implement encryption protection, low-latency live streaming, etc.

Example of a `.m3u8` file (aviciiwakemeup.m3u8):
```plaintext
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-VERSION:3
#EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:YES
#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:10
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:0
#EXTINF:9.900411,
aviciiwakemeup–00001.ts
#EXTINF:9.900400,
aviciiwakemeup–00002.ts
#EXTINF:9.900411,
aviciiwakemeup–00003.ts
#EXTINF:9.900411,
.
.
.
#EXTINF:6.269389,
aviciiwakemeup-00028.ts
#EXT-X-ENDLIST
```

_\*EXT\-X\-ALLOW\-CACHE has been deprecated in [iOS≥ 8/Protocol Ver\.7](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/about_the_ext-x-version_tag?language=objc){:target="_blank"} and is no longer meaningful whether this line is present or not._
### Goal

For a streaming media service, **caching is extremely important**; since each audio file can range from MBs to several GBs, if every replay requires fetching the file again from the server, it puts a significant load on the server, and data costs are high. A caching layer can save a lot of money for the service and prevent users from wasting bandwidth and time re-downloading; it's a win-win mechanism (but remember to set limits/timely clear caches to avoid filling up users' devices).
### Issues

In the past, non-streaming mp3/mp4 files were straightforward to handle; you would download them to the device before playback could start. Regardless, you had to finish downloading before playback, so why not just use URLSession to download the file and then feed the local file path to AVPlayer for playback? Alternatively, you could use the proper method, utilizing AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate to cache the downloaded data.

When it comes to streaming, the idea is quite simple: read the `.m3u8` file, parse the information inside, and cache each `.ts` file. However, the implementation turned out to be more complicated than I expected, which is why this article exists!

For playback, we still use iOS AVFoundation's AVPlayer, as there is no difference in operation between streaming and non-streaming files.

**Example:**
```swift
let url:URL = URL(string:"https://zhgchg.li/aviciiwakemeup.m3u8")
var player: AVPlayer = AVPlayer(url: url)
player.play()
```
### **2021–01–05 Update:**

We have reverted to using mp3 files, allowing us to directly implement using `AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate`. For detailed implementation, refer to "[AVPlayer Caching While Playing](../ee47f8f1e2d2/)."
### Implementation Solutions

Several solutions to achieve our goal and the issues encountered during implementation.
#### Solution 1. AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate ❌

The first idea was to follow the same approach as with mp3/mp4 files! Use AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate to cache the `.ts` files in the delegate methods.

Unfortunately, this route is not viable, as we cannot intercept the download request information for `.ts` files in the delegate. This is confirmed in this [Q&A](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29752028/unknown-error-12881-when-using-avassetresourceloader/30239876#30239876){:target="_blank"} and the [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2232/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40012884-CH1-SECHTTPLIVESTREAMING){:target="_blank"}.

For AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate implementation, refer to "[AVPlayer Caching While Playing](../ee47f8f1e2d2/)."
#### Solution 2.1 URLProtocol Intercept Requests ❌

URLProtocol is a method I recently learned, allowing us to intercept all requests based on the `URL Loading System` (URLSession, API calls, image downloads, etc.) to modify requests and responses and return them as if nothing happened. For more on URLProtocol, refer to [this article](https://www.jianshu.com/p/fbe57730d3e1){:target="_blank"}.

Applying this method, we planned to intercept AVFoundation AVPlayer's requests for `.m3u8` and `.ts` files, returning cached data if available, or making a real request if not. This would also achieve our goal.

Again, unfortunately, this route is not viable; AVFoundation AVPlayer's requests do not go through the `URL Loading System`, so we cannot intercept them.
_\*There is a claim that it works on the simulator but not on actual devices._
#### Solution 2.2 Force it into URLProtocol ❌

Based on Solution 2.1, a brute-force method would be to change the request URL to a custom scheme (e.g., streetVoiceCache://). Since AVFoundation cannot handle this request, it would throw an error, allowing our URLProtocol to intercept it and perform our desired actions.
```swift
let url:URL = URL(string:"streetVoiceCache://zhgchg.li/aviciiwakemeup.m3u8?originSchme=https")
var player: AVPlayer = AVPlayer(url: url)
player.play()
```

URLProtocol would intercept `streetVoiceCache://zhgchg.li/aviciiwakemeup.m3u8?originSchme=https`, and we would simply restore it to the original URL, then send a URLSession request to fetch the data, allowing us to implement caching; requests for `.ts` files would also be intercepted by URLProtocol, enabling us to cache them as well.

Everything seemed perfect, but after I excitedly built and ran the app, Apple slapped me with:

`Error: 12881 “CoreMediaErrorDomain custom url not redirect”`

It does not accept the response data I provide for the `.ts` file request; I can only use the `urlProtocol:wasRedirectedTo` method to redirect to the original HTTPS request for it to play correctly. Even if I download the `.ts` file locally and redirect to that file:// file, it still does not accept it. According to [the official forum](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/30833){:target="_blank"}, this is not allowed; `.m3u8` must originate from HTTP/HTTPS (so even if you place the entire `.m3u8` and all segmented `.ts` files locally, you cannot use file:// for AVPlayer playback), and `.ts` files cannot be provided with data via URLProtocol.

`fxxk…`
#### Solution 2.2–2 Same as Solution 2.2 but with AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate ❌

The implementation method is similar to Solution 2.2, feeding AVPlayer a custom scheme to enter AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate; then we handle it ourselves.

Same result as 2.2:

`Error: 12881 “CoreMediaErrorDomain custom url not redirect”`

The same answer is found on the [official forum](https://developer.apple.com/thread/113063){:target="_blank"}.

It can be used for decryption processing (see [this article](https://medium.com/@marslin_dev/how-to-play-aes-encrypted-video-with-airplay-2-82a353044f40){:target="_blank"} or [this example](https://www.jianshu.com/p/2c2cbe173e99){:target="_blank"}), but still cannot achieve caching functionality.
#### Solution 3. Reverse Proxy Server ⍻ (Feasible, but not perfect)

This method is the most commonly suggested solution when looking for how to handle HLS caching; it involves running an HTTP server on the app to serve as a reverse proxy server.

The principle is simple: run an HTTP server on the app, say on port 8080, making the URL `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`; then we can handle incoming requests and provide responses.

Applied to our case, we change the request URL to:
 `http://127.0.0.1:8080/aviciiwakemeup.m3u8?origin=http://zhgchg.li/`

In the HTTP server's handler, we intercept `*.m3u8` requests; when a request comes in, it enters our handler, and we can do whatever we want, controlling what data to respond with. The `.ts` files will also come in; here we can implement our desired caching mechanism.

To AVPlayer, this is just a standard streaming audio file at `http://*.m3u8`, so there will be no issues.

**For a complete implementation example, refer to:**


[![](https://opengraph.githubassets.com/f82feda77c302ecf87673688fe78a46bccc4669783dda9b10093ecb5382f9895/StyleShare/HLSCachingReverseProxyServer)](https://github.com/StyleShare/HLSCachingReverseProxyServer/blob/master/Sources/HLSCachingReverseProxyServer/HLSCachingReverseProxyServer.swift){:target="_blank"}


Since I also referenced this example, I used [GCDWebServer](https://github.com/swisspol/GCDWebServer){:target="_blank"} for the local HTTP server part. Additionally, the newer [Telegraph](https://github.com/Building42/Telegraph){:target="_blank"} can be used. \( [CocoaHttpServer](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaHTTPServer){:target="_blank"} is not recommended due to lack of updates\)

**It looks good! But there’s a problem:**

Our service is a music streaming service rather than a video playback platform, and many times users are switching music while the app is running in the background; will the local HTTP server still be active then?

GCDWebServer's documentation states that it will automatically disconnect when entering the background and reconnect when returning to the foreground, but you can set the parameter `GCDWebServerOption_AutomaticallySuspendInBackground:false` to prevent this mechanism.

However, in practical tests, if there are no requests sent for a period, the server still disconnects (and the status will be incorrect, still showing as isRunning); it seems to be cut off by the system. After delving into the [HTTP Server implementation](https://izeeshan.wordpress.com/2014/08/25/local-http-server-for-ios/){:target="_blank"}, I found that the underlying implementation is based on sockets, and according to [the official documentation on socket services](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2277/_index.html){:target="_blank"}, this limitation cannot be resolved; the system will suspend it when there are no new connections in the background.

_\*I found a convoluted method online... just send a long request or continuously send empty requests to ensure the server does not get suspended by the system in the background._

All of the above pertains to the app's background situation; when in the foreground, the server is stable and does not get suspended due to inactivity, so there is no issue!

**That said, since it relies on other services, it works fine in the development environment, but in actual applications, it is advisable to implement rollback handling (AVPlayer.AVPlayerItemFailedToPlayToEndTimeErrorKey notification); otherwise, if the service goes down, users will be stuck.**

`So it’s not perfect…`
#### Solution 4. Use the HTTP Client's own caching mechanism ❌

Our `.m3u8/.ts` file response headers provide `Cache-Control`, `Age`, `eTag`, and other HTTP client cache information; our website's caching mechanism works perfectly in Chrome, and I also saw mentions of cache-control headers for caching in the official new [Protocol Extension for Low-Latency HLS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/protocol_extension_for_low-latency_hls_preliminary_specification){:target="_blank"} specification document.


![](/assets/d796bf8e661e/1*vyvVp1sf9Hbtb_nWiLXYEg.png)


However, in practice, AVFoundation AVPlayer does not exhibit any HTTP client caching effects, so this route is also not viable! It’s just wishful thinking.
#### Solution 5. Do not use AVFoundation AVPlayer to play audio files ✔

Implement audio file parsing, caching, encoding, and playback functionality yourself.

**This is too hardcore, requiring deep technical skills and a lot of time; I haven’t researched it.**

Here’s an open-source player for reference: [FreeStreamer](https://github.com/muhku/FreeStreamer){:target="_blank"}, and if you choose this solution, it’s better to stand on the shoulders of giants and use third-party libraries directly.
#### Solution 5–1. Do not use HLS

Same as Solution 5, **this is too hardcore, requiring deep technical skills and a lot of time; I haven’t researched it.**
#### Solution 6. Convert .ts segmented files to .mp3/.mp4 files ✔

I haven’t researched this, but it is indeed feasible; however, it seems complicated to handle the downloaded `.ts` files, converting each to .mp3 or .mp4 files and playing them in order, or compressing them into a single file, which sounds quite challenging.

For those interested, refer to [this article](https://github.com/xyqjay/m3u8ToMP4){:target="_blank"}.
#### Solution 7. Download the complete file before playback ⍻

This method cannot be accurately called caching while playing; it actually downloads the entire audio file content before playback can start. If it’s `.m3u8`, as mentioned in Solution 2.2, it cannot be directly downloaded for local playback.

To implement this, you would need to use the iOS ≥ 10 API `AVAssetDownloadTask.makeAssetDownloadTask`, which will package the `.m3u8` into a **`.movpkg`** for local playback.

**This is more akin to offline playback rather than implementing caching functionality.**

Additionally, users can view and manage downloaded audio files from "Settings" -> "General" -> "iPhone Storage" -> APP.

### Conclusion

The exploration process above took almost an entire week, going around in circles and nearly driving me crazy; currently, there is no reliable and easy-to-deploy method.

I will update if I have new ideas!
