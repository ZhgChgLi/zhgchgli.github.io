I have open-sourced my previous implementation, so friends in need can use it directly.
- Customizable caching strategies, can use PINCache or others...
- Externally, just call the make AVAsset factory with the URL, and the AVAsset will support caching.
- Implemented data flow strategies using Combine.
- Wrote some tests.

### About

HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) is a streaming media network transmission protocol based on HTTP proposed by Apple.

For music playback, in non-streaming situations, we use mp3 as the music file; the time taken to download the entire file depends on its size. HLS, on the other hand, splits a file into multiple smaller files, allowing playback to start as soon as the first segment is received, without needing to download the entire file first!

The `.m3u8` file records the bitrate, playback order, duration, and overall audio information of these segmented `.ts` files. It can also implement encryption protection, low-latency live streaming, etc.

Example of a `.m3u8` file (aviciiwakemeup.m3u8):
```plaintext
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-VERSION:3
#EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:YES
#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:10
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:0
#EXTINF:9.900411,
aviciiwakemeup–00001.ts
#EXTINF:9.900400,
aviciiwakemeup–00002.ts
#EXTINF:9.900411,
aviciiwakemeup–00003.ts
#EXTINF:9.900411,
.
.
.
#EXTINF:6.269389,
aviciiwakemeup-00028.ts
#EXT-X-ENDLIST
```

_\*EXT\-X\-ALLOW\-CACHE has been deprecated in [iOS≥ 8/Protocol Ver\.7](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/about_the_ext-x-version_tag?language=objc){:target="_blank"} and is no longer meaningful whether this line is present or not._
### Goals

For a streaming media service, **caching is extremely important**; since each audio file can range from MBs to several GBs, if every replay requires fetching the file from the server again, it puts a heavy load on the server, and data costs are significant. Having a caching layer can save a lot of money for the service and prevent users from wasting bandwidth and time re-downloading; it's a win-win mechanism (but remember to set limits/timely clean-up to avoid overwhelming users' devices).
### Issues

In the past, with non-streaming mp3/mp4 files, there wasn't much to handle; you would download the file to the device before playback, starting playback only after the download was complete. Since you had to download the entire file to play it, you could just use URLSession to download the file and then feed the local file path to AVPlayer for playback; or, in a standard way, use AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate to cache the downloaded data in the delegate methods.

When it comes to streaming, the idea is straightforward: read the `.m3u8` file, parse the information inside, and cache each `.ts` file. However, I found that the implementation was not as simple as expected, and the complexity exceeded my imagination, which is why this article exists!

For playback, we still use AVPlayer from iOS AVFoundation directly, as there is no difference in handling streaming and non-streaming files.

**Example:**
```swift
let url:URL = URL(string:"https://zhgchg.li/aviciiwakemeup.m3u8")
var player: AVPlayer = AVPlayer(url: url)
player.play()
```
### **2021–01–05 Update:**

We have reverted to using mp3 files, which allows us to directly implement using `AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate`. For detailed implementation, refer to "[AVPlayer Caching While Playing](../ee47f8f1e2d2/)."
### Implementation Solutions

Several solutions to achieve our goals and the issues encountered during implementation.
#### Solution 1. AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate ❌

The first idea was to follow the same approach as with mp3/mp4 files! Use AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate to cache the `.ts` files in the delegate methods.

However, unfortunately, this route is not viable because we cannot intercept the download request information for `.ts` files in the delegate. This is confirmed in this [Q&A](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29752028/unknown-error-12881-when-using-avassetresourceloader/30239876#30239876){:target="_blank"} and [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2232/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40012884-CH1-SECHTTPLIVESTREAMING){:target="_blank"}.

For implementation of AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate, refer to "[AVPlayer Caching While Playing](../ee47f8f1e2d2/)."
#### Solution 2.1 Intercept Requests with URLProtocol ❌

URLProtocol is a method I recently learned, allowing us to intercept all requests based on the `URL Loading System` (URLSession, API calls, image downloads, etc.) to modify requests and responses seamlessly. For more about URLProtocol, refer to [this article](https://www.jianshu.com/p/fbe57730d3e1){:target="_blank"}.

Using this method, we planned to intercept AVFoundation AVPlayer's requests for `.m3u8` and `.ts` files, returning cached data if available, or making a real request if not; this would also achieve our goal.

Again, unfortunately, this route is not viable either; AVFoundation AVPlayer's requests do not operate within the `URL Loading System`, so we cannot intercept them.
_\*There is a claim that it works on the simulator but not on actual devices._
#### Solution 2.2 Force it into URLProtocol ❌

Based on Solution 2.1, a brute-force method is to change the request URL to a custom scheme (e.g., streetVoiceCache://). Since AVFoundation cannot handle this request, it will throw it out, allowing our URLProtocol to intercept it and perform our desired actions.
```swift
let url:URL = URL(string:"streetVoiceCache://zhgchg.li/aviciiwakemeup.m3u8?originSchme=https")
var player: AVPlayer = AVPlayer(url: url)
player.play()
```

URLProtocol will intercept `streetVoiceCache://zhgchg.li/aviciiwakemeup.m3u8?originSchme=https`, and we can restore it to the original URL, then send a URLSession request to fetch the data, allowing us to implement caching; requests for `.ts` files in the m3u8 will also be intercepted by URLProtocol, enabling us to cache them as well.

Everything seemed perfect, but when I excitedly built and ran the app, Apple slapped me with:

`Error: 12881 “CoreMediaErrorDomain custom url not redirect”`

It does not accept the response data I provide for the `.ts` file request; I can only use the `urlProtocol:wasRedirectedTo` method to redirect to the original HTTPS request for it to play normally. Even if I download the `.ts` file locally and try to redirect to that file:// file, it is also rejected. According to [the official forum](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/30833){:target="_blank"}, the answer is that this cannot be done; `.m3u8` must originate from HTTP/HTTPS (so even if you place the entire `.m3u8` and all the segmented `.ts` files locally, you cannot use file:// for AVPlayer playback), and `.ts` files cannot be provided with data via URLProtocol.

`fxxk…`
#### Solution 2.2–2 Same as Solution 2.2 but with AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate ❌

The implementation is similar to Solution 2.2, feeding AVPlayer a custom scheme to enter AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate; then we handle it ourselves.

Same result as 2.2:

`Error: 12881 “CoreMediaErrorDomain custom url not redirect”`

The same answer is found in [the official forum](https://developer.apple.com/thread/113063){:target="_blank"}.

This can be used for decryption processing (see [this article](https://medium.com/@marslin_dev/how-to-play-aes-encrypted-video-with-airplay-2-82a353044f40){:target="_blank"} or [this example](https://www.jianshu.com/p/2c2cbe173e99){:target="_blank"}), but still cannot achieve caching functionality.
#### Solution 3. Reverse Proxy Server ⍻ (Feasible but not perfect)

This method is the most commonly suggested solution when looking for how to handle HLS caching; it involves running an HTTP server on the app to serve as a reverse proxy.

The principle is simple: run an HTTP server on the app, say on port 8080, making the URL `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`; then we can handle incoming requests and provide responses.

Applied to our case, we change the request URL to:
 `http://127.0.0.1:8080/aviciiwakemeup.m3u8?origin=http://zhgchg.li/`

In the HTTP server's handler, we intercept `*.m3u8` requests, and when a request comes in, it enters our handler, allowing us to control what data to respond with; the `.ts` files will also come in, and we can implement our desired caching mechanism here.

To AVPlayer, it appears as a standard streaming audio file at `http://*.m3u8`, so there will be no issues.

**Complete implementation example can be found at:**


[![](https://opengraph.githubassets.com/f82feda77c302ecf87673688fe78a46bccc4669783dda9b10093ecb5382f9895/StyleShare/HLSCachingReverseProxyServer)](https://github.com/StyleShare/HLSCachingReverseProxyServer/blob/master/Sources/HLSCachingReverseProxyServer/HLSCachingReverseProxyServer.swift){:target="_blank"}


Since I also referenced this example, I used [GCDWebServer](https://github.com/swisspol/GCDWebServer){:target="_blank"} for the local HTTP server part, and there is also the newer [Telegraph](https://github.com/Building42/Telegraph){:target="_blank"} available. \( [CocoaHttpServer](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaHTTPServer){:target="_blank"} is not recommended as it hasn't been updated in a long time.\)

**It looks good! But there is a problem:**

Our service is a music streaming service rather than a video playback platform, and many times users are switching music while the app is running in the background; will the local HTTP server still be active then?

GCDWebServer's documentation states that it will automatically disconnect when entering the background and reconnect when returning to the foreground, but you can set the parameter `GCDWebServerOption_AutomaticallySuspendInBackground:false` to prevent this mechanism.

However, in practice, if there is no request sent for a while, the server will still disconnect (and the status will be incorrect, still showing as isRunning); it seems to be cut off by the system; after digging into [the HTTP server implementation](https://izeeshan.wordpress.com/2014/08/25/local-http-server-for-ios/){:target="_blank"}, I found that the underlying implementation is based on sockets, and after checking [the official documentation on socket services](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2277/_index.html){:target="_blank"}, this flaw cannot be resolved; the system will suspend it when there are no new connections in the background.

_\*I found a convoluted method online... just send a long request or continuously send empty requests to ensure the server does not get suspended by the system in the background._

All of the above pertains to the app's background state; in the foreground, the server is stable and does not get suspended due to idleness, so there is no issue!

**That said, since it relies on other services, while testing in the development environment is fine, it is also recommended to implement a rollback handling (AVPlayer.AVPlayerItemFailedToPlayToEndTimeErrorKey notification); otherwise, if the service goes down, users will be stuck.**

`So it's not perfect...`
#### Solution 4. Use the HTTP Client's own caching mechanism ❌

Our `.m3u8/.ts` files' response headers provide `Cache-Control`, `Age`, `eTag`, and other HTTP client cache information; our website's caching mechanism works perfectly in Chrome, and I also saw mentions of setting cache-control headers for caching in the official new preliminary specification document for [Protocol Extension for Low-Latency HLS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/protocol_extension_for_low-latency_hls_preliminary_specification){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/d796bf8e661e/1*vyvVp1sf9Hbtb_nWiLXYEg.png)


However, in practice, AVFoundation AVPlayer does not exhibit any HTTP client caching effects, so this route is also not viable! It's just wishful thinking.
#### Solution 5. Do not use AVFoundation AVPlayer to play audio files ✔

Implement your own audio file parsing, caching, encoding, and playback functionality.

**This is too hardcore, requiring deep technical skills and a lot of time; I haven't researched it.**

Here’s an open-source player for reference: [FreeStreamer](https://github.com/muhku/FreeStreamer){:target="_blank"}, and if you really want to choose this solution, it would be better to stand on the shoulders of giants and use a third-party library directly.
#### Solution 5–1. Do not use HLS

Same as Solution 5, **this is too hardcore, requiring deep technical skills and a lot of time; I haven't researched it.**
#### Solution 6. Convert .ts segmented files to .mp3/.mp4 files ✔

I haven't researched this, but it is indeed feasible; however, it seems complex to handle the downloaded `.ts` files, converting each to .mp3 or .mp4 files and playing them in order, or compressing them into a single file, seems quite challenging.

For those interested, refer to [this article](https://github.com/xyqjay/m3u8ToMP4){:target="_blank"}.
#### Solution 7. Download the complete file before playback ⍻

This method cannot be accurately called caching while playing; it actually downloads the entire audio file content before starting playback. If it's `.m3u8`, as mentioned in Solution 2.2, it cannot be directly downloaded for local playback.

To implement this, you would need to use the iOS ≥ 10 API `AVAssetDownloadTask.makeAssetDownloadTask`, which will package the `.m3u8` into a **`.movpkg`** stored locally for user playback.

**This is more akin to offline playback rather than caching functionality.**

Additionally, users can view and manage the downloaded audio files from "Settings" -> "General" -> "iPhone Storage" -> APP.

### Conclusion

The exploration process took almost a whole week, going around in circles and nearly driving me crazy; currently, there is no reliable and easy-to-deploy method.

I will update if I have new ideas!
