### Always Maintain the Passion for Exploring New Things

The life opportunity of transitioning from the information field to iOS APP development

Bangkok 2018 \- [Z Realm — You Are Not Alone on the Path to Solving Problems](https://medium.com/u/8854784154b8){:target="_blank"}

Time flies. It has been a year since I transitioned from Back End to Mobile iOS APP development, and it has been a month since I started writing on Medium. Allow me to write a little milestone for my 10th article about my experiences of self-breakthrough and career transition.
#### Always Maintain the Passion for Exploring New Things

"The instinct to explore drives humanity's great achievements." From Columbus exploring the oceans and discovering new continents, to the Wright brothers improving airplanes and conquering the skies, to now leaving Earth to explore outer space; only with a passion for new things can we continuously surpass ourselves. Perhaps we cannot be as great as Armstrong, but as he said, "One small step for you may be a giant leap for mankind." Do not underestimate your own creativity and abilities.
#### Opportunity

When opportunities arise, seize them well, as there is no guarantee there will be a second chance. You may hesitate, thinking perhaps a better one will come or fearing you might make the wrong decision, but "Who knows **s**? [Is it the sun that rises first or the unexpected that arrives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzuy63eCUKc){:target="_blank"}?" If there are no negative consequences, then open your arms and embrace the opportunity!

Let's rewind to 2009. When I just entered Chang Gung Vocational High School as a freshman, I learned by chance that the school was training participants for competitions. My initial thought was, "Since I have nothing to do at home, I might as well learn something," so I signed up. This was the first turning point in my life, leading me into the information field. Joining the training was tough; I practiced at school every day after class, on weekends, and during winter and summer breaks for three years. The risks were high; if I didn't place in the competition, I would have gained almost nothing. However, looking back, I am glad I seized this opportunity (I will elaborate on the journey of the participants later).

This opportunity taught me many essential skills, including design tools like Illustrator/Photoshop/Flash, and engineering skills like PHP/MySQL/HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery. I was also granted admission to National Taiwan University of Science and Technology due to my championship qualification. Looking back, I am truly grateful that I seized this opportunity!

Fast forward to 2017, after graduating from university, I entered the workforce as a back-end engineer. During university, I mainly specialized in back-end development (Laravel) and did not focus much on front-end development, relying on existing frameworks (Bootstrap/Semantic UI).

At this point, I faced a bottleneck from being in the same field for too long without any breakthrough. Therefore, I set new goals for myself:
1. Continue to explore back-end development
2. Transition to marketing (GA)/planning
3. Learn new languages/write apps

At this time, another opportunity arose. The project I joined was about to start developing a mobile platform application. Initially, I set out to write the API back-end, using Laravel and some new technologies, which was a breakthrough for me. It is important to mention that when making decisions, one should look far ahead. The reason I initially chose to continue with back-end development was due to laziness and the perception that the entry cost was high, as I did not have a Mac and was entering a completely new field. Fortunately, with my supervisor's guidance, I ultimately chose to step into iOS APP development.

Now in 2018, it has been a year since I started developing iOS APPs. What I have gained includes learning a new language, Swift, iOS APP development, the sense of achievement from launching my own APP, and starting to write on Medium. I am glad I seized this opportunity, as it has opened another window for my career!
#### Insights on Transitioning from Back-End Engineering to iOS APP Development

```markdown
"Isn't programming all pretty much the same?" It's like a different world...
In the beginning, having someone to guide you can speed things up, as many concepts differ from web development. You'll go through a period of hitting a wall, but if you hang in there, you'll see the light of success!
I also hit a wall for almost a month. Once you have a bit of context, you'll encounter a **second wall-hitting period**. At this time, you need to be resilient and learn from your mistakes, trading time for experience (if you're short on time, I recommend taking an introductory course or finding a mentor).
- **Development Environment**: In the past, when writing PHP, we would use Sublime, hit Ctrl+S, then Ctrl+Tab to switch to the browser and Ctrl+R to quickly see the results; now, you have to use Xcode and deploy to a simulator or a phone to see the results. This part is just right to help improve my impatient personality XD.
- **Language Aspect**: Swift is more modern, strongly typed, and more structured. You might not be used to it at first, but once you get the hang of it, there won't be much of a problem.
- **Storyboard/Interface Builder**: This part lowers the entry barrier for beginners. If you have to use code to create interfaces from the start, it will be much harder to learn; you can directly visualize and manipulate the UI, learn layout, and create outlets.
- **Memory and Page Layout Structure**: This is something that requires more attention, and it's part of what I mean by trading time for experience. In the past, there were no limits when making web pages; you could do whatever you wanted. For example, to create a table, you would just write `<table>` and run a PHP loop to display the data. However, in an app, you need to use the UITableView component to implement it (I remember using UIView to lay it out and happily telling my supervisor that I was done! Only to find out that the memory exploded).
You also need to pay more attention to memory leaks!
- **Application Launch**: App development requires more caution, and testing needs to be more meticulous; unlike web pages where you can just fix mistakes, iOS app versions need to go through review, and you can't downgrade even if there are bugs. So, fixing a bug can take at least a day, which greatly impacts users!
- **User Feedback**: Users can give you the most direct feedback.

Life is interesting because it is full of uncertainties. When opportunities arise, if you choose to seize them, you will gain something; if you choose to let go, the next opportunity may be even better. There is no right or wrong; just trust your instincts: "Choose what you love, love what you choose."
#### Expectations for Myself

I am still quite inexperienced and will continue to roll in iOS app development, learning, growing, and seeking breakthroughs for the future, while maintaining the habit of writing on Medium. What will the next opportunity be? I am also looking forward to it!
