#### Murmur

The original intention of running Medium was not to make money, but to enjoy sharing with everyone—the feeling of sharing technical difficulties encountered, hoping to help developers with similar issues avoid detours, or to delve deeper based on my research, from which I can also learn new knowledge; plus, there are very few Traditional Chinese writers, so I hope to inspire a cycle of mutual teaching and learning.

Therefore, I have always viewed the potential for articles to generate profit with indifference; whether it exists or not is fine. If it does, I can use the earnings to experiment, purchase more services or experiences, and then rewrite them into articles to share with everyone, creating a rolling cycle.

Since I started writing on Medium in 2018, I was aware of the Medium Partner Program. However, year after year—2018, 2019, 2020—the policies of the Medium Partner Program had not been updated, and it was still limited to a few regions where writers could profit \(I remember only Singapore and Japan in Asia...\). For writers outside these regions, earning revenue was quite [troublesome](https://medium.com/tenzblog/%E5%9C%A8%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%8A%A0%E5%85%A5medium%E4%BB%98%E8%B2%BB%E7%89%86%E7%9A%84%E6%9A%AB%E8%A1%8C%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95-6be1d0d999aa){:target="_blank"}, requiring a VPN to connect to an allowed region + needing an account or phone from that region, which I found too troublesome and unsafe after some research.

As a result, many creators switched to other platforms, such as Matters, 方格子, or self-hosting with ads for profit. Over the years, Medium has indeed lost many Chinese creators.
#### Medium Partner Program

Until recently, in August 2024, I accidentally spotted a banner in the Medium backend inviting me to join the Partner Program \(I thought, What? It's still not open for Taiwan\). After clicking in, I was surprised to find that it is now fully open, and creators from almost all regions can join the Partner Program to earn revenue from their own articles, word by word.


> _But it's a bit funny that to join the Medium Partner Program and make money, you first need to spend money to become a Medium Member \(with a minimum monthly fee of $4\)._
