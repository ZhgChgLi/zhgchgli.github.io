#### Murmur

The original intention of running Medium was not to make money, but to enjoy sharing with everyone—the feeling of sharing technical difficulties encountered, hoping to help developers with similar issues avoid unnecessary detours, or to delve deeper into my research, allowing me to learn new knowledge in the process. Additionally, since there are very few Traditional Chinese writers, I hoped to spark a cycle of mutual teaching and learning.

Thus, I have always viewed the potential for articles to generate profit with indifference; whether it exists or not is fine. If it does, I can use the earnings to experiment, purchase more services or experiences, and then write articles to share with everyone, creating a rolling cycle.

Since I started writing on Medium in 2018, I was aware of the Medium Partner Program. However, year after year—2018, 2019, 2020—the policies of the Medium Partner Program remained unchanged, consistently limiting profit opportunities to writers from only a few regions \(I remember only Singapore and Japan in Asia\). Writers from other regions faced significant [challenges](https://medium.com/tenzblog/%E5%9C%A8%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%8A%A0%E5%85%A5medium%E4%BB%98%E8%B2%BB%E7%89%86%E7%9A%84%E6%9A%AB%E8%A1%8C%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95-6be1d0d999aa){:target="_blank"} to earn revenue, needing to use a VPN to access allowed regions and requiring accounts or phones from those areas. After some research, I found it too troublesome and unsafe.

As a result, many creators migrated to other platforms like Matters, 方格子, or set up their own sites to earn through ads. Over the years, Medium has indeed lost many Chinese creators.
#### Medium Partner Program

Until recently, in August 2024, I accidentally spotted a banner in the Medium backend inviting me to join the Partner Program \(I thought, What? It's still not open to Taiwan\). After clicking in, I was surprised to discover that it is now fully open, allowing creators from almost all regions to join the Partner Program and earn revenue through their own articles, word by word.


> _It's a bit funny, though; before you can join the Medium Partner Program to earn money, you first need to spend money to become a Medium Member \(with a minimum monthly fee of $4\)._
