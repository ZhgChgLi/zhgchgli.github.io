#### Murmur

The original intention of running Medium was not to make money but to enjoy sharing with others—sharing technical challenges encountered, hoping to help developers with similar issues avoid detours, or deepening my own research from which I can also learn new knowledge. Additionally, since there are few Traditional Chinese writers, I hope to set an example and create a cycle of mutual learning.

So I have never been too concerned about whether articles can generate profit or not. If there is profit, great; if not, that's fine too. If there is, I can use the earnings to experiment, buy more services or experiences, and then turn those into articles to share with everyone, creating a virtuous cycle.

Since I started writing on Medium in 2018, I have known about the Medium Partner Program. However, from 2018, 2019, 2020… year after year, the Medium Partner Program policy had no updates and only allowed writers from a few regions (I remember only Singapore and Japan in Asia) to join and earn revenue. For writers outside these regions, earning was very [troublesome](https://medium.com/tenzblog/%E5%9C%A8%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%8A%A0%E5%85%A5medium%E4%BB%98%E8%B2%BB%E7%89%86%E7%9A%84%E6%9A%AB%E8%A1%8C%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95-6be1d0d999aa){:target="_blank"}, requiring a VPN to connect to allowed regions plus having an account or phone number from those regions. I researched a bit before but found it too troublesome and unsafe.

Many creators have switched to other platforms like Matters, Fanggezi, or set up their own sites with ads for revenue. In recent years, Medium has indeed lost many Chinese-speaking creators.

#### Medium Partner Program

Until recently in August 2024, I accidentally saw an invitation banner in Medium's backend to join the Partner Program (I thought, "What? Taiwan still isn't allowed"). After clicking and checking, I was surprised to find that it is now fully open. Creators from almost all regions can join the Partner Program and earn revenue word by word through their articles.

> *It's a bit funny that before you can join the Medium Partner Program to earn money, you first need to spend money to become a Medium Member (at least $4 per month).*

#### Medium Custom Domain Feature

Recently, Medium has been adding more features. Another feature that was once available, then closed, the custom domain, has now reopened.

![[Medium Custom Domain Feature Returns](../d9a95d4224ea/)](/assets/cefdf4d41746/1*IdKpBZZx1y79GVCGElkdnA.jpeg)

[Medium Custom Domain Feature Returns](../d9a95d4224ea/)

You can refer to my previous article "[Medium Custom Domain Feature Returns](../d9a95d4224ea/)" to register your own domain and link it to Medium.

- **Effect: <https://blog.zhgchg.li>{:target="_blank"}**

> *The custom domain feature also requires you to be a Medium Member to use.*

#### Payment Method & Tax Issues

- Payment Method: Directly through **[Stripe](https://wise.com/zh-hk/blog/stripe-vs-paypal#stripe-vs-paypal%E8%B2%BB%E7%94%A8%E6%AF%94%E8%BC%83){:target="_blank"}**, which is similar to Paypal but with lower fees and more focused on payment processing.

- Tax Issues: Non-US citizens only need to fill out a declaration form.

### Some Thoughts on Paywall Paid Articles

- Once an article is behind the Paywall and becomes a paid article, users must log in and join Medium Member paid membership to read the full content. The previously circulated unlimited monthly reading hacks are no longer effective.

- My high-traffic, SEO-friendly articles are mostly unboxings and travelogues; however, the readers are mostly casual visitors, not even regular Medium Members, let alone paying members. They just browse and leave, so these types of articles are not suitable for Paywall.

- Technical articles are often shared freely because the information is meant to be open and the authors don't see their content as valuable. Also, since the traffic is mostly industry insiders, there is little motivation to add a Paywall.  
  **Or simultaneously provide a free link so that non-Medium Members can also read it.**

- Traffic and revenue results can be referenced from [Tenz Shih](https://medium.com/u/11162699a102){:target="_blank"}'s early [shared data](https://medium.com/tenzblog/%E5%8A%A0%E5%85%A5medium-payment-program%E4%B8%80%E6%98%9F%E6%9C%9F%E5%B7%A6%E5%8F%B3%E7%9A%84%E6%94%B6%E5%85%A5%E6%83%85%E5%BD%A2-dad68b457d64){:target="_blank"}.

- I have selected several technical articles with good traffic and content to add to the Paywall for testing (a free link is included in the first paragraph, so readers without an account or payment can still view it). I will update the results later for your reference.

- Previously, I had already migrated to [Self-hosted + Google Adsense](https://zhgchg.li){:target="_blank"} using a custom tool for conversion: "[Seamless Migration from Medium to Self-hosted Site](../a0c08d579ab1/)." However, I didn't consider paid articles at that time, so I need to adjust the script again QQ.

### Adding Articles to the Paywall to Start Earning Revenue

Note that joining the Medium Partner Program alone does not generate earnings; articles must be placed behind a Paywall to receive revenue shares.

![](/assets/cefdf4d41746/1*qudLUHY7JqphRC_FAodk8g.png)

- Article Editing -> "Manage paywall setting"

![](/assets/cefdf4d41746/1*_ySM_z4wMTd4xYCaJIVtmw.png)

![](/assets/cefdf4d41746/1*n4gRDzM7X0_ISV3gMYSe6w.png)

- Check "Paywall your story" -> "Save"

- Articles participating in revenue sharing will have a ⭐️.

This way, the article will generate revenue sharing.

#### Free Viewing Link

![](/assets/cefdf4d41746/1*wUh3kXVOBsP0eVqflA8sRw.png)

- If you want to let a friend view the full article for free, you can choose "Copy Friend Link" from Share. This link allows free full access but will not generate any earnings.

### View Performance Report

![](/assets/cefdf4d41746/1*dckrz_jFSeodLSm2w6_zYA.png)

![https://medium.com/me/partner/dashboard](/assets/cefdf4d41746/1*LKHddq49OOoMrqdbZ8yN9Q.png)

https://medium.com/me/partner/dashboard

[Medium Partner Dashboard](https://medium.com/me/partner/dashboard){:target="_blank"} or Story Stats will now show the Earnings amount.

![](/assets/cefdf4d41746/1*TNnWWsYxCW55uR-9NxEsNw.png)

The detailed article report will also show how many paying members have read it.

### Results of This Article

This article was behind a Paywall from the moment it was published (now removed). Here is a summary of the results after one month.

### $0.90

Earnings

### 201

Views

### 82

Reads

### 41%

Read ratio

Observing that only the number of Reads (paid users staying to read over 30 seconds) generates revenue, the payout amount is not fixed. It seems to be allocated based on views, claps, shares, etc. My counts are low, so each Read earns about $0.01 to $0.07.

The above data is provided for your reference.
