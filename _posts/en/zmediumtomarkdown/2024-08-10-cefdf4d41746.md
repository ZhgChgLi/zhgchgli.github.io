### The Medium Partner Program is Finally Open to Writers Worldwide (Including Taiwan)!

Anyone can join the Medium Partner Program to write articles and earn revenue.

#### Murmur

The original intention of running Medium was not to make money, but to enjoy sharing with everyone, sharing the technical difficulties encountered, hoping to help developers with similar issues avoid detours, or to delve deeper based on my research, from which I can also learn new knowledge; plus, there are very few Traditional Chinese writers, so I hope to create a cycle of mutual teaching and learning.

Therefore, I have always viewed the ability to monetize articles with indifference; whether there is profit or not is fine. If there is, I can use the earnings to experiment, purchase more services or experiences, and then write articles to share with everyone, creating a rolling cycle.

Since I started writing on Medium in 2018, I have known that Medium has a Partner Program. However, year after year from 2018, 2019, 2020… the policies of the Medium Partner Program have not been updated, and it has only limited writers from a few regions (I remember only Singapore and Japan in Asia…) to join and earn; writers from other regions have found it very [troublesome](https://medium.com/tenzblog/%E5%9C%A8%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%8A%A0%E5%85%A5medium%E4%BB%98%E8%B2%BB%E7%89%86%E7%9A%84%E6%9A%AB%E8%A1%8C%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95-6be1d0d999aa){:target="_blank"}, needing a VPN to connect to allowed regions + needing an account or phone from that region, which I found too troublesome and unsafe after some research.

As a result, many creators have switched to other platforms, such as Matters, Fanggez, or self-hosting with ads for profit. Over the past few years, Medium has indeed lost many Chinese creators.
#### Medium Partner Program

Until recently, in August 2024, I accidentally saw a banner in the Medium backend inviting me to join the Partner Program (I thought, What? It's still not open for Taiwan), and after clicking in, I was surprised to find that it is now fully open, allowing creators from almost all regions to join the Partner Program and earn revenue through their articles word by word.

> _But it's a bit funny that before you can join the Medium Partner Program to earn money, you first need to spend money to join as a Medium Member (the minimum is $4 per month)._
