#### Murmur

The original intention of running Medium is not to make money, but to enjoy sharing with everyone—sharing technical difficulties encountered, hoping to help developers with similar problems avoid detours, or deepening my own research to learn new knowledge; moreover, there are few Traditional Chinese writers, so I hope to inspire others and create a cycle of mutual learning through teaching.

So I have always been indifferent about whether the article can generate profit or not. If it does, great; if not, that's fine too. If there is profit, I can use it to experiment, purchase more services or experiences, and then rewrite them into articles to share with everyone, creating a continuous cycle.

Since I started writing on Medium in 2018, I have known about the Medium Partner Program. However, from 2018, 2019, 2020… year after year, the Medium Partner Program policy has not been updated. It has always limited writers from only a few regions (I remember only Singapore and Japan in Asia…) to join and earn revenue. For writers outside these regions, earning money is very [troublesome](https://medium.com/tenzblog/%E5%9C%A8%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%8A%A0%E5%85%A5medium%E4%BB%98%E8%B2%BB%E7%89%86%E7%9A%84%E6%9A%AB%E8%A1%8C%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95-6be1d0d999aa){:target="_blank"}; it requires using a VPN to connect to an allowed region plus having an account or phone number from that region. I researched this before but found it too troublesome and unsafe.

As a result, many creators have switched to other platforms such as Matters, Fanggezi, or set up their own sites to earn through ads. In recent years, Medium has indeed lost many Chinese creators.

#### Medium Partner Program

Until recently, in August 2024, I accidentally saw a banner in the Medium backend inviting me to join the Partner Program (I thought, What? It's still not open to Taiwan). After clicking in, I was surprised to find that it is now fully open, and creators from almost all regions can join the Partner Program to earn revenue from every word of their articles.

> *But funny enough, to join the Medium Partner Program and earn money, you first need to pay to become a Medium Member (at least $4 per month).*
