### How to Shop from Japan and Ship to Taiwan — Using Rakuten Forwarding to Buy from Rakuten Auctions and Amazon (Horie Titanium Cup) with Delivery in as Fast as 4 Days

Buying what you want yourself: A record and guide on purchasing Japanese products using Rakuten Shipping to Taiwan, using the Horie titanium cup as an example.

### [Horie Titanium Cup](https://a.r10.to/hkPx9m){:target="_blank"}

The main features of the Horie titanium cup that burned me last time in Japan:

![[Official Horie Rakuten Store](https://a.r10.to/hkPx9m){:target="_blank"}](/assets/bea62c251f1b/1*7m-tH8lB3Sx0yxtdc9Bn_g.png)

[Official Horie Rakuten Store](https://a.r10.to/hkPx9m){:target="_blank"}

- Exclusive oxidation coloring technique creates vibrant, dazzling patterns with a variety of color options.

- Exclusive double-layer insulation structure keeps cold drinks sweat-free and hot drinks safe to touch.

- Exclusive special inner cup design that automatically creates long-lasting dense foam when drinking beer.

- Narrow cup rim prevents lip cuts.

- Pure titanium material, very lightweight, antibacterial, and odor-free.

What attracted me the most were the first three exclusive technologies **＋ that it is a thermos cup**. Besides, I don’t have any titanium cups at the moment, and I’m troubled by the lingering odor issue in thermos cups, so I really want to buy one to try.

#### **Item to Purchase:**

> *Brand: Horie Titanium Cup*

> *Model: Kiln-made Booster / 400ml*

> *Style: G4B*

[Official Price](https://a.r10.to/hkPx9m){:target="_blank"} **¥19,800 JPY (about NT $4,080 TWD)**, free shipping within Japan.

I checked the prices in Taiwan; whether on e-commerce platforms or from individual sellers, they are around NT$5,500. Occasionally, group buys or exhibition events offer prices around NT$4,200, which makes it worth buying.

### Total Time and Cost of Rakuten Consolidated Shipping

The result is stated upfront.

![](/assets/bea62c251f1b/1*n3ahp0WYgvO36vendy3GEQ.png)

- Because I needed engraving, it took 7–10 days to produce. Additionally, I bought magazines, which added waiting time for the magazines to arrive at Rakuten Consolidation.

- Looking solely at the shipping time, the consolidation center received the goods in just 1 day, and it took only 3 days from packing to delivery—truly very fast!

- Total cost including shipping: NT $4,744. (See details in the article; shipping is higher due to small purchase quantity)

### [Rakuten Global Express — Rakuten Global Express](https://secure.globalexpress.rakuten.co.jp/mypage/register/invite?key=a6nn9r3fq6j4sskcsOrXE%2Bgdygp0zER%2FMe83%2FUDPw6k7LFkMFZBfgN0hX48E%3D){:target="_blank"}

Since I was going to buy from Japan's Rakuten Market anyway, I decided to try Rakuten's forwarding service; of course, Rakuten forwarding is not limited to Rakuten purchases only. Other e-commerce platforms such as Amazon Japan (Amazon JP), Japan Yahoo Shopping / Yahoo Auctions, Mercari, Biccamera, and more can also be shipped.

- You can earn Rakuten points and use them for payment!

10/14 Requested Rakuten shipping, received it on 10/16!

![](/assets/bea62c251f1b/1*LnzDj0-qp5JrhXe40RiewQ.png)

The two cups plus one magazine actually fit in a small box.

![](/assets/bea62c251f1b/1*x7NZZf3oWLDLAqZzktyYoA.png)

Covered with Japanese-style warning stickers.

![](/assets/bea62c251f1b/1*Rub-oAEfRnZjpn4eIAhPHg.png)

The reinforced box for international shipping means adding this cardboard box plus shockproof paper packaging around and at the bottom.

![](/assets/bea62c251f1b/1*sR3X_vfh6_7VH8x7jTA4GQ.png)

![](/assets/bea62c251f1b/1*a2ZQxQbXhyFm790bAqnZ4Q.png)

The above is the magazine bought from Amazon (the paper packaging was damaged during shipping, but the contents are intact), and below is the Horie titanium cup.

![](/assets/bea62c251f1b/1*jDdIWaMN0U_l0KrULJjk7g.png)

![](/assets/bea62c251f1b/1*ZVCaomYElKOQktBAGerrkg.png)

Contents: 2 titanium cups.

### [Horie Titanium Cup](https://a.r10.to/hkPx9m){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/bea62c251f1b/1*EZAkrzE5WkIEF0YMSoT3CA.jpeg)

The overall colors, patterns, and gradients are very vivid and magical, beautifully surreal.

![](/assets/bea62c251f1b/1*F_L3JKPr1kd-Ljs9c2TA2Q.jpeg)

Open a bottle of draft beer immediately and add ice to test. The ice retention is indeed good, the beer has fine bubbles, tastes great, **and it really doesn’t sweat**.

### Final Cost Calculation

- [Horie Titanium Cup](https://a.r10.to/hkPx9m){:target="_blank"} Kiln-Made Booster / 400ml ¥19,800 — NT $4,079

- Shipping cost per person: NT$665

- Customs Duty: Not charged

Total: NT $4,744 purchased.

> ***Because titanium cups are very light, it makes sense to find a few people to buy together and share the shipping cost. This could bring the price down to around NT4,200. I only bought two, so the shipping cost was a bit expensive.***

> Of course, the best deal is still to buy directly at Japanese department stores and get a tax refund! The estimated price is around NT$3,600.
