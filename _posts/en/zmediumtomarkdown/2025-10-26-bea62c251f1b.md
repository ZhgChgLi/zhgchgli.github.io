  & Amazon

### How to Shop from Japan and Ship to Taiwan — Using Rakuten Shipping to Buy Rakuten Market and Amazon Products (Horie Titanium Cup) with Delivery in as Fast as 4 Days

Buying what you want yourself: A record and guide for using Rakuten Shipping to purchase Japanese products and ship them back to Taiwan, using the Horie titanium cup as an example.

### [Horie Titanium Cup](https://a.r10.to/hkPx9m){:target="_blank"}

The main features of the Horie titanium cup that impressed me during my last trip to Japan:

![[Official Horie Rakuten Store](https://a.r10.to/hkPx9m){:target="_blank"}](/assets/bea62c251f1b/1*7m-tH8lB3Sx0yxtdc9Bn_g.png)

[Official Horie Rakuten Store](https://a.r10.to/hkPx9m){:target="_blank"}

- Exclusive oxidation coloring pattern technology, offering vibrant and brilliant colors with multiple options

- Exclusive double-layer insulation structure keeps drinks cold without condensation and hot without burning hands

- Exclusive special inner cup surface design that automatically creates long-lasting dense foam when drinking beer

- Narrow cup opening that won’t scratch your lips

- Made of pure titanium, very light, antibacterial, and odor-free

What attracted me the most were the first three exclusive technologies **＋ it is a thermos cup**. Besides, I don't have any titanium cups yet, and I’m troubled by the lingering smell problem of thermos cups, so I really want to buy one to try.

#### **Product to Purchase:**

> *Brand: Horie Titanium Cup*

> *Model: Kiln-made Booster / 400ml*

> *Style: G4B*

[Official price](https://a.r10.to/hkPx9m){:target="_blank"} **¥19,800 yen (about NT $4,080 TWD)**, free shipping within Japan.

I checked the prices in Taiwan, and whether on e-commerce platforms or from individual sellers, they are around NT $5,500. Occasionally, group buys or exhibition events can lower the price to about NT $4,200, which is a good deal to buy.

### Total Time and Cost for Rakuten Forwarding Consolidation Shipping to Taiwan

The result is stated upfront.

![](/assets/bea62c251f1b/1*n3ahp0WYgvO36vendy3GEQ.png)

- Because I needed engraving, it took 7–10 days to produce. Also, I bought magazines, so I had to wait for them to arrive at the Rakuten forwarding center.

- Looking at the transit time alone, it took only 1 day for the transfer station to receive the goods, and just 3 days from packing to delivery—truly very fast!

- Total cost including shipping: NT $4,744. (See details in the article; shipping is higher due to the small purchase.)

### [Rakuten Global Express](https://secure.globalexpress.rakuten.co.jp/mypage/register/invite?key=a6nn9r3fq6j4sskcsOrXE%2Bgdygp0zER%2FMe83%2FUDPw6k7LFkMFZBfgN0hX48E%3D){:target="_blank"}

Since I was already buying from Japan's Rakuten Ichiba, I decided to try Rakuten's forwarding/consolidation service. Of course, Rakuten forwarding is not limited to Rakuten purchases; other e-commerce platforms like Amazon JP, Yahoo Shopping / Yahoo Auctions Japan, Mercari, Biccamera, and more can also be shipped.

- You can earn Rakuten points and use them for payment!

#### Special Protection When Using Rakuten Shipping to Purchase Rakuten Products

In addition to providing forwarding/consolidation services, **using Rakuten** forwarding to **purchase items from Rakuten Ichiba** also offers the following guarantees:

10/14 Requested shipment from Rakuten forwarding, received on 10/16!

Cover with Japanese-style warning stickers.

![](/assets/bea62c251f1b/1*Rub-oAEfRnZjpn4eIAhPHg.png)

The reinforced box for international shipping includes this cardboard box plus shockproof paper packaging around the sides and bottom.

![](/assets/bea62c251f1b/1*sR3X_vfh6_7VH8x7jTA4GQ.png)

![](/assets/bea62c251f1b/1*a2ZQxQbXhyFm790bAqnZ4Q.png)

The above is a magazine bought from Amazon (the paper packaging was torn during shipping, but the contents are intact). Below is the Horie titanium cup.

![](/assets/bea62c251f1b/1*ZVCaomYElKOQktBAGerrkg.png)

Contents: 2 titanium cups.

![](/assets/bea62c251f1b/1*EZAkrzE5WkIEF0YMSoT3CA.jpeg)

The overall colors, patterns, and gradients are very vivid and magical, creating an unreal beauty.

![](/assets/bea62c251f1b/1*F_L3JKPr1kd-Ljs9c2TA2Q.jpeg)

Open a bottle of draft beer immediately and add ice to test. The ice retention is indeed good, the beer has a creamy foam, tastes great, **and it really doesn't sweat**.

### Final Cost Calculation

- [Horie Titanium Cup](https://a.r10.to/hkPx9m){:target="_blank"} Kiln-made Booster / 400ml ¥19,800 — NT $4,079

- Shipping cost per person: NT$665

- Customs Duty: Not Charged

Total: NT $4,744 spent.

> ***Because titanium cups are very light, it’s a good idea to find a few people to buy together and share the shipping cost. This can reduce the price to about NT4,200. I only bought two, so the shipping cost felt a bit high.***

> Of course, the best deal is to buy directly at a Japanese department store and get a tax refund! The estimated price is around NT$ 3,600.
