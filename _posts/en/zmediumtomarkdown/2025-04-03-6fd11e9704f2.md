### **A Milestone of 1,000 Followers On Medium**

Running Medium for 7 years, with 112 articles totaling about 130,000 words, and investing over 800 hours, I finally achieved my dream goal on April 2, 2025 — 1,000 Followers.

It’s a long story. Since 2018, I shifted from Web to App development. Everything was new to me, and I always had a thirst for knowledge. I constantly researched on my own, learning while doing, and eventually completed and launched my first App.

Since I was entirely self-taught, I benefited greatly from many online articles left by predecessors. This inspired me to write articles to promote mutual learning, hoping to create a positive cycle myself.

At first, I was caught in the "sharing dilemma," always worried that the content wasn’t complete enough, feared criticism, and was even more afraid it wouldn’t help readers at all.  
But later, I realized that writing an article is like planting a seed. One day, a developer facing a similar problem might find help in my article or use it as a starting point for deeper exploration.  
Even if the content might not be seen by many, if I don’t start, these wonderful possibilities will never happen. It’s by continuously persisting in writing that I gradually improved my skills, enriched my content, and increased the chances of helping others.

During that period, I caught the wave of the times as apps and software engineering flourished. I continuously learned, developed new features, and transformed my experiences into articles to share. At the same time, fresh talents kept joining the development team, so each post always gained new followers.

In recent years, with the industry cooling down, the impact of AI on digital content creation, and changes in Medium's SEO policies, the growth of new followers has clearly slowed. I have adopted a more relaxed attitude toward reaching the "1K goal," but I still maintain the original spirit of sharing, continuing to document and help friends facing similar issues.  
Additionally, I have started sharing some daily life, travel journals, unboxing posts, and personal interests related to automation (RPA).

1K is just a milestone. I look forward to your continued support in the future.  
Whether or not I continue writing about iOS development, I will keep sharing the problems I encounter and the lessons I learn.

Sincerely thank you all for your support and companionship over the past 7 years!

After seven years on Medium, publishing 112 articles, about 130,000 words, and spending over 800 hours, I finally reached my long-awaited milestone of 1,000 followers on April 2, 2025.

It’s been quite a journey. Back in 2018, when I switched my focus from web development to app development, everything felt new and exciting. With an insatiable curiosity, I constantly searched for resources, learned by doing, and eventually completed and published my first app.

As someone entirely self-taught, I gained a tremendous amount from online articles shared by many experienced developers. This inspired me to start writing myself, motivated by the concept of “learning by teaching,” hoping to create a positive cycle of knowledge sharing.

Initially, I was caught up in doubts about sharing — always concerned whether my content was thorough enough, whether I’d be criticized, or even worse, whether it provided no real value to readers.

Eventually, I shifted my mindset. Writing is like planting a seed — someday, a developer facing a similar problem might find help or inspiration through my posts. Even if my articles weren’t immediately noticed, if I never started writing, those opportunities would never arise. Through continuous writing and persistence, I gradually improved my skills, enriched my content, and increased its potential to help others.

Fortunately, I rode the wave of rapid growth in apps and software engineering. Day after day, I learned, built new features, and shared my experiences through writing. There was also a steady influx of new developers entering the field, and each article brought new followers.

In recent years, growth has notably slowed, impacted by industry cooling, AI-driven changes to digital content creation, and shifts in Medium’s SEO policies. Gradually, I adopted a more relaxed approach towards reaching the 1,000-follower mark. Yet, I never lost the initial passion for sharing and continued documenting my experiences to help those encountering similar issues. Additionally, I started sharing daily life stories, travel experiences, product reviews, and content about my personal interest in automation (RPA).

Reaching 1,000 followers is just a milestone, and I look forward to your continued support in the future. Regardless of whether I continue writing about iOS development, I’ll keep sharing the problems I encounter and the knowledge I gain.

I sincerely thank everyone for your support and companionship over these past seven years!
