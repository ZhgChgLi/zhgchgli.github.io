### Introduction

In response to the shift to full remote work, the company is concerned about the health of all members, requiring daily reports on any health issues to be recorded and managed by People Operations.
#### Our Flow Before Optimization


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*brnD44gjwyWEyK14dQYfxQ.jpeg)

1. \[Automation\] Slack Channel sends a reminder message about the health form every day at 10 AM (the only automated part before optimization)
2. Employees click the link to open the Google Form and fill out health questions
3. Data is stored back in Google Sheets for response records
4. \[Manual\] People Operations compares the list daily near the end of the workday to identify employees who forgot to fill it out
5. \[Manual\] Sends reminder messages in the Slack Channel & tags each person who forgot to fill it out



> _The above is our company's health reporting tracking process. Each company will have different processes based on its size and operational methods. This article serves only as an optimization example to learn about using Slack Workflow and basic App Script writing; actual implementation should be done on a case-by-case basis._ 




#### Issues
- Employees need to exit the Slack context to open the Google Form in a browser, which is especially inconvenient on mobile devices
- Google Form can only automatically populate the email message, and cannot automatically include the respondent's name or department information
- Daily manual comparisons and tagging are very time-consuming and labor-intensive

#### Solution

Having done quite a few small automation projects, this process has a fixed data source (employee list), simple conditions, and routine actions; it seemed very suitable for automation. Initially, I didn't implement it because I couldn't find a good way to fill it out (actually, I couldn't find an interesting point to study); so I left it aside until I saw [Prime Minister Hai's post](https://www.facebook.com/tzangms/posts/10157880898787657){:target="_blank"} and realized that Slack Workflow can do more than just scheduled messaging; it also has form functionality:


![Image from: [Prime Minister Hai](https://www.facebook.com/tzangms/posts/10157880898787657){:target="_blank"}](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*yKBpGlHEVMj4QbjGuB7aHQ.jpeg)

Image from: [Prime Minister Hai](https://www.facebook.com/tzangms/posts/10157880898787657){:target="_blank"}

Now I was eager to get started!!

If I could combine Slack Workflow Forms with automated messaging, wouldn't that solve **all the pain points** mentioned above? The principle is feasible! So I began to implement it.
#### Flow After Optimization


First, let's review the optimized process and results.


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*jT5dAICg85lyCF0sJwk8bQ.png)

1. \[Automation\] The Slack Channel sends a reminder about the health form every day at 10 AM.
2. Fill out health questions from Google Form or Slack Workflow Form.
3. All data is stored back in the Google Sheet response record.
4. People Operations clicks the "Generate Unfilled List" button near the end of the workday.
5. \[Automation\] Use App Script to compare the employee list and the filled list to filter out the unfilled list.
6. \[Automation\] Click "Generate & Send Message" to automatically send reminders for unfilled forms and automatically tag the relevant individuals.
7. Work is done!

#### Effectiveness

\(Personal Estimate\)
- Each employee can reduce filling time by about 30 seconds daily.
- People Operations can save about 20 to 30 minutes daily on this task.

### Operating Principle


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*xbZD2kkoYvWifQv8qyV_MQ.png)


Manage the Sheet through writing App Script.
1. Store all externally input data in the Responses Sheet.
2. Write an App Script Function to distribute the data from Responses to each date's Sheet according to the filling date; if none exists, create a new date Sheet, using the date as the Sheet name for easy identification.
3. Compare the current date's Sheet with the employee list to generate the data for the unfilled list Sheet.
4. Read the unfilled list Sheet, compose the message, and send it to the designated Slack Channel.

- Integrate with the Slack APP API to automatically read the specified Channel and import the employee list.
- Use the Slack UID Tag `<@UID>` in the message content to tag unfilled members.

#### Identity Verification

The identity verification information linking Google Form and Slack is the Email, so please ensure that all company colleagues use their company Email to fill out the Google Form, and that the Slack personal information section also includes their company Email.
### Let's Get Started

After discussing the issues, optimization methods, and results, we now move on to the implementation phase; let’s complete this automation case step by step together.


> _The content is a bit lengthy; feel free to skip sections you already understand, or directly create a copy from the completed results to learn while viewing and modifying._ 





Completed Result Form: [https://forms\.gle/aqGDCELpAiMFFoyDA](https://forms.gle/aqGDCELpAiMFFoyDA){:target="_blank"}

Completed Result Google Sheet:

#### Create a Health Reporting Google Form & Link Responses to Google Sheet

Steps are omitted; if you have questions, please Google directly. Here, we assume you have already created and linked the health reporting form.

**Remember to check "Collect emails" in the form:**


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*DKVg1oWvx0p2K_aYslK5ZQ.png)


Collect the email addresses of the respondents for later comparison.

**How to link responses to Google Sheet?**


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*Ie0WvV5zWNubaYq_hBbeNw.jpeg)


Switch to "Responses" at the top of the form and click the "Google Sheet Icon."

**Change the linked Sheet name:**


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*1A3m2zx1hI039TgWt3iU5A.png)


It is recommended to change the linked Sheet name from Form Responses 1 to Responses for easier use.
#### Create a Slack Workflow Form Entry

After establishing the traditional Google Form entry, let’s add a Slack filling method.


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*pkCpzbA6YLORazNfQS2ntA.jpeg)



In any Slack conversation window, find the " **Input box below** " and click on the "blue lightning ⚡️".

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*GpUOoQ2b_W7bMeeOlkosoA.jpeg)

In the menu, type "workflow" under "Search shortcuts" and select "Open Workflow Builder".

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*qgt-WjyrG_5OtaUjjt6r9Q.jpeg)

Here, you will see the Workflows you have created or participated in. Click on the "Create" button in the upper right corner to create a new Workflow.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*3qUC2S7sskImnDmXcnqMtg.jpeg)

First, enter the workflow name (for display in the Workflow Builder interface).

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*q94eI0z8ljhBrjrPEGWa8w.jpeg)

For the Workflow trigger method, select "Shortcut".

Currently, there are 5 types of Slack workflow trigger points:
- Shortcut: Manually trigger the "blue lightning ⚡️" option, which will appear in the workflow menu; click to start the workflow.
- New channel member: When a new member joins the Target Channel... (EX: welcome message)
- Emoji reactions: When someone presses a specified emoji on a message in the Target Channel... (perhaps to mark important messages as read by pressing XXX Emoji, to know who has read it?)
- Scheduled date & time: Scheduling, when the specified time arrives... (EX: scheduled reminder message)
- Webhook: External Webhook trigger, an advanced feature that can connect with third-party or self-hosted APIs to integrate internal workflows.

Here, we choose "Shortcut" to create a manual trigger option.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*2NEcjJtkDwuQtF-DmnhgOg.jpeg)

Select which "Channel input box" this Workflow Shortcut should be added under and enter the "display name".

> \*A workflow shortcut can only be added to one channel.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*Qq-nJr66qoGsXxhPEsUhWw.jpeg)

Shortcut created! Start building the workflow steps by clicking "Add Step".

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*aUerPfBPlOhkNGoeiougGA.jpeg)

Select the "Send a form" Step.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*DBPCTHNyKBuJIvEJCyexyg.png)

**Title**: Enter the form title.

**Add a question**: Enter the title of the first question (you can label the question numbers in the title, e.g., 1., 2., 3…).

**Choose a question type**:
- Short answer: Single line input box.
- Long answer: Multi-line input box.
- Select from a list: Single choice list.
- Select a person: Choose a member within the same Workspace.
- Select a channel or DM: Choose a member within the same Workspace or Group DM or Channel.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*pYIUTLaHVzHzFkAypN2_sw.png)

Taking "Select from a list" as an example:
1. Add list item: You can add an option.
2. Default selection: Choose the default option.
3. Make this required: Set this question as mandatory.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*hb1l9_E8EmHgUqIvHuBqhw.png)

1. Add Question: You can add more questions.
2. The arrows on the right "↓" "⬆" can adjust the order, and "✎" can expand for editing.
3. You can choose whether to send the form responses back to the Channel or to someone.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*WsHqG3hxgivNfFXakMgVrQ.png)

You can also choose to send replies to...:
- Person who clicked ...: The person who clicked this form (equivalent to the person filling it out).
- Channel where workflow started: The Channel to which this workflow was added.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*xyrdyrx9ACpWTcjAtG-rTQ.png)

After completing the form, click "Save" to save the step.

> *Here, we uncheck the option to return the filled form content because we want to customize the message content in the subsequent steps.

#### Connect Slack workflow form with Google Sheet

If you haven't added the Google Sheet App to Slack yet, you can [click here to install the APP](https://slack.com/apps/A01AWGA48G6-google-sheets-for-workflow-builder){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*da6ofGd-N0NsBs4LNDsllQ.png)

Continuing from the previous step, click "Add Step" to add a new step. We choose the "Add a spreadsheet row" step from Google Sheets for Workflow Builder.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*6h_t9tPiam735pth-n0AOw.png)

1. First, you need to authorize your Google account by clicking "Connect account."
2. Select a spreadsheet: Choose the target Google Sheet for responses; please select the Google Sheet associated with the Google Form you created initially.
3. Sheet: Same as above.
4. Column name: The first column where you want to input a value; here, select Question 1.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*XPwkmIHRj8WKEM27kH3YQg.png)

Click the "Insert Variable" button in the bottom right corner and select "Response to Question 1...". After inserting, you can add other fields by clicking "Add Column" in the bottom left corner, and continue this for Question 2, Question 3, etc.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*wX7vJDvdneYrid0nECUIeg.png)

For the email of the respondent, you can choose "Person who submitted form."

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*lQqJ0x7CeVK9u7g2R2VktQ.png)

When clicking to insert the variable, select "Email" to automatically fill in the respondent's email.
- Mention (default): tag that User, Raw data is `<@User ID>`
- Name: User name
- Email: User Email

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*CYKDEtnuCKuSgSbAbunB4A.png)

The Timestamp field is a bit tricky; I will provide additional setup methods later. For now, click "Save" to save, then go back to the top right corner of the page and click "Publish" to publish the Shortcut.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*k4rJidYWiVHgco3NYxmA3w.png)

After seeing the successful publication message, you can return to the Slack Channel to try it out.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*XaQ75kM9BnKgcmAEl63fPg.png)

At this point, clicking the lightning bolt will show the Workflow form you just created, which you can click to fill out and play around with.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*W5v-uUjhVTik05TLDwM-uQ.png)

![Left: Computer / Right: Mobile version](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*63CaYi-HlPWRqxExL-GseQ.jpeg)

Left: Computer / Right: Mobile version

We can fill in the information and click "Submit" to test if it works properly.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*xt7JeHRojIWgJCYrw8sKdw.png)

Success! However, we can see that the Timestamp field is empty. Next, we will address this issue.
#### Obtain the submission time from Slack workflow form

Currently, there is no global variable for the current timestamp available in Slack workflow, at least not yet. I only found a [wish post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Slack/comments/l1gzhf/is_there_a_global_timestamp_variable_for_the/){:target="_blank"}.

Initially, I whimsically entered `=NOW()` in the Column Value, but this would make all records' timestamps always reflect the current time, which is completely incorrect.

Using the tricky method provided by a user in that [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Slack/comments/l1gzhf/is_there_a_global_timestamp_variable_for_the/){:target="_blank"}, you can create a clean Timestamp Sheet with one row of data and the column `=NOW()`, then use Update to force the column to reflect the latest time, allowing you to select the current Timestamp.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*54QcEy5QPBt3VXuRSe7-Vw.png)

As shown in the structure above, click [here to view the example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PTk7G7r4P1sGk46sYjomUbfRO9ouPRF0wbmc84ZXA4c/edit?resourcekey#gid=1106265498){:target="_blank"}.
- Row: Similar to the use of ID, set it directly to "1", which will be needed for Select & Update to indicate the data row.
- Timestamp: Set the value to `=NOW()` to always display the current time.
- Value: Used to trigger the update of the Timestamp field; the content can be arbitrary. Here, the email of the person filling it out is included, as long as it triggers the update.

> _You can right-click on the Sheet and select "Hide Sheet" to hide this Sheet, as it is not meant for external use._

Return to the Slack Workflow Builder to edit the workflow form you just created.

Click "Add Step" to add a new step:

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*5lIcdnMQnmglNxaiY8fNUQ.png)

Scroll down to select "Update a spreadsheet row."

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*kRBL8iptGYd2Gsy7Lv6gGA.png)

In "Select a spreadsheet," choose the Sheet you just created, and in "Sheet," select the newly created "Timestamp" Sheet.

In "Choose a column to search," select "Row," and in "Define a cell value to find," enter "1."

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*H8pb9TKvazhqiKKSCKcwCQ.png)

In "Update these columns," select "Value" for "Column name," and for "Value," click "Insert variable" -> "Person who submitted" -> "Select Email."

Click "Save" to finish! The timestamp update in the Sheet has now been triggered, and next, we will read it out.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*avXovKvXz9mlHOq2NWaf3A.png)

Return to the editing page and click "Add Step" again to add a new step. This time select "Select a spreadsheet row" to read the Timestamp.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*xEbDUkWd3utQ9QpllqSNHg.png)

The Search section is the same as "Update a spreadsheet row," then click "Save."

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*VO3lfeTe1bxlL3xN3_wtwQ.png)

After saving, return to the step list page. We can drag the mouse over the steps to change the order.

Change the order to "Update a spreadsheet row" -> "Select a spreadsheet" -> "Add a spreadsheet row."

This means: Update triggers the timestamp update -> Read the Timestamp -> Use it when adding a new Row.

In "Add a spreadsheet row," click "Edit":

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*8IH_AJZn0YHFk5obccmUYg.png)

Scroll to the bottom and click "Add Column" in the lower left corner, then click "Insert a variable" in the lower right corner, find the "Timestamp" variable in the "Select a spreadsheet" section, and inject it.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*-4vk8fjRwkIVSY4Pu-C6VA.png)

After clicking "Save" to store the step, return to the list page and click "Publish Change" in the upper right corner to publish the changes.

Now let's test the workflow shortcut again to see if the timestamp is written correctly.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*GyJ-55XxVEcZ6Cb1Q_H-WQ.png)

Success!
#### Adding a Submission Receipt to Slack Workflow Form

Similar to Google Form submission receipts, Slack workflow forms can also have them.

On the step editing page, we can add another step by clicking "Add Step."

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*16JMg7a_YzUHnnY6JtBrGw.png)



This time, select "Send a message"


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*2CJuPDtuaTM9P5wIKwPspQ.png)


For "Send this message to," choose "Person who submitted form"


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*xKh_l7A-z31B6rQPboFTAA.png)


Enter the message content in order: the title, select "Insert a variable" and choose "Response to question XXX," and you can also insert "Timestamp" at the end. Click "Save" to save the step, then click "Publish Changes"!


> _Additionally, you can use "Send a message" to send the submission results to a specific Channel or DM._ 






![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*gfTjTnaNmu-aPj0MuF6M_Q.png)


Success!

The setup for the Slack workflow form roughly ends here; other functionalities can be freely combined and explored.
### Google Sheet with App Script!

Next, we need to write an App Script to handle the submitted data.


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*04KBQF7e4lCjQm5XeHgVrA.png)


First, select "Tools" -> "Script editor" from the toolbar at the top of Google Sheets.


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*wlg8D_1DHONj__M1dSBCxw.png)


You can click the top left corner to give the project a name.

Now we can start writing the App Script! App Script is designed based on JavaScript, so you can directly use JavaScript code along with Google Sheets' library.
#### Distributing Responses data to each date's Sheet based on submission date


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*T5ExI_5aSf7QY5Zj_gJ3eg.png)

```javascript
function formatData() {
  var bufferSheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName('Responses') // Name of the Sheet storing responses
  
  var rows = bufferSheet.getDataRange().getValues();
  var fileds = [];
  var startDeleteIndex = -1;
  var deleteLength = 0;
  for(index in rows) {
    if (index == 0) {
      fileds = rows[index];
      continue;
    }

    var sheetName = rows[index][0].toLocaleDateString("en-US"); // Convert Date to String using US date format MM/DD/YYYY
    var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName(sheetName); // Get MM/DD/YYYY Sheet
    if (sheet == null) { // If not, create a new one
      sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().insertSheet(sheetName, bufferSheet.getIndex());
      sheet.appendRow(fileds);
    }

    sheet.appendRow(rows[index]); // Add data to the date Sheet
    if (startDeleteIndex == -1) {
      startDeleteIndex = +index + 1;
    }
    deleteLength += 1;
  }

  if (deleteLength > 0) {
    bufferSheet.deleteRows(startDeleteIndex, deleteLength); // After moving to the specified Sheet, remove data from Responses
  }
}
```

Paste the above code in the Code block and press "control" + "s" to save.

Next, we need to add a trigger button in the Sheet ( **it can only be triggered manually; it cannot be automatically triggered when data is written** )


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*XvugOM6drupik0wejbBnnA.png)

1. First, create a new Sheet named "Unfilled List."
2. In the top toolbar, select "Insert" -> "Drawing"

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*BG70QTiE-8QNvlp31jDBMA.png)

Using this interface, draw a button.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*BXXmUWkal7XjluhLcDaSIQ.png)

After "Save and Close," you can adjust and move the button; click the three dots in the upper right corner and select "Assign script."

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*nx2qjDTUKeyorO0W9nOxKA.png)

Enter the function name "formatData."

You can click the added button to test its functionality.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*eZpg-qejhpuPgUY7KDg00Q.png)

If "Authorization Required" appears, click "Continue" to complete the verification.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*hIgRtqKEFs0tsXDxfNTaOg.png)

During the authentication process, you may see "Google hasn’t verified this app." This is normal because the App Script we wrote has not been verified by Google, but that's okay since it's for personal use.

You can click "Advanced" -> "Go to Health Report (Responses) (unsafe)" in the lower left corner.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*QUkmTD1WlEzw7cqW97ll6Q.png)

Click "Allow."

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*0ZPVBwOR2bB4QPsTGX_yCA.png)

> _While the App Script is running, it will display "Running Script." Please do not click again to avoid executing it multiple times._

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*i12l4Q5Y2N9bM9CzTo6XDg.png)

> _You can only execute it again after it shows a successful execution._

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*NbOfqAwIYSUAtJ32hSEOCQ.png)

Success! The filled data is grouped by date.
#### Compare the current date's Sheet with the employee list to generate the data for the unfilled list Sheet.

Let's add a piece of code:
```javascript
// Compare with the employee list Sheet & today's filled Sheet to produce the unfilled list
function generateUnfilledList() {
  var listSheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName('Employee List') // Employee List Sheet name
  var unfilledListSheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName('Unfilled List') // Unfilled List Sheet name
  var today = new Date();
  var todayName = today.toLocaleDateString("en-US");

  var todayListSheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName(todayName) // Get today's MM/DD/YYYY Sheet
  if (todayListSheet == null) {
    SpreadsheetApp.getUi().alert('Cannot find the Sheet for ' + todayName + ' or please execute "Organize Filled Data" first.');
    return;
  }

  var todayEmails = todayListSheet.getDataRange().getValues().map( x => x[1] ) // Get the list of Email Address data from today's Sheet (1 = Column B)
  // index start from 0, so 1 = Column B
  // output: Email Address,zhgchgli@gmail.com,alan@gamil.com,b@gmail.com...
  todayEmails.shift() // Remove the first data, which is the column name "Email Address" and is meaningless
  // output: zhgchgli@gmail.com,alan@gamil.com,b@gmail.com...

  unfilledListSheet.clear() // Clear the unfilled list... preparing to re-enter data
  unfilledListSheet.appendRow([todayName + " Unfilled List"]) // Display the Sheet title in the first row

  var rows = listSheet.getDataRange().getValues(); // Read the employee list Sheet
  for(index in rows) {
    if (index == 0) { // The first row is the header row, save it so that subsequent data generation can also include the header
      unfilledListSheet.appendRow(rows[index]);
      continue;
    }
    
    if (todayEmails.includes(rows[index][3])) { // If this employee's Email is in today's Sheet Email Address, it means they have filled it out, continue to skip... (3 = Column D)
      continue;
    }

    unfilledListSheet.appendRow(rows[index]); // Write a row of data to the unfilled list Sheet
  }
}
```


After saving, follow the previous method of adding code to add a button and assign the script — "generateUnfilledList".

Once completed, you can click to test:


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*LCvfyjnvk3yCaoFnsvVhHg.png)


The unfilled list has been generated successfully! If no content appears, please ensure:
- The employee list has been filled out, or you can enter test data first.
- You must complete the "Organize Filling Data" action first.

#### Read the unfilled list Sheet, compose a message, and send it to the designated Slack Channel

First, we need to add the Incoming WebHooks App to the Slack Channel, which we will use to send messages.


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*AgGLiLsyvenK-LRWI9rlKg.png)

1. Click "Apps" in the lower left corner of Slack -> "Add apps"

Scroll down to set the name and profile picture displayed when sending messages; remember to click "Save Settings" after making changes.

Return to our Google Sheet Script

Add another segment of code:
```javascript
function postSlack() {
  var ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();
  var result = ui.alert(
     'Are you sure you want to send the message?',
     'Send unfilled reminder message to Slack Channel',
      ui.ButtonSet.YES_NO);
  // To avoid accidental clicks, ask for confirmation first

  if (result == ui.Button.YES) {
    var unfilledListSheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName('Unfilled List') // Name of the unfilled list Sheet
    var rows = unfilledListSheet.getDataRange().getValues();
    var persons = [];
    for(index in rows) {
      if (index == 0 || index == 1) { // Skip the title and header rows
        continue;
      }
      
      var person = (rows[index][4] == "") ? (rows[index][2]) : ("<@"+rows[index][4]+">"); // Mark the target; if there is a slack uid, use it first, otherwise just display the nickname; 2 = Column B / 4 = Column E
      if (person == "") { // If none, consider it as abnormal data, ignore
        continue;
      }
      persons.push("• "+person+'\n') // Store the target in the array
    }

    if (persons.length <= 0) { // If there are no targets to be notified, everyone has filled it out, cancel the message sending
      return;
    }

    var preText = "*[Health Report Announcement:loudspeaker:]*\nThe company cares about everyone's health, please remind the following teammates to fill out their health status report daily, thank you:wink:\n\nToday's unfilled health status report list\n\n" // Beginning content of the message...
    var postText = "\n\nFilling out the health status report allows the company to understand the health status of teammates, please ensure everyone fills it out daily>< Thank you all:woman-bowing::skin-tone-2:" // Ending content of the message...
    var payload = {
      "text": preText+persons.join('')+postText,
      "attachments": [{
          "fallback": "Here you can place the Google Form fill link",
          "actions": [
            {
                "name": "form_link",
                "text": "Go to Health Status Report",
                "type": "button",
                "style": "primary",
                "url": "Here you can place the Google Form fill link"
            }
          ],
          "footer": ":rocket:Tip: Click the input box below the ':zap:️lightning' -> 'Shortcut Name' to fill it out directly."
        }
      ]
    };
    var res = UrlFetchApp.fetch('Enter your slack incoming app Webhook URL here',{
      method             : 'post',
      contentType        : 'application/json',
      payload            : JSON.stringify(payload)
    })
  }
}
```


After saving, follow the previous method of adding code to add a button and assign the script — "postSlack".

Once completed, you can click to test:

Success!!! \(The reason ＠U123456 was not successfully tagged is that the ID was randomly generated\)

At this point, the main functionality has been completed!


> **_Note_** 





> _Please note that it is recommended to use the new Slack APP API's [chat\.postMessage](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage){:target="_blank"} to send messages. The simpler method of using Incoming Webhook will be deprecated in the future. I took a shortcut here, but it will need to be adjusted to the new method in conjunction with the next chapter "Import Employee List."_

 




![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*QfgJL_Xb9JhgQnPGjU2CXg.png)

#### Import Employee List

Here, we will need to create a Slack APP.

1. Go to [https://api\.slack\.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps){:target="_blank"}

2. Click "Create New App" in the upper right corner.


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*38It1hdMGq-Lr6hlPIcsWQ.png)


3. Select " **From scratch** "


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*-6FB9vEkju_NszxRrb9LKA.png)


4. Enter the " **App Name** " and the Workspace you want to join.


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*8OPXRdVPW5xHpe1blQDh6w.png)


5. After successful creation, select "OAuth & Permissions" from the left menu for settings.


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*ougV73wzEMnCZ1C3rtx8xg.png)


6. Scroll down to the Scopes section.


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*SprZwCDHq0gtdlN7O2sc-A.png)


Add the following items by clicking "Add an OAuth Scope":
- [**channels:read**](https://api.slack.com/scopes/channels:read){:target="_blank"}
- [**users:read**](https://api.slack.com/scopes/users:read){:target="_blank"}
- [**users:read\.email**](https://api.slack.com/scopes/users:read.email){:target="_blank"}
- If you want to send messages using the APP, you can add [**chat\.postMessage**](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage){:target="_blank"} here.


7. Go back to the top and click "Install to workspace" or "Reinstall to workspace."


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*iCmyMNlLwjhR9qsk-aTfxA.png)



> _\*If Scopes have been added, you need to come back and reinstall this._ 





8. After installation, obtain and copy the `Bot User OAuth Token`.

9. Use the web version of Slack to open the Channel you want to import the list from.


![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*JK0omZIhk1fmP1TOkE2dpg.png)


Get the URL from the browser:
```
https://app.slack.com/client/TXXXX/CXXXX
```

Where `CXXXX` is the Channel ID of this Channel, make a note of this message.

10.

Return to our Google Sheet Script

Add another piece of code:
```javascript
function loadEmployeeList() {
  var formData = {
    'token': 'Bot User OAuth Token',
    'channel': 'Channel ID',
    'limit': 500
  };
  var options = {
    'method' : 'post',
    'payload' : formData
  };
  var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch('https://slack.com/api/conversations.members', options);
  var data = JSON.parse(response.getContentText());
  for (index in data["members"]) {
    var uid = data["members"][index];
    var formData = {
      'token': 'Bot User OAuth Token',
      'user': uid
    };
    var options = {
      'method' : 'post',
      'payload' : formData
    };
    var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch('https://slack.com/api/users.info', options);
    var user = JSON.parse(response.getContentText());

    var email = user["user"]["profile"]["email"];
    var real_name = user["user"]["profile"]["real_name_normalized"];
    var title = user["user"]["profile"]["title"];
    var row = [title, real_name, real_name, email, uid]; // Fill in according to Column

    var listSheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName('Employee List'); // Name of Employee List Sheet
    listSheet.appendRow(row);
  }
}
```


But this time we don't need to add a button, as the import is only required the first time; so just save the file and execute it directly.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*rkw-79xbgd3Nn99fDnLWDQ.png)

First, press "control" + "s" to save, change the dropdown menu above to "loadEmployeeList," and click "Run" to start importing the list into the employee list Sheet.
#### Manually Add New Employee Data

If there are new employees joining later, you can directly add a row in the employee list Sheet and fill in the information. The Slack UID can be directly queried on Slack:

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*7EF6ghe032Pp832_61Ui0w.png)

Click on the person whose UID you want to view, then click "View full profile."

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*uKOp7Xe7AQ4ODKR2t8iDMw.png)

Click "More" and select "Copy member ID," which is the UID. `UXXXXX`
### DONE!

All the above steps have been completed, and you can start automating the tracking of employees' health status.

The completed file is as follows; you can directly create a copy from the following Google Sheet for modification and use:

[![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docs/AHkbwyJ1ypxX3zGwj1swDPSHovOJC_A2eW-sFDKPJO5iRD82y7adF2SKqDluUOOjqnbnezy7RyBFtsGcuKyrUWbPk-NNbMfsPl3rUmfiYLt2F611-cHP_Ig=w1200-h630-p)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PTk7G7r4P1sGk46sYjomUbfRO9ouPRF0wbmc84ZXA4c/edit?resourcekey#gid=922128927){:target="_blank"}

### Supplement
- If you want to send form messages at scheduled dates & times, note that in this case, the form can only be filled out once, so it is not suitable for use here... (at least in the current version, it is still like this), so scheduled reminder messages can still only use plain text + Google Form link.

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*iECjTdwjrRgMswu9MQOMFA.png)

- Currently, there is no way to link to Shortcut to open the Form.
- Google Sheet App Script to prevent duplicate execution:

If you want to prevent accidentally pressing again during execution, causing duplicate execution, you can add the following at the beginning of the function:
```javascript
if (PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().getProperty('FUNCTIONNAME') == 'true') {
  SpreadsheetApp.getUi().alert('Busy... please try again later');
  return;
}
PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().setProperty('FUNCTIONNAME', 'true');
```

At the end of the function execution, add:
```javascript
PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().setProperty('FUNCTIONNAME', 'true');
```

Replace FUNCTIONNAME with the target function name.

Use a global variable to control execution.
### Applications Related to iOS Development

Can be used to integrate CI/CD, wrapping the originally ugly command operations with a GUI, for example, in conjunction with the Slack Bitrise APP, using Slack Workflow form to combine and initiate Build commands:

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*A6Yc9RKCHLEnCLEe591sTw.png)

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*cPJ4JR5wVTZOSmuz635Nyg.png)

After submission, the command will be sent to a private channel with the Bitrise APP, EX:
```bash
bitrise workflow:app_store|branch:develop|ENV[version]:4.32.0
```

![](/assets/d61062833c1a/1*hxyMW4y03udmyW0QXEuAFQ.png)

This will trigger Bitrise to execute the CI/CD Flow.
