### Accommodation

Because the booking time was close to the departure date, after comparing prices and convenience, I chose to stay near Shimbashi Station. (Last time I stayed in Shiodome, but I found Shimbashi more convenient.)

#### [Daiwa Roynet Hotel Shimbashi, Tokyo](https://affiliate.klook.com/redirect?aid=99683&aff_adid=1134759&k_site=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.klook.com%2Fzh-TW%2Fhotels%2Fdetail%2F127656-daiwa-roynet-hotel-shimbashi%2F){:target="_blank"} (4 nights)

- About a 2-minute walk from Shinbashi Station, very close.

- Stay for five days and four nights without changing hotels.

> *Price: NT$ 18,404/4 nights/2 people/standard double room, about NT$ 2,300 per person per night.*

> Ready to go! Let's start!

[**You can complete online check-in and seat selection 24 hours before departure, then go straight to baggage drop-off at the airport to speed up the process.**](https://digital.jal.co.jp/ssci/identification?lang=zh-tw){:target="_blank"}

### Day 1 (09/13 Sat) — Arrive in Tokyo, Shibuya Sky

#### 06:50 Take airport shuttle

#### 07:20 Arrive at Taoyuan Airport Terminal 2

![](/assets/958599363857/1*TkF8qP3e1-iladiHOZgERQ.jpeg)

#### 07:30 Pack and Check-in Luggage

![](/assets/958599363857/1*sNzgznqv8RxRYfwyCaIntg.png)

Assigned to counter at corner number 1, [checked in online in advance](https://digital.jal.co.jp/ssci/identification?lang=zh-tw){:target="_blank"}, went straight to check in luggage, but the people ahead took a long time, so it took about 30 minutes to complete the luggage check-in.

#### ~= 08:20 Complete security check and departure procedures

![](/assets/958599363857/1*lKRxUWP4BGQA1q97X3jJJg.jpeg)

There were quite a few people early in the morning. I finished security and immigration around 8:20 and went to the second floor to have Mos Burger for breakfast. The assigned boarding gate was also the farthest one, D1.

#### Terminal 2 Departure Duty-Free Shop Le Labo

![](/assets/958599363857/1*wyJNusrf7ElLdfZ33YaPWA.jpeg)

Unexpectedly found Le Labo at the Terminal 2 departure duty-free shop. The sales clerk mentioned a current promotion: new members receive a coupon, making the 50ml price NT $5,500, which is cheaper than buying inside Japan (about NT $5,800).

**Latest Price List for 2025 — 50ml:**

- Taiwan Store Price: NT $7,600

- Taiwan Airport Duty-Free Price: NT $5,500 (Promotional Price)

- Tax-refunded price at Japanese stores: approximately NT $5,700

- [**Japan Airport Stores**](https://www.fasola.jp/en/searchByBrand.aspx){:target="_blank"} **Duty-free price: about NT $5,200 🤩 — I bought mine this time only after passing through Narita Airport** T2 **departure.**

![](/assets/958599363857/1*sgPd1BrkZsr2F37f1m1Dlg.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*I6HuL5NdPzQxp3lu43fiUw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*gkCuhDtktYmN6ed170fRZg.jpeg)

While wandering around the airport waiting for boarding, there are two rows of free massage chairs next to D1 The North Face that you can try (just get free tokens from nearby stores to use them).

#### 09:40 Head to the gate to prepare for boarding

![](/assets/958599363857/1*U5QpF19SbJlVAllxZZiQMA.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*izSSFMEAPqbhFtTgt13ndw.jpeg)

The plane I flew this time was a BOEING 737–800, which is a bit old.

> *But I only realized after returning that the plane offered free one-hour onboard WiFi.*

#### 10:06 Departure

![](/assets/958599363857/1*McNWkLo576Z3uJTm9QgYWA.jpeg)

#### JAPAN AIRLINES In-flight Meal

![](/assets/958599363857/1*VoM9bEiz7mMma7fAwp48tw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*tu0L7uohZIqsd9V4JlKGFg.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*s69aVqVz7J7wXFSNi66SsQ.jpeg)

Although the plane is a bit old, the in-flight meal was really good: hamburger meat sauce pasta, a small bowl of cold soba noodles with tofu skin, and lemon pudding for dessert (delicious!).

#### 14:39 Landed at Narita International Airport, Japan (14 minutes delayed)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*0Dvy2jcY6ED8uW6NgmxcXw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*W_bKd7fHb6kBH3uKPqepPg.jpeg)

The floor was a bit damp, and the weather was cloudy, indicating it had rained earlier; upon arrival, the Narita Airport ground game began (it takes about 5 minutes to walk from the plane to immigration).

#### ~= 15:05 Completed immigration and baggage claim, exited the airport

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Xru5o3DBU_GZyTlVW8Wfcw.png)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*oD9JhXDuh47h4aBYxepu7Q.jpeg)

After leaving the airport, take the escalator down to the "Railway" direction and find the "SKYLINER & KEISEI INFORMATION CENTER" counter. Show the QR code of the [Skyliner Keisei Railway ticket](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/7913-keisei-skyliner-narita-airport-express-ticket?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} purchased online to the staff to exchange it for the next train ticket.

> *Note that there are other railway INFORMATION CENTERS at the station, please make sure to identify the INFORMATION CENTER shown in the picture.*

![](/assets/958599363857/1*3rXtVnwanfORgy2DPDrKAA.jpeg)

Missed the 15:16 train, can only take the 15:42 one.

At the station, you can buy [Welcome Suica (must be used within 28 days)](https://www.jreast.co.jp/zh-CHT/multi/welcomesuica/welcomesuica.html){:target="_blank"} and use the regular Suica card top-up machines. You can preload the transportation costs for this trip while waiting for your train. ([But I personally use the Suica on my iPhone because it’s convenient and easy to use!](https://zhgchg.li/posts/z-%E5%BA%A6%E6%97%85%E8%A1%8C%E9%81%8A%E8%A8%98/%E4%BA%AC%E9%98%AA%E7%A5%9E%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E8%A1%8C%E6%94%BB%E7%95%A5-%E4%BA%AC%E9%83%BD%E5%A4%A7%E9%98%AA%E7%A5%9E%E6%88%B68%E6%97%A5%E9%81%8A%E5%85%A8%E7%B4%80%E9%8C%84%E8%88%87%E5%AF%A6%E7%94%A8%E4%BA%A4%E9%80%9A%E4%BD%8F%E5%AE%BF%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97-76d66c2e34af/#-2){:target="_blank"})

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Rx_dIfNqzUwhc21VzUvIkw.png)

Follow the signs for the "Keisei Line" to enter the station, then find the corresponding platform to wait.

#### ~= 15:42 Boarding

![](/assets/958599363857/1*gM-xQihcfGhbEXFv8_uxIg.png)

Many types of trains stop at this platform, so please be sure to check before boarding; staff will also announce along the way. You can show your ticket for confirmation. [**Narita Express requires reserved seats only, no non-reserved seating**](https://www.jreast.co.jp/tc/downloads/pdf/ntrt10_tc.pdf){:target="_blank"}. **Do not board without a ticket.**

![](/assets/958599363857/1*IEQNy3qmUMrm_GaBAFqUTw.jpeg)

The seats on the Narita Express are spacious enough to fit a 28-inch suitcase; if it's tight, you can place it in the front or rear luggage areas of the car, or on the overhead rack (just be careful when handling it).

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Z0UWLv0qvBf77Ue0xfUQ4w.jpeg)

The weather is cloudy.

#### 16:23 Arrived at Keisei Ueno Station

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Z8aKd12JgWIzCE7qtBsgiQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*NEojh1UeOaVynhrnp_d7bQ.jpeg)

After getting off, follow the signs to the underground passage to take the G Ginza Line, heading towards Shibuya, Ueno-Hirokoji to Shimbashi Station.

#### 16:50 Arrive at Tokyo Shimbashi Daiwa ROYNET Hotel

![](/assets/958599363857/1*b1FSV2C8ZsLRq_A_PHnI5Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*09O3hfLEqGKXuUjmv5ALMA.jpeg)

It's just a short walk from Shimbashi Station, very convenient!

The hotel provides a wide range of free amenities, including face masks, bath additives, earplugs, portable mouthwash, and more.

[![Tokyo Shimbashi Daiwa ROYNET Hotel](/assets/958599363857/915d_hqdefault.jpg "Tokyo Shimbashi Daiwa ROYNET Hotel")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKsZna0d38c){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*JXSKiQeoOOtAlQt946SXiw.jpeg)

It's somewhat like the [**trip to Hiroshima and Okayama the year before last**](../31b9b3a63abc/) where I stayed at the "[Rifumax Okayama Kurashiki Ekimae Hotel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmwHRihsyXI){:target="_blank"}." The room was very small, feeling like a single room but with a double bed.

> *The downside, besides being small, is that the room's refrigerator has no freezer function.*

After dropping off our stuff, we set off for Shibuya.

#### 18:30 Queue to Enter Shibuya SKY

On the first floor of Shibuya Scramble Square, find the elevator to go up to the "Shibuya SKY" observation deck. After queuing for the elevator, show your QR code to the ticket staff to queue for entry. (Ticket will be scanned upon entry)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*XTalH3d03U4tmBXD-iK5yw.jpeg)

You can see the Shibuya Crossing from here.

> *After arriving, first use the free lockers to store your belongings. Selfie sticks and similar items are not allowed.*

The third season of "Alice in Borderland" is about to premiere, so I revisited the locations; it feels like there are many more people than before.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*nSlNoHtXjCcmZwLJdhK5Wg.png)

Cross the street and head straight to Shibuya Parco, aiming to eat at [Gokumiya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B11rcg3MLFRgJLqT8){:target="_blank"}.

> [*Tried it once last time, still unforgettable.*](https://zhgchg.li/posts/z-%E5%BA%A6%E6%97%85%E8%A1%8C%E9%81%8A%E8%A8%98/%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E8%A1%8C%E6%94%BB%E7%95%A5-5-%E5%A4%A9%E9%A3%9F%E4%BD%8F%E8%A1%8C%E5%85%A8%E8%A8%98%E9%8C%84%E8%88%87%E5%BF%85%E8%A8%AA%E6%99%AF%E9%BB%9E%E6%8E%A8%E8%96%A6-9da2c51fa4f2/#%E6%B8%8B%E8%B0%B7-parco--%E6%A5%B5%E5%91%B3%E5%B1%8B){:target="_blank"}

#### 20:00 Arrive at Shibuya Parco

![](/assets/958599363857/1*5UmVsCAy5wcJHCK9h8xQvg.png)

Unfortunately, [Gokumiya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B11rcg3MLFRgJLqT8){:target="_blank"} was sold out (will come back in a few days), so I tried another kushikatsu shop in the same food court.

#### 20:15 [Kushikatsu Arata Shibuya Parco](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PTZVZEqdZayWUiap9){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*cbSR83bqt56GgvT8gTYRQw.jpeg)

Ordered several signature fried skewers, double meat fried skewers, a bowl of beef brisket rice, and two drinks, totaling ¥6,340 JPY.

> *The light, Japanese-style fried skewers are delicious and not greasy, and the braised beef rice is flavorful and satisfying.*

> ***Note that the fried skewer shop charges an extra basic fee for cabbage (お通し)*** *, I actually forgot the exact amount, but it should be around* ¥ *300 per person.*

The same pancake ham, cheese, and egg burger!

> *I visited this McDonald's [last time as well](../9da2c51fa4f2/). The drawbacks are that it's old, not very clean, and lacks self-order kiosks.*

![](/assets/958599363857/1*pxQYLZnHM7-UA6B7RisQnw.jpeg)

After exiting from the station office at the far side, I first picked up a tourist brochure and decided to take the bus to the farthest [Hikawa Shrine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3vVRnikJQL3zYuGi6){:target="_blank"}, then walk back while sightseeing.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*h0c9y56GEfHWTrtP7q8kOQ.png)

Exit directly from the second-floor overpass and go downstairs to the bus boarding area.

#### 11:35 Waiting for the bus at Kawagoe Bus Station

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Z92lcpTR1OitKAL3LRVrtw.png)

Both Platform 1 and Platform 3 have many trains going to Hikawa Shrine. In the end, I took the Me 01 from Platform 3.

If you don't have enough change, you can exchange money with the shrine staff. Volunteers nearby can help translate the fortune into English for free. If you get a bad fortune, just tie it to the shrine to ward off misfortune.

#### 12:45 Leave Hikawa Shrine

After taking some photos and walking around, I left Hikawa Shrine at about 12:45, ready to take a bus to Koedo Street and 吉伊卡哇 MOGUMOGU 本舗 Kawagoe store.

#### Seibu — Little Edo Loop Bus

![](/assets/958599363857/1*lbJXQmrjFElNnSoh_Rtc2g.jpeg)

While waiting for the train, I saw a cool sightseeing bus with music — it was the [Seibu Transportation Koedo Loop Bus](https://eaglebus.group/co-edo/zh/){:target="_blank"}; **Tobu passes cannot be used**. You can pay with a transit card or buy the " [Loop Pass](https://eaglebus.group/co-edo/2025/06/18/ryde0624/){:target="_blank"}" issued by Seibu Railway.

After shopping, it was nearly 14:00, and I was really hungry and tired.

After returning to Ikebukuro, first explore the department stores at Ikebukuro Station. There are Parco and Tobu Department Store, with many things to browse.

#### [THE GUEST cafe & diner Ikebukuro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tGxXYhytPWoMXzY6A){:target="_blank"} , [Chikawa Ramen Pork](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Xjj1pvnPpyyvUGH48){:target="_blank"}

**There is also a [Gokumiya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vkmPHf4j6SgRGprb8){:target="_blank"} at Tokyo Station**, but it gets very crowded. It opens at 11:00, and many people are already lining up by then. It looks like the wait time is about an hour.

Turn around and go eat Kobe beef across the street.

Just like the taste I remembered, the meat is tender with no off-flavors, only the natural aroma of beef; before I knew it, it was all gone!

#### 12:20 Start exploring Tokyo Station Underground First Avenue

Did not get a [numbered ticket](https://chiikawa-info.jp/chiikawaland/tokyo/){:target="_blank"}, so could only pass by and take photos. The stock looked plentiful, and there were few people (feels like they controlled the crowd too little?).

![](/assets/958599363857/1*RhUU4XWAV_mo818lqez6qw.png)

If you haven't had enough shopping, you can also visit the adjacent Daimaru Department Store or continue to explore other nearby underground shopping streets.

#### 14:00 Tokyo Station Tax Refund and Luggage Storage

For tax refunds on purchases at Tokyo Station, you can go directly back to the first floor and find the tax refund counter opposite the Tokaido Sanyo Shinkansen Nihombashi Entrance.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Y0o7PYsSkdhHB0F-pdG6jQ.jpeg)

Bought some things. Since the locker counter closes at 8:00 PM, I looked for coin lockers to store my items. There are many lockers available here as well.

> *After storing my luggage, I went to the food court to buy some snacks to eat on the way.*

For e-tickets purchased in advance on [KKday](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/transportation/japan-rail?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} / [Klook](https://affiliate.klook.com/redirect?aid=99683&aff_adid=1134759&k_site=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.klook.com%2Fzh-TW%2Fjapan-rail%2F){:target="_blank"}, there is no need to exchange tickets. Just scan the QR code on your phone directly at the blue gate sensor to enter.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*8XhMmWSYamkoIpZcrcexiw.jpeg)

When entering the station successfully, a ticket will be issued (for easy reference or ticket inspection on the train), but entering and exiting still requires using the mobile QR code.

Welcome to the 2025 Atami Sea Fireworks Festival!

> *Official reminder: The fireworks festival ends with large crowds, please purchase Shinkansen tickets in advance.*

After exiting the Shinkansen, you need to pass through the local train ticket gate (just show the staff your ticket QR code to exit).

The weather was cloudy, but the advantage was that it wasn't too sunny!

![](/assets/958599363857/1*NoN8BV-7HvjIqgoMvrNo_Q.jpeg)

Walk straight through the shopping street and keep going down to reach the beach.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*xsPseN91hTY7i51fJPjcTA.png)

[Route as shown in the above map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xZ6QHf3UAWu4iXtD8){:target="_blank"}, first walk to Lawson to buy some food and drinks, then head to the beach for a picnic and wait for the fireworks.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*x0YEr4v70zdBu1cMZyq7zw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*OSrew6n7pXgiQMkmz6TFrw.png)

The fireworks are launched roughly at the location shown above. You can walk to [Higashikaigancho](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XZmFfi3wDBJFERyQ8){:target="_blank"} and wait on the beach towards the back. This beach area allows you to play in the water, and there are shared restrooms and showers nearby for changing (but it's recommended to check in advance, as some facilities seem worn out).

![](/assets/958599363857/1*93jLDQa0cb1jewFvsazD9Q.jpeg)

You can also see Atami Castle from Atami Beach in the distance.

#### 17:00 Atami Sunshine Beach

![](/assets/958599363857/1*MaQ6luHYefGS_EdREO8Z8A.jpeg)

It doesn't feel necessary to arrive in Atami so early; the crowd is not as large as expected. Before around 18:30, there are still spots on the beach, and even by the 20:20 fireworks display, there are still places available to watch.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*7TaD649tgt3KS0hfcDNuzg.jpeg)

#### 18:00 Atami Fireworks Festival Beach Crowd

![](/assets/958599363857/1*_FH0OfAii22pyLOikGi2Tg.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*ET9HOKp_AUG6BXKz9YFRfQ.jpeg)

You can see that at 18:00 there are still many seats available, or many people come early to lay down picnic mats to reserve spots and then walk around nearby, returning just before the fireworks start.

**A little further ahead [around the Sky Deck area](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fYK3FxCFxZ8oMzRj6){:target="_blank"}, there is a small night market selling food (though the cost-performance is not great):**

![](/assets/958599363857/1*ABMNXDPrn2rHZ_BT_q6piA.png)

There are restrooms around the beach, so you don't have to worry about not finding one.

#### 20:15 Crowd at the beach near the fireworks release time

![](/assets/958599363857/1*GltFsKbSIEPBGCU0tujfHQ.jpeg)

There are many people on the trail behind.

#### 20:20 Fireworks Festival Begins

![](/assets/958599363857/1*qsOMKdPSeRp3svZjdxg0bw.png)

The fireworks had several parts, lasting until 20:40 (20 minutes). My favorite part was the magnificent full-screen fireworks. Unfortunately, the humidity was high today, so the smoke lingered and didn’t disperse well towards the end.

#### 20:45 Start leaving the venue

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Is19CY4ydHSl6o_koAwUxw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*-Op_qDpZVTPamDHpMjrLGA.jpeg)

There were many people leaving, but everyone moved toward the station in an orderly manner; it was downhill coming in and uphill going back (tiring).

#### 21:05 Return to Atami Station

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*0YVBx1LVIM38oZnnFl-uHw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*AAk3JHAyjLZtD47VozQxhQ.png)

Returning with many people takes about 20–25 minutes to walk back to Atami Station, and the number of people entering the station is also very large; if you take the local train, you need to queue slowly to enter the station. **If you have already purchased a Shinkansen ticket, you can directly use the manned gate on the right to pass through and then go to the Shinkansen platform from the local line.**

> *Originally worried about tight timing, I bought a 22:02 train ticket from Atami to Tokyo; judging by the situation on site, the earlier 21:26 train would have been more than enough.*

#### 21:20 Arrive at the station and wait for the train

![](/assets/958599363857/1*FlXrgL64tIESh9YANzlCgA.png)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*P8UbBT810VfOu1d-FjmGfQ.jpeg)

The Shinkansen here is very spacious, and the air conditioning is very cool.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Xh7kHOo5wLCsZq0HsfcxjA.png)

Bought a can of apple soda to keep going, but heavy rain in other areas caused all trains to be delayed.

#### ~=22:25 Boarded (delayed nearly 20 minutes)

What a fulfilling day!

### Day 4 (09/16 Tue) — Azabudai TeamLab, Harajuku Shopping, Otter Cafe

After a good sleep, take the bus out.

#### 10:10 Arrive at [Azabudai Hills Forest](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PbjLmES23cBRVRwK6){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Vxi-ROH7326xUK1Q_RaSSA.jpeg)

I thought Azabudai Hills only had [JP Tower](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yyYwwHoZbHBmysqN6){:target="_blank"}, but it turns out it's a whole cluster of fragmented buildings with many department store counters and food options.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*l04M339xYWoaX0St4PmTGA.jpeg)

First, go to a café for breakfast and to wake up.

#### 10:50 [Head to teamLab Borderless: MORI Building DIGITAL ART MUSEUM (Azabudai Hills Garden Plaza B, B1)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a1VeYdbgBhvPCPXC7){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*G2WDXXLUhC1r2oueJDxDcQ.jpeg)

There is no map inside; if you want to explore everything, you can first get the official guidebook outside.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*GKfgsOIo0qXpIshU_0N3UA.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*6BC5_ZTb1w6zcBWf5mNeng.png)

Turn right for a free luggage storage area. After storing your items, show your ticket to the staff to enter.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*kTlH8oGRnbrMmf3L_nWSrg.jpeg)

teamLab is truly amazing, featuring various magical and creative scenes that feel unreal. The interactions include light and shadow, mirrors, spheres, pillars, leaves, mist, and more. Almost all are 360-degree full environments, offering a highly immersive experience.

> *No maps are provided; visitors need to explore all exhibition rooms independently. For women wearing skirts concerned about exposure, aprons are kindly provided at the entrance.*

> *Before entering each room, staff usually provide instructions, mostly asking visitors not to touch anything and to walk carefully.*

> *There are restrooms inside, but you need to find the signs yourself or ask the staff.*

![](/assets/958599363857/1*rOQik1WqrSYIlOlNE8GCNg.jpeg)

The photos also look very magical.

To have seen something is to not have seen something else

> *We left around 12:15, but I can't guarantee everything was fully explored; if we weren't hungry, spending two to three hours inside wouldn't be a problem.*

![](/assets/958599363857/1*H3hzyw1S7R8QJqGClj7-Kg.jpeg)

After visiting teamLab, there is a HARBS right outside. Let's start with a fruit mille crepe cake to fill the stomach.

Signature Fruit Mille Crepes Cake (Mille Crepes/ミルクレープ) 1 slice ￥1,050 + minimum one drink purchase.

> *Contains cantaloupe (very sweet and delicious) + banana + kiwi.*

#### 13:20 Tokyo Tower

[Visited last time and went up **(please refer to the previous travelogue)**](https://zhgchg.li/posts/z-%E5%BA%A6%E6%97%85%E8%A1%8C%E9%81%8A%E8%A8%98/%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E8%A1%8C%E6%94%BB%E7%95%A5-5-%E5%A4%A9%E9%A3%9F%E4%BD%8F%E8%A1%8C%E5%85%A8%E8%A8%98%E9%8C%84%E8%88%87%E5%BF%85%E8%A8%AA%E6%99%AF%E9%BB%9E%E6%8E%A8%E8%96%A6-9da2c51fa4f2/#%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC%E9%90%B5%E5%A1%94){:target="_blank"}, this time just passed by to take photos.

Take the train to Harajuku.

#### 14:00 Harajuku

![](/assets/958599363857/1*6SJEx_1Xe1cRtxNtxCACUw.jpeg)

As soon as I came out, I saw Giikawa again and again. Upstairs at [Tokyu Plaza Omotesando Harajuku](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qo9uS7tVHoRda1MQ7){:target="_blank"} there is a [Giikawa Bakery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7rPeXTvCVEtWonMd7){:target="_blank"}.

The bread and jam shop on the left requires a numbered ticket for entry; the souvenir doll shop on the right does not.

(Because I just happened to pass by, I didn’t go in.)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*BAveEbCyszfKzZc3L7CE9w.jpeg)

The nearby shops had plenty of stock, but since I already had sweet potatoes, I just looked around without buying anything.

#### [Kiddy Land キデイランド 原宿店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JBGBKiEBNdcycYPz8){:target="_blank"}

Afterwards, I went to another nearby Kiddy Land to browse. ([But this one doesn't have KiiKawa](https://www.kiddyland.co.jp/harajuku/){:target="_blank"})

![](/assets/958599363857/1*WTTkpsTLZ9_35_KVXD01wQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*KG4Y3IlpSLIcD-SOBxb4Ug.jpeg)

There are many IPs like Snoopy, Sanrio, Pokémon, Rilakkuma, and more.

By the time I finished browsing, it was almost 3:00 PM. I had only eaten a slice of fruit mille-feuille for lunch and felt a bit hungry, so I randomly picked a highly rated American burger joint I passed by to eat.

#### [14:50 The Great Burger](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xgoLanLfSSYFC5jP9){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*CxJhjOkE7NSkV2wwiZWlWA.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*0wzaWAsar2xUmujgMfHVUg.jpeg)

The specialty is wagyu mini burgers.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Anb4bgPGloM3oNkV6btS-g.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*2x_JAyGUZmJ58CSR30Rr7A.jpeg)

The taste is pretty good, but eating too much can be overwhelming.

#### 15:40 Shopping in Harajuku

After eating, continue strolling around Harajuku until evening (16:30) to go to the reserved Otter Café.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*sWQbbQUfLq3EWzMhJrvTng.jpeg)

Just wandering around and ended up at the same Le Labo perfume shop as last time. In Japan 2025, the price for 50ml perfume is ¥31,350, and after tax refund, it's about ¥28,500.

#### 16:30 [HARRY HARAJUKU terrace Otter Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WHyJ88K5hRVc4vnk9){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*b20FSUf7uuIrFFNRLP6vwQ.jpeg)

Go to the top floor of this building, then take the stairs on the side up.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*eoDe1nHReBDY4bv070eEBQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*x3phhvrHJ3ocidaw3glJLw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*CpEDCXiZ8Js_st4tzrXtGA.jpeg)

The venue is small, with three pools outside where three otters roam around. You can buy snacks to feed them (¥880). (They will reach out their paws)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*U30ypE-233jdjvcR0aejGA.jpeg)

The coffee is from the vending machine, self-served. (Buy 30 minutes and get 1 cup free)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*fBpOYC967t_nalgHfuGCEg.png)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*3dL7ITdswBmvR6KUU9MQSw.jpeg)

The venue itself is not very large. In the middle is a paid interactive otter area (additional fee required), next to it is a paid Totoro interactive area (additional fee required), and on the other side is a free hedgehog interactive area, along with a few otters inside a fenced enclosure.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*L1tbx1lOqgPbpgBmEhGkVA.jpeg)

We added ¥880 per person for a 5-minute close interaction with the otters; otherwise, you can't actually touch them.

#### 17:20 [Petting Otters](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WHyJ88K5hRVc4vnk9){:target="_blank"}

> *There were quite a few visitors interacting with the otters; we only got our turn at 17:20. The staff kept track of the time.*

You can gently pet him while he's eating and flipping his belly; his fur is very soft.

> ***Overall: The rating might only be around 2.5–3 stars***

> *The overall venue is quite small. The basic fee is ¥3,080 per person for one hour. Aside from the hedgehogs, there is no interaction with other animals, and the coffee is just from a vending machine. Although the staff are gentle with the animals, the other otters resting nearby or in the outdoor pool have limited space to move, which feels a bit sad.*

> *It seems larger than a typical coffee shop and there are otters running around.*

#### 18:00 Head to Shibuya

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Do_SdWdOCG8ZhXXDVcyEtg.jpeg)

#### 18:20 Queue at [Gokumiya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oZR5RprBErWbkAjq8){:target="_blank"}

It's still early, so I came to Shibuya again and started with a meal at Gokumiya.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*bA7IPZZUq2LVdCbFs9H5lw.png)

At this time, there weren't many people, so I only had to wait a little before getting served.

I ate too many hamburger steaks at lunch and felt a bit overwhelmed. I ordered the pure beef steak set on the left, and the juice was delicious.

> [*Last time I had the hamburger steak + beef steak set*](https://zhgchg.li/posts/z-%E5%BA%A6%E6%97%85%E8%A1%8C%E9%81%8A%E8%A8%98/%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E8%A1%8C%E6%94%BB%E7%95%A5-5-%E5%A4%A9%E9%A3%9F%E4%BD%8F%E8%A1%8C%E5%85%A8%E8%A8%98%E9%8C%84%E8%88%87%E5%BF%85%E8%A8%AA%E6%99%AF%E9%BB%9E%E6%8E%A8%E8%96%A6-9da2c51fa4f2/#%E6%B8%8B%E8%B0%B7-parco--%E6%A5%B5%E5%91%B3%E5%B1%8B){:target="*blank"} _Just remember to bring two pairs of chopsticks: metal ones for grilling and wooden ones for eating._**

#### Shopping and Buying Cosmetics

![](/assets/958599363857/1*mOCaZv_M3wUL_shhpsklRw.jpeg)

At the department store, I found some fragrances and bought two bottles along with a pillow spray to try at home.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*hHziMmw8-TXZgTU96AaLAQ.jpeg)

After eating, I strolled around Shibuya a bit more, then went back to the hotel to pick up some money and buy cosmetics at a drugstore. Returned to the hotel to rest, getting ready to say goodbye to Tokyo.

Didn’t explore much, worried about not finding a place to store luggage, so I used the locker counter inside the station.

> *Later found it quite not cost-effective, because you have to pick up items and pay to enter the station, plus it's expensive; the main point is that it's out of the way.*

> ***Later I learned that the Skyliner Keisei Ueno is at Ueno Station Yamashita Exit or Shinobazu Exit*** *You can access it inside the station without going outside in the sun (but it’s easy to get lost inside the station); to use the lockers here, you need to walk back (about 15 minutes), and there are many coin lockers there as well.*

Exit here and you will be at Ueno Zoo. Turn left, **prepare to reserve a seat for the Skyliner Keisei Ueno.**

Finally saw the Skyliner Keisei Ueno Station.

> *Since all Skyliner seats are reserved, it is recommended to book your seat in advance for safety.*

> *The station staff can speak Chinese (I just didn't realize they were speaking Chinese at first).*

Stroll around Ueno at the last moment.

There is also a second store next door.

The general location is shown in the image above.

There is a gacha capsule toy area to explore on the second floor.

Got a [Shinkansen ticket capsule toy](https://www.so-ta.com/products_detail/capsuletoy/tokaido_shinkansen/){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*rysyBldMgjEOuR__7hQuOg.jpeg)

I also got hooked and bought a ReFa heart-shaped massage brush at Loft.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*sGjazwQmnuqRKWbTubIZXA.png)

Ate a croissant here to fill up.

#### 13:20 Return to Ueno Station

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Ht4JmIU70nKQWu560yEM2A.jpeg)

Stop by to buy Sugar Butter Tree as a souvenir.

Finally, I returned to the Park Exit to pick up my luggage, took a long walk, and then went back to Keisei Ueno.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*maLcXgZQHSKZdJB2CQngZg.jpeg)

The route is a bit strange; you need to go down to the platform first, then exit from another exit to reach Shinobazu-guchi.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*XLFR3n_fxsGWBK6sU5Lkhw.jpeg)

This underground passage has many coin-operated lockers, and they are mostly empty.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*TyOvYS_0FCfSujRBojgRvg.jpeg)

I couldn’t help but say that crossing the road leads directly to the Skyliner Keisei Ueno station. (Not sure if there’s a closer exit; I didn’t wander around to avoid getting lost.)

#### 14:10 Return to Skyliner Keisei Ueno, prepare to take the train to Narita Airport

![](/assets/958599363857/1*j-oOGCBRflbJWVfkQLrA_Q.png)

#### 14:20 Depart for Narita Airport

![](/assets/958599363857/1*-bEzz-shmaBClAhFkmjf8A.jpeg)

Just stopped by a convenience store on the street to buy some food and drinks to recharge.

#### 15:03 Arrive at Narita Airport Terminal 2

![](/assets/958599363857/1*lpge7uQIA81oEOD9JjK3pQ.jpeg)

Once you go straight up, you'll reach the international departure area.

> *I originally planned to eat at [the newly opened Shake Shack burger at Terminal 1](https://matcha-jp.com/tw/25632){:target="_blank"}, but I was too tired to go.*

#### 15:40 Completed check-in

![](/assets/958599363857/1*qtNeXNg2HuWhOQBd0YqnyQ.png)

> [*You can complete online check-in and seat selection 24 hours before departure, then go straight to baggage drop-off at the airport to speed up the process.*](https://digital.jal.co.jp/ssci/identification?lang=zh-tw){:target="_blank"}

After checking in my luggage, I went straight to line up for departure (tired).

#### 16:00 Complete security check and departure procedures

![](/assets/958599363857/1*XksioltS7RRgmtf4Gz-N3A.jpeg)

Walk towards the direction of decreasing numbers to reach the central connecting hall, where you can find food and shopping.

#### First, go to JAPAN FOOD HALL B1 to grab something to eat

![](/assets/958599363857/1*xj-6KVdDgwx_GPgGF0bHqQ.jpeg)

#### 16:25 Snack Time

![](/assets/958599363857/1*bgttA6-L8uW93zM7TpwOmw.jpeg)

> *Ordered a tempura shrimp soba with a draft beer.*

> *Actual cost: 955 TWD (Airport prices are just expensive…)*

#### 16:50 Shopping at Duty-Free and Souvenir Shops

![](/assets/958599363857/1*39UCCUtGuFBVV1FEBQG-9A.png)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*UrCaiyBHekSvy0tzTbM5Gw.png)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*DubJNBeqI-tWI5amx_VbbQ.jpeg)

Narita Airport duty-free shops really have everything. Besides luxury goods, skincare products, and tobacco and alcohol, there are also well-stocked souvenir stores with all kinds of items. Prices are similar to or even cheaper than outside. If you haven’t bought enough, you can take advantage of last-minute shopping before boarding.

#### 17:05 Le Labo

![](/assets/958599363857/1*J2hChay4G6BPHCItaueHFA.jpeg)

Actually, without specifically looking for it, I unexpectedly found La Lebo at Narita Airport in [Fa-So-La DUTY FREE Cosmetics & Perfumery](https://www.fasola.jp/en/searchByBrand.aspx){:target="_blank"}. According to the official website, both Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 have it.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*9XCr-56Q5AlUCDRedP1cBA.jpeg)

> *Even more surprising is the price: **50ml — ¥25,700**, which is cheaper than the tax-free price of ¥28,500 within Japan.*

![](/assets/958599363857/1*ar416ZWoAliERsR_Fg1GJQ.jpeg)

Finally, I impulsively bought a 26–30ml bottle (airport exclusive size), actually spending 3,720 TWD.

#### 17:30 Head to the boarding gate and wait for the flight

![](/assets/958599363857/1*5PiE4fENJsi1dynUUL08OQ.jpeg)

Gate 67B is in a very corner and far away; unfortunately, I didn't see any vending machines selling peach water along the way.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*K8V9RnmpGnx--VJ8HTZOaw.png)

#### 17:50 Boarding, goodbye Tokyo!

![](/assets/958599363857/1*OxCGLuV_XrFB_c-BHM10gA.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*0qZy2nb8aXRxB1fmR-uCUA.jpeg)

The aircraft model is BOEING 737–800, the same as on the way here.

#### Narita Airport was extremely crowded. The flight was originally scheduled to depart at 18:10 but we queued until nearly 19:00 before takeoff.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*LbcG5trqHcp_4GejuI6iDg.jpeg)

#### Japan Airlines Free In-flight WiFi

![](/assets/958599363857/1*1sP5H5jRMsQxm02W2TG6QA.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*eZ9beWgHlSQufFt-2Mnegg.jpeg)

I accidentally discovered that the plane offers one hour of free WiFi.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*5CozWE6P0BhIjE6vksu9cQ.jpeg)

The airplane meal was also excellent, featuring curry pork cutlet rice and Häagen-Dazs dessert.

#### 21:07 Return to Taiwan
