### Accommodation

Because the booking time was close to the departure date, after comparing prices and convenience, I chose to stay near Shimbashi Station. (Last time I stayed in Shiodome, but Shimbashi felt more convenient.)

#### [Daiwa Roynet Hotel Shimbashi, Tokyo](https://affiliate.klook.com/redirect?aid=99683&aff_adid=1134759&k_site=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.klook.com%2Fzh-TW%2Fhotels%2Fdetail%2F127656-daiwa-roynet-hotel-shimbashi%2F){:target="_blank"} (4 nights)

### Day 1 (09/13 Sat) — Arrival in Tokyo, Shibuya Sky

#### 06:50 Take airport shuttle

#### 07:20 Arrive at Taoyuan Airport Terminal 2

![](/assets/958599363857/1*TkF8qP3e1-iladiHOZgERQ.jpeg)

#### 07:30 Pack and Check Luggage

![](/assets/958599363857/1*sNzgznqv8RxRYfwyCaIntg.png)

Assigned to counter number 1 at the far corner, [checked in online in advance](https://digital.jal.co.jp/ssci/identification?lang=zh-tw){:target="_blank"} and went straight to check in luggage. However, the people ahead were delayed for a long time, so it took about 30 minutes to complete the luggage check-in.

#### ~= 08:20 Complete security check and immigration clearance

![](/assets/958599363857/1*lKRxUWP4BGQA1q97X3jJJg.jpeg)

There were quite a few people early in the morning. I finished security and immigration around 8:20 and went to the second floor to have Mos Burger for breakfast. The assigned boarding gate was also the farthest one, D1.

#### Terminal 2 Departure Duty-Free Shop Le Labo

![](/assets/958599363857/1*wyJNusrf7ElLdfZ33YaPWA.jpeg)

Unexpectedly found Le Labo at the Terminal 2 departure duty-free shop. The sales assistant mentioned a current promotion where new members get a coupon, making the 50ml price NT $5,500, cheaper than buying in Japan (about NT $5,800).

**Latest 2025 Price List — 50ml:**

- Taiwan Store Price: NT $7,600

- Taiwan Airport Store Duty-Free Price: NT $5,500 (Promotional Price)

- Tax-refunded price at Japanese stores: about NT $5,700

- [**Japan Airport Stores**](https://www.fasola.jp/en/searchByBrand.aspx){:target="_blank"} **Duty-free price: about NT $5,200 🤩 — I bought mine at the very end after leaving Narita Airport** Terminal 2 **departure.**

![](/assets/958599363857/1*I6HuL5NdPzQxp3lu43fiUw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*gkCuhDtktYmN6ed170fRZg.jpeg)

While wandering around the airport waiting for boarding, there are two rows of free massage chairs next to D1 The North Face available for use (you can get free tokens from nearby stores).

#### 09:40 Head to the boarding gate to prepare for boarding

![](/assets/958599363857/1*U5QpF19SbJlVAllxZZiQMA.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*izSSFMEAPqbhFtTgt13ndw.jpeg)

The plane we took this time was a BOEING 737–800, which is a bit outdated.

> *But I only found out after returning that the flight offered one hour of free onboard WiFi.*

#### 10:06 Departure

![](/assets/958599363857/1*McNWkLo576Z3uJTm9QgYWA.jpeg)

#### JAPAN AIRLINES In-flight Meal

![](/assets/958599363857/1*VoM9bEiz7mMma7fAwp48tw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*tu0L7uohZIqsd9V4JlKGFg.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*s69aVqVz7J7wXFSNi66SsQ.jpeg)

Although the plane is a bit old, the in-flight meal is really good: hamburger meat sauce pasta, a small bowl of cold soba with tofu skin, and lemon pudding dessert (delicious!).

#### 14:39 Landed at Narita International Airport, Japan (14 minutes delayed)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*0Dvy2jcY6ED8uW6NgmxcXw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*W_bKd7fHb6kBH3uKPqepPg.jpeg)

The floor is a bit damp, and the weather is cloudy. It seems it rained heavily earlier. After arrival, we started the Narita Airport ground game (it takes about 5 minutes to walk from the plane to immigration).

#### ~= 15:05 Complete immigration procedures + collect luggage and exit the airport

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Xru5o3DBU_GZyTlVW8Wfcw.png)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*oD9JhXDuh47h4aBYxepu7Q.jpeg)

After exiting the airport, take the escalator down towards the "Railway" direction. Find the "SKYLINER & KEISEI INFORMATION CENTER" counter and show the pre-purchased [Skyliner Keisei Railway ticket](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/7913-keisei-skyliner-narita-airport-express-ticket?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} QR code to the staff to exchange it for the next available train ticket.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*3rXtVnwanfORgy2DPDrKAA.jpeg)

Missed the 15:16 train, can only take the 15:42 one.

There are [Welcome Suica cards (must be used within 28 days)](https://www.jreast.co.jp/zh-CHT/multi/welcomesuica/welcomesuica.html){:target="_blank"} and regular Suica card top-up machines at the station. You can reload the transportation costs for this trip while waiting for your train. ([But I personally find using Suica on my iPhone very convenient and easy!](https://zhgchg.li/posts/z-%E5%BA%A6%E6%97%85%E8%A1%8C%E9%81%8A%E8%A8%98/%E4%BA%AC%E9%98%AA%E7%A5%9E%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E8%A1%8C%E6%94%BB%E7%95%A5-%E4%BA%AC%E9%83%BD%E5%A4%A7%E9%98%AA%E7%A5%9E%E6%88%B68%E6%97%A5%E9%81%8A%E5%85%A8%E7%B4%80%E9%8C%84%E8%88%87%E5%AF%A6%E7%94%A8%E4%BA%A4%E9%80%9A%E4%BD%8F%E5%AE%BF%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97-76d66c2e34af/#-2){:target="_blank"})

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Rx_dIfNqzUwhc21VzUvIkw.png)

Follow the signs for the "Keisei Line" to enter the station, then find the corresponding platform to wait.

#### ~= 15:42 Board the train

![](/assets/958599363857/1*gM-xQihcfGhbEXFv8_uxIg.png)

This platform serves many types of trains, so please make sure to confirm before boarding; staff will also make announcements along the way, and you can show them your ticket for verification. [**Narita Express requires reserved seats for all cars, no non-reserved seats available**](https://www.jreast.co.jp/tc/downloads/pdf/ntrt10_tc.pdf){:target="_blank"} **, do not board without a ticket**.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*IEQNy3qmUMrm_GaBAFqUTw.jpeg)

The seats on the Narita Express are spacious enough to fit a 28-inch suitcase; if it feels tight, you can place your luggage in the front or rear area of the car, or on the overhead rack (just be careful when handling it).

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Z0UWLv0qvBf77Ue0xfUQ4w.jpeg)

The weather is cloudy.

#### 16:23 Arrive at Keisei Ueno Station

![](/assets/958599363857/1*NEojh1UeOaVynhrnp_d7bQ.jpeg)

After getting off, follow the signs to the underground passage to take the Ginza Line at G station, heading towards Shibuya, then get off at Shimbashi station via Ueno-hirokoji.

#### 16:50 Arrive at Tokyo Shimbashi Daiwa Roynet Hotel

![](/assets/958599363857/1*b1FSV2C8ZsLRq_A_PHnI5Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*09O3hfLEqGKXuUjmv5ALMA.jpeg)

It's just a short walk from Shimbashi Station, very convenient!

The hotel provides a wide range of complimentary amenities, including face masks, bath additives, earplugs, and portable mouthwash, among others.

[![Tokyo Shimbashi Daiwa Roynet Hotel](/assets/958599363857/915d_hqdefault.jpg "Tokyo Shimbashi Daiwa Roynet Hotel")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKsZna0d38c){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*JXSKiQeoOOtAlQt946SXiw.jpeg)

It's somewhat like the [**trip to Hiroshima and Okayama two years ago**](../31b9b3a63abc/), staying at the "[Rifumax Okayama Kurashiki Ekimae Hotel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmwHRihsyXI){:target="_blank"}." The room was very small, feeling like a single room with just a double bed.

> *The downside, besides being small, is that the room fridge has no freezer function.*

After dropping off our stuff, we headed to Shibuya.

#### 18:30 Queue to enter Shibuya SKY

At the first floor of Shibuya Scramble Square, find the elevator to go up to the "Shibuya SKY" observation deck. After lining up and taking the elevator, show your QR code to the ticket inspector to queue for entry. (Ticket will be scanned upon entry)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*XTalH3d03U4tmBXD-iK5yw.jpeg)

You can see the Shibuya Crossing from here.

> *After arriving, first use the free lockers to store your belongings. Selfie sticks and similar items are prohibited.*

The third season of "Alice in Borderland" is about to premiere, so let's revisit the scenes; it feels like there are many more people than before.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*nSlNoHtXjCcmZwLJdhK5Wg.png)

Cross the street and head straight to Shibuya Parco, intending to eat at [極味屋](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B11rcg3MLFRgJLqT8){:target="_blank"}.

Unfortunately, [極味屋](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B11rcg3MLFRgJLqT8){:target="_blank"} was sold out (will come back to eat in a few days), so we tried another kushikatsu restaurant in the same food court.

Ordered several signature fried skewers, double meat skewers, a bowl of beef brisket rice, and two drinks, totaling ¥6,340 JPY.

> *The lightly battered Japanese-style fried skewers are delicious and not greasy, and the beef brisket rice is flavorful and filling.*

> ***Note that the fried skewer shop charges an extra basic fee for cabbage (お通し)*** *, I actually forgot the exact amount, but it should be around* ¥ *300 per person.*

The same waffle ham, cheese, and egg burger!

> *I visited this McDonald's [last time as well](../9da2c51fa4f2/). The drawbacks are that it is old, not very clean, and lacks self-order kiosks.*

After exiting from the station office on the far side, I first picked up a tourist brochure and decided to take the bus to the farthest [Hikawa Shrine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3vVRnikJQL3zYuGi6){:target="_blank"}, then stroll back along the way.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*h0c9y56GEfHWTrtP7q8kOQ.png)

Exit directly from the second-floor overpass and go downstairs to the bus boarding area.

#### 11:35 Waiting for the bus at Kawagoe Bus Station

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Z92lcpTR1OitKAL3LRVrtw.png)

Both Platform 1 and Platform 3 have many trains going to Hikawa Shrine. In the end, take the Me 01 from Platform 3.

If you don't have enough change, you can exchange money with the shrine staff. Volunteers nearby can help translate the fortune slips into English for free. If you get a bad fortune, just tie it to the shrine to ward off bad luck.

#### 12:45 Leave Hikawa Shrine

After taking some photos and walking around, I left Hikawa Shrine at about 12:45, ready to take a bus to Koedo Street and Jiikawa MOGUMOGU Honpo Kawagoe store.

#### Seibu — Koedo Loop Bus

![](/assets/958599363857/1*lbJXQmrjFElNnSoh_Rtc2g.jpeg)

While waiting for the bus, I saw a cool sightseeing bus with music — it was the [Seibu Transportation Koedo Loop Bus](https://eaglebus.group/co-edo/zh/){:target="_blank"}; **Tobu passes cannot be used**. You can pay with a transit card or purchase the " [Loop Pass](https://eaglebus.group/co-edo/2025/06/18/ryde0624/){:target="_blank"} " issued by Seibu Railway.

After finishing the walk, it was nearly 14:00, and I was really hungry and tired.

Turn around and go eat Kobe beef across the street.

Didn't get the [numbered ticket](https://chiikawa-info.jp/chiikawaland/tokyo/){:target="_blank"}, so I could only pass by and take some photos. The stock looked plentiful, and there were few people (maybe they controlled too few visitors?).

![](/assets/958599363857/1*RhUU4XWAV_mo818lqez6qw.png)

If you haven't had enough shopping, you can also visit the adjacent Daimaru Department Store or continue exploring other nearby underground shopping streets.

For tax refund on shopping at Tokyo Station, you can go directly to the first floor and find the tax refund counter opposite the Tokaido Sanyo Shinkansen Nihonbashi Exit.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Y0o7PYsSkdhHB0F-pdG6jQ.jpeg)

Bought some items, and since the locker counter closes at 8:00 PM, I looked for coin lockers to store my belongings. There are many lockers available here as well.

> *After storing our luggage, we went to the food court to buy some snacks to eat on the way.*

#### 14:30 Prepare to take the train to Atami

![](/assets/958599363857/1*PgBfGRbUfgWsyh1i24C8Mw.png)

The same applies to entering the Tokaido Sanyo Shinkansen at the Nihonbashi Exit.

For e-tickets purchased in advance on [KKday](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/transportation/japan-rail?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} / [Klook](https://affiliate.klook.com/redirect?aid=99683&aff_adid=1134759&k_site=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.klook.com%2Fzh-TW%2Fjapan-rail%2F){:target="_blank"}, there is no need to exchange for a physical ticket. Just scan the QR code on your phone at the blue gate sensor to enter.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*8XhMmWSYamkoIpZcrcexiw.jpeg)

After successfully entering the station, a ticket will be issued (for easy reference or inspection on the train), but entry and exit still require using the mobile QR code.

Welcome to the 2025 Atami Sea Fireworks Festival!

> *Official reminder: The fireworks festival will be very crowded at the end, so please purchase your Shinkansen tickets in advance.*

After exiting the Shinkansen, you need to pass through the regular train ticket gates (just show the staff your ticket QR code to exit).

The weather is cloudy, but the good thing is it's not too sunny!

![](/assets/958599363857/1*NoN8BV-7HvjIqgoMvrNo_Q.jpeg)

Walk straight through the shopping street and continue down the road to reach the beach.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*xsPseN91hTY7i51fJPjcTA.png)

[The route is shown in the above image](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xZ6QHf3UAWu4iXtD8){:target="_blank"}. First, head to Lawson to buy some food and drinks, then go to the beach for a picnic and wait for the fireworks.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*x0YEr4v70zdBu1cMZyq7zw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*OSrew6n7pXgiQMkmz6TFrw.png)

The fireworks are launched roughly at the location shown above. You can walk to [Higashikaigancho](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XZmFfi3wDBJFERyQ8){:target="_blank"} and wait at the beach towards the back. You can also go into the water here, and there are shared restrooms and showers nearby for changing. (However, it's recommended to check in advance, as some facilities seem old and poorly maintained.)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*93jLDQa0cb1jewFvsazD9Q.jpeg)

You can also enjoy a distant view of Atami Castle from Atami Beach.

#### 17:00 Atami Sunshine Beach

![](/assets/958599363857/1*MaQ6luHYefGS_EdREO8Z8A.jpeg)

It doesn't feel necessary to arrive at Atami so early; the crowd is not as large as expected. There are still beach spots available before around 18:30, and even by the fireworks release at 20:20, there are still places to watch.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*7TaD649tgt3KS0hfcDNuzg.jpeg)

#### 18:00 Atami Fireworks Festival Beach Crowd

![](/assets/958599363857/1*_FH0OfAii22pyLOikGi2Tg.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*ET9HOKp_AUG6BXKz9YFRfQ.jpeg)

You can see that at 18:00 there are still many seats available, or many people come early to lay down picnic mats to reserve spots and then walk around nearby, returning just before the fireworks start.

**Walk a bit further [around the Sky Deck area](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fYK3FxCFxZ8oMzRj6){:target="_blank"}, there is a small night market selling food (not very cost-effective):**

![](/assets/958599363857/1*ABMNXDPrn2rHZ_BT_q6piA.png)

There are restrooms around the beach, so you don't have to worry about not having access.

#### 20:15 Beach crowd near the fireworks release time

![](/assets/958599363857/1*GltFsKbSIEPBGCU0tujfHQ.jpeg)

There are many people on the trail behind.

#### 20:20 Fireworks Festival Begins

![](/assets/958599363857/1*tQkiAdu0D5xhrsRaSwx2ow.jpeg)

[](https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DmI8vaJUpAzY&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=google&display_name=YouTube&src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FmI8vaJUpAzY){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*qsOMKdPSeRp3svZjdxg0bw.png)

The fireworks had several parts and lasted until 20:40 (20 minutes). My favorite part was the magnificent full-screen fireworks. Unfortunately, the humidity was high today, so the smoke lingered and didn’t disperse well towards the end.

#### 20:45 Start leaving the venue

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Is19CY4ydHSl6o_koAwUxw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*-Op_qDpZVTPamDHpMjrLGA.jpeg)

There was a large crowd leaving, but everyone moved toward the station in an orderly manner; it was downhill when arriving and uphill on the way back (tiring).

#### 21:05 Return to Atami Station

![](/assets/958599363857/1*0YVBx1LVIM38oZnnFl-uHw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*AAk3JHAyjLZtD47VozQxhQ.png)

It takes about 20–25 minutes to walk back to Atami Station due to the large crowd, and there are many people entering the station. If you take the local train line, you need to queue slowly to enter. **If you have already purchased your Shinkansen ticket, you can go directly through the manned gate on the right and then transfer from the local line to the Shinkansen platform.**

> *Originally worried about tight timing, I bought the 22:02 train ticket from Atami back to Tokyo; judging by the situation on site, the earlier 21:26 train would have been more than enough.*

#### 21:20 Arrive at the station and wait for the train

![](/assets/958599363857/1*FlXrgL64tIESh9YANzlCgA.png)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*P8UbBT810VfOu1d-FjmGfQ.jpeg)

The Shinkansen here is very spacious, and the air conditioning is cool.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*1yTYNHadfcjXGCssVCOYuQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Xh7kHOo5wLCsZq0HsfcxjA.png)

Bought a can of apple soda to recharge, but heavy rain in other areas caused all trains to be delayed.

#### ~=22:25 Board the train (delayed nearly 20 minutes)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*ffvGyMO0-1naq-JFmy9kfw.png)

#### ~= 23:10 Arrive in Tokyo

Transfer to the Yamanote Line back to Shimbashi.

What a fulfilling day!

### Day 4 (09/16 Tue) — Azabudai TeamLab, Harajuku Shopping, Otter Café

After a good sleep, take the bus out.

#### 10:10 Arrive at [Azabudai Forest](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PbjLmES23cBRVRwK6){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Vxi-ROH7326xUK1Q_RaSSA.jpeg)

I thought Azabudai no Mori only had [JP Tower](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yyYwwHoZbHBmysqN6){:target="_blank"}, but it is actually a whole cluster of fragmented buildings with many department store counters and dining options.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*l04M339xYWoaX0St4PmTGA.jpeg)

First, go to a café for breakfast and to wake up.

#### 10:50 [Head to teamLab Borderless: MORI Building DIGITAL ART MUSEUM (Azabudai Hills Garden Plaza B, B1)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a1VeYdbgBhvPCPXC7){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*G2WDXXLUhC1r2oueJDxDcQ.jpeg)

There is no map inside. If you want to explore everything, you can first get the official guidebook outside.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*GKfgsOIo0qXpIshU_0N3UA.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*6BC5_ZTb1w6zcBWf5mNeng.png)

Turn right for a free luggage storage area. After storing your items, show your ticket to the staff to enter.

#### 11:00 [teamLab Borderless](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a1VeYdbgBhvPCPXC7){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*kTlH8oGRnbrMmf3L_nWSrg.jpeg)

teamLab is truly amazing, featuring various magical and creative scenes that feel unreal. The interactions include light and shadow, mirrors, spheres, pillars, leaves, mist, and more. Almost all are 360-degree full scenes, providing a strong sense of immersion.

> *There is no map; you need to explore all the exhibition rooms on your own. Aprons are thoughtfully provided at the entrance for girls wearing skirts who are concerned about exposure.*

> *Before entering each room, staff usually provide instructions, mostly asking visitors not to touch anything and to walk carefully.*

> *There are restrooms inside, but you need to find the signs yourself or ask the staff.*

![](/assets/958599363857/1*rOQik1WqrSYIlOlNE8GCNg.jpeg)

Photos also look very magical.

![To have seen something, is to not have seen something else](/assets/958599363857/1*-QUcAm5LHPzXTaNqzEe-2g.png)

To have seen something is to have missed something else

> *Left around 12:15, but can't guarantee everything was visited; if not for hunger, spending two to three hours inside would have been no problem.*

#### [HARBS Azabudai Hill Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GYvhb3ucV6Xykrtr9){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*H3hzyw1S7R8QJqGClj7-Kg.jpeg)

Right after visiting teamLab, there is a HARBS nearby. Let's have a fruit mille crepe cake to settle our stomach.

Signature Fruit Mille Crepes Cake (Mille Crepes/ミルクレープ) 1 slice ￥1,050 + minimum one drink order.

> *Contains cantaloupe (very sweet and delicious) + banana + kiwi.*

#### 13:20 Tokyo Tower

![](/assets/958599363857/1*bxUphy3A0fYyf5koQkTQNw.jpeg)

[Visited last time and went up as well **(please refer to the previous travelogue)**](https://zhgchg.li/posts/z-%E5%BA%A6%E6%97%85%E8%A1%8C%E9%81%8A%E8%A8%98/%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E8%A1%8C%E6%94%BB%E7%95%A5-5-%E5%A4%A9%E9%A3%9F%E4%BD%8F%E8%A1%8C%E5%85%A8%E8%A8%98%E9%8C%84%E8%88%87%E5%BF%85%E8%A8%AA%E6%99%AF%E9%BB%9E%E6%8E%A8%E8%96%A6-9da2c51fa4f2/#%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC%E9%90%B5%E5%A1%94){:target="_blank"}, this time we just passed by and took some photos.

Take the train to Harajuku.

#### 14:00 Harajuku

![](/assets/958599363857/1*6SJEx_1Xe1cRtxNtxCACUw.jpeg)

As soon as I came out, I saw KiiKawa again and again. Upstairs at [Tokyu Plaza Omotesando Harajuku](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qo9uS7tVHoRda1MQ7){:target="_blank"} is the [KiiKawa Bakery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7rPeXTvCVEtWonMd7){:target="_blank"}.

The bread and jam shop on the left requires a numbered ticket for entry; the doll merchandise store on the right does not.

(Because I just happened to pass by, I didn't go in)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*BAveEbCyszfKzZc3L7CE9w.jpeg)

The nearby stores have a good supply of goods, but I already have too many sweet potatoes and can't buy more. I just looked around without buying anything.

#### [Kiddy Land キデイランド 原宿店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JBGBKiEBNdcycYPz8){:target="_blank"}

Afterward, we went to another nearby Kiddy Land to browse. ([But this one doesn't have Jiikawa](https://www.kiddyland.co.jp/harajuku/){:target="_blank"})

![](/assets/958599363857/1*WTTkpsTLZ9_35_KVXD01wQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*KG4Y3IlpSLIcD-SOBxb4Ug.jpeg)

There are many IPs like Snoopy, Sanrio, Pokémon, Rilakkuma, and more.

By the time we finished strolling around, it was nearly 3:00 PM. We had only eaten a piece of fruit mille-feuille for lunch and felt a bit hungry, so we casually picked a highly rated American burger joint we passed by to eat.

#### [14:50 The Great Burger](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xgoLanLfSSYFC5jP9){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*CxJhjOkE7NSkV2wwiZWlWA.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*0wzaWAsar2xUmujgMfHVUg.jpeg)

The specialty is Wagyu mini burgers.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Anb4bgPGloM3oNkV6btS-g.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*2x_JAyGUZmJ58CSR30Rr7A.jpeg)

The taste is quite good, but eating too much can be overwhelming.

#### 15:40 Shopping in Harajuku

After eating, continue exploring Harajuku and wait until the evening (16:30) to go to the reserved Otter Café.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*sWQbbQUfLq3EWzMhJrvTng.jpeg)

Just wandering around and ended up at the same Le Labo perfume store as last time. In Japan 2025, the price for 50ml perfume is ¥31,350, and after tax refund, it's about ¥28,500.

#### 16:30 [HARRY HARAJUKU terrace Otter Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WHyJ88K5hRVc4vnk9){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*b20FSUf7uuIrFFNRLP6vwQ.jpeg)

Go to the top floor of this building and take the stairs on the side up.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*eoDe1nHReBDY4bv070eEBQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*x3phhvrHJ3ocidaw3glJLw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*CpEDCXiZ8Js_st4tzrXtGA.jpeg)

The venue is small, with three pools outside where three otters roam around. You can buy snacks to feed them (¥880). (They will reach out their paws)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*U30ypE-233jdjvcR0aejGA.jpeg)

The coffee is from a vending machine that you operate yourself. (Buy 30 minutes and get 1 cup free)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*fBpOYC967t_nalgHfuGCEg.png)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*3dL7ITdswBmvR6KUU9MQSw.jpeg)

The venue inside is not very large. In the middle, there is a paid interactive otter area (additional fee required), next to it is a paid Totoro interactive zone, and on the other side is a free hedgehog interaction area, along with a few otters in a fenced enclosure.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*L1tbx1lOqgPbpgBmEhGkVA.jpeg)

We added ¥880 per person for a 5-minute close interaction with the otters; otherwise, you can't actually touch them.

#### 17:20 [Pet the Otters](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WHyJ88K5hRVc4vnk9){:target="_blank"}

> *There were quite a few visitors interacting with the otters, and it was our turn only at 17:20. The staff keeps track of the time.*

You can gently pet his belly while he’s eating; his fur is very soft.

> ***Overall: The rating might only be around 2.5–3 stars***

> *The overall venue is too small. The basic fee is ¥3,080 per person for one hour. Except for the hedgehogs, there is no interaction with other animals, and the coffee is only from a vending machine. Although the staff are gentle with the animals, the other otters resting nearby or those in the outdoor pool have very limited space to move, which feels a bit sad.*

> *It looks different from the size of a typical café I imagined, and there are otters running around.*

#### 18:00 Head to Shibuya

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Do_SdWdOCG8ZhXXDVcyEtg.jpeg)

#### 18:20 Queue at [Gokumiya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oZR5RprBErWbkAjq8){:target="_blank"}

It's still early, so I came back to Shibuya and started with a meal at Gokumiya.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*bA7IPZZUq2LVdCbFs9H5lw.png)

At this time, there weren't many people, so we waited in line briefly and got to eat quickly.

I ate too much hamburger steak at lunch and felt full. I ordered the pure beef steak set on the left, and the juice was delicious.

> [*Last time I had the hamburger steak + beef steak set*](https://zhgchg.li/posts/z-%E5%BA%A6%E6%97%85%E8%A1%8C%E9%81%8A%E8%A8%98/%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E8%A1%8C%E6%94%BB%E7%95%A5-5-%E5%A4%A9%E9%A3%9F%E4%BD%8F%E8%A1%8C%E5%85%A8%E8%A8%98%E9%8C%84%E8%88%87%E5%BF%85%E8%A8%AA%E6%99%AF%E9%BB%9E%E6%8E%A8%E8%96%A6-9da2c51fa4f2/#%E6%B8%8B%E8%B0%B7-parco--%E6%A5%B5%E5%91%B3%E5%B1%8B){:target="*blank"} _Just remember to bring two pairs of chopsticks: metal ones for grilling and wooden ones for eating._**

#### Shopping and Buying Cosmetics

![](/assets/958599363857/1*mOCaZv_M3wUL_shhpsklRw.jpeg)

At the department store, I stopped by the fragrance section and bought two bottles along with a pillow spray to try at home.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*hHziMmw8-TXZgTU96AaLAQ.jpeg)

After eating, we strolled around Shibuya a bit more, then went back to the hotel to get some money and buy cosmetics at a drugstore. After returning to the hotel to rest, we prepared to say goodbye to Tokyo.

Ate too much meat, let's just have dessert tonight!

> *Also, a colleague bought donuts for us at [I’m donut? Harajuku](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ptoRy58awP8gVibR6){:target="_blank"}. (No need to queue in Japan, unlike in Taiwan)*

### Day 5 (09/17 Wed) — Ueno Station, Return Trip

#### 10:50 Leave before the final check-out time

![](/assets/958599363857/1*_fnEVTQzT63qUc3tmEtY5A.jpeg)

Goodbye, Shimbashi.

Take the Yamanote Line to Ueno.

#### 11:10 Arrive at Ueno Station

![](/assets/958599363857/1*O_gvBqPHvCHYXyWu3h2sjw.jpeg)

Didn’t explore much, worried about not finding a place to store luggage, so I used the locker service inside the station.

> *Later found it quite not cost-effective because you have to pick up items and pay to enter the station, plus it's expensive; the main point is that it's out of the way.*

> ***Later I found out that the Skyliner Keisei Ueno is at Ueno Station Yamashita Exit or Shinobazu Exit*** *You can reach it inside the station without going outside in the sun (but it's easy to get lost inside the station); if you want to use the lockers here, you need to walk back (about 15 minutes), but there are many coin lockers there as well.*

Exit here and you'll see Ueno Zoo. Turn left, **get ready to reserve your seat for the Skyliner Keisei Ueno.**

Finally saw the Skyliner Keisei Ueno Station.

> *Since all seats on the Skyliner are reserved, it is recommended to book your seat in advance for safety.*

> *The station staff speaks Chinese (I just didn't realize he was speaking Chinese at first).*

Spend the last moments strolling around Ueno.

There is also a second store next door.

> *Opposite is another exit of Ueno Station. Ueno Station is really huge…*

The geographical location is roughly as shown in the above image.

#### 12:00 Visit [Marui Department Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DvPAhnaEz8HYGSQs7){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*XoxAFbNqAcwJ8YDPjQlQxw.jpeg)

There is a gacha capsule toy area on the second floor.

Got a [Shinkansen ticket gacha](https://www.so-ta.com/products_detail/capsuletoy/tokaido_shinkansen/){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*rysyBldMgjEOuR__7hQuOg.jpeg)

I also got tempted and bought a ReFa heart-shaped massage brush at Loft.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*sGjazwQmnuqRKWbTubIZXA.png)

Ate croissants here to fill up.

#### 13:20 Return to Ueno Station

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Ht4JmIU70nKQWu560yEM2A.jpeg)

Also, stop by to buy Sugar Butter Tree as a souvenir.

Finally, I returned to the Park Exit to pick up my luggage, took a long walk, and then went back to Keisei Ueno.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*oR_x1HqE9qwg094sF-uygA.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*maLcXgZQHSKZdJB2CQngZg.jpeg)

The route is a bit unusual; you need to go down to the platform first and then exit from another exit to reach Shinobazu.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*XLFR3n_fxsGWBK6sU5Lkhw.jpeg)

This underground passage has many coin-operated lockers and is quite spacious.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*TyOvYS_0FCfSujRBojgRvg.jpeg)

I couldn’t bring myself to say it, but crossing the street leads directly to Skyliner Keisei Ueno. (Not sure if there’s a closer exit; I didn’t wander around to avoid getting lost.)

#### 14:10 Return to Skyliner Keisei Ueno, prepare to take the train to Narita Airport

![](/assets/958599363857/1*j-oOGCBRflbJWVfkQLrA_Q.png)

#### 14:20 Depart for Narita Airport

![](/assets/958599363857/1*-bEzz-shmaBClAhFkmjf8A.jpeg)

Just stopped by a convenience store on the way to buy some food and drinks to recharge.

#### 15:03 Arrive at Narita Airport Terminal 2

![](/assets/958599363857/1*6thsMc0VyilD-DBmtf85Aw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*lpge7uQIA81oEOD9JjK3pQ.jpeg)

Once you go straight up, you will reach the international departures.

> *Originally planned to eat at [the newly opened Shake Shack burger](https://matcha-jp.com/tw/25632){:target="_blank"} at the airport, but was too tired to go.*

#### 15:40 Complete Check-in

![](/assets/958599363857/1*qtNeXNg2HuWhOQBd0YqnyQ.png)

> [*You can complete online check-in and seat selection 24 hours before departure, then go straight to baggage drop at the airport to speed up the process.*](https://digital.jal.co.jp/ssci/identification?lang=zh-tw){:target="_blank"}

After checking in luggage, I went straight to line up for departure (tired).

#### 16:00 Complete security check and immigration clearance

![](/assets/958599363857/1*41hw6bw7XnkIpESE-es7iw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*XksioltS7RRgmtf4Gz-N3A.jpeg)

Walk towards the direction with smaller numbers to reach the central connecting hall, where you can find food and shops.

#### First, go to JAPAN FOOD HALL B1 to grab something to eat

![](/assets/958599363857/1*xj-6KVdDgwx_GPgGF0bHqQ.jpeg)

#### 16:25 Snack time

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Khh3IUrvCCYk1Ccx_fiF7w.png)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*bgttA6-L8uW93zM7TpwOmw.jpeg)

> *Ordered a tempura shrimp soba with draft beer.*

> *Actual cost: 955 TWD (Airport prices are just expensive…)*

#### 16:50 Duty-Free Shops and Souvenir Stores Shopping

![](/assets/958599363857/1*39UCCUtGuFBVV1FEBQG-9A.png)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*UrCaiyBHekSvy0tzTbM5Gw.png)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*_ID9YTxBia4tz-CaQrGcEw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*DubJNBeqI-tWI5amx_VbbQ.jpeg)

Narita Airport duty-free shops really have everything. Besides luxury goods, skincare products, and tobacco and alcohol, there are also well-stocked souvenir shops with a wide variety of items. Prices are similar to or even cheaper than outside. If you haven't bought enough, you can take advantage of last-minute shopping before boarding.

#### 17:05 Le Labo

![](/assets/958599363857/1*J2hChay4G6BPHCItaueHFA.jpeg)

Actually, without specifically looking, I unexpectedly found La Lebo at Narita Airport in [Fa-So-La DUTY FREE Cosmetics & Perfumery](https://www.fasola.jp/en/searchByBrand.aspx){:target="_blank"}. According to the official website, both Terminal 1 and 2 have it.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*9XCr-56Q5AlUCDRedP1cBA.jpeg)

> *Even more surprising is the price, **50ml — ¥25,700**, which is cheaper than the tax-refunded price of ¥28,500 within Japan.*

![](/assets/958599363857/1*ar416ZWoAliERsR_Fg1GJQ.jpeg)

Finally, I couldn't resist and bought a 26–30ml bottle (airport exclusive size), actually spending NT$3,720.

#### 17:30 Head to the boarding gate and wait

![](/assets/958599363857/1*5PiE4fENJsi1dynUUL08OQ.jpeg)

Gate 67B is in a very corner and far away; unfortunately, there were no vending machines selling peach water along the way.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*K8V9RnmpGnx--VJ8HTZOaw.png)

#### 17:50 Boarding, Goodbye Tokyo!

![](/assets/958599363857/1*OxCGLuV_XrFB_c-BHM10gA.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*0qZy2nb8aXRxB1fmR-uCUA.jpeg)

The aircraft model is BOEING 737–800, the same as the one on the way here.

#### Narita Airport was heavily congested. The flight was originally scheduled to depart at 18:10 but ended up waiting in line until nearly 19:00 to take off.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*LbcG5trqHcp_4GejuI6iDg.jpeg)

#### Japan Airlines Free In-flight WiFi

![](/assets/958599363857/1*1sP5H5jRMsQxm02W2TG6QA.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*eZ9beWgHlSQufFt-2Mnegg.jpeg)

I accidentally discovered that the plane offers one hour of free WiFi.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*5CozWE6P0BhIjE6vksu9cQ.jpeg)

The airplane meal was also excellent, featuring curry pork cutlet rice and Haagen-Dazs dessert.

#### 21:07 Return to Taiwan

#### Souvenirs
