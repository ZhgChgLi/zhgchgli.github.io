Summer Fireworks in Atami

Taking advantage of the start of my new job to fully recharge, [Revisiting Tokyo](../9da2c51fa4f2/) — experiencing a once-in-a-lifetime Japanese fireworks festival and a day trip to Kawagoe near Tokyo.

#### Last Trip

> *Last time, in the [**[Travelogue] 2023 Tokyo 5-Day Free Trip**](../9da2c51fa4f2/), I visited Tokyo in June 2023. It wasn’t as hot as in September. The main places I went to were: Tokyo Tower, Shibuya Sky, Skytree, Asakusa Kaminarimon, DisneySea, Yokohama Gundam, Yokohama Cable Car, Odaiba, Shinjuku, and the Imperial Palace.*

### Accommodation

Because the booking time was close to the departure date, after comparing prices and convenience, I chose to stay near Shimbashi Station. (Last time I stayed in Shiodome, but Shimbashi felt more convenient.)

#### [Daiwa Roynet Hotel Shimbashi, Tokyo](https://affiliate.klook.com/redirect?aid=99683&aff_adid=1134759&k_site=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.klook.com%2Fzh-TW%2Fhotels%2Fdetail%2F127656-daiwa-roynet-hotel-shimbashi%2F){:target="_blank"} (4 nights)

### Day 1 (09/13 Sat) — Arrive in Tokyo, Shibuya Sky

#### 06:50 Take airport shuttle

#### 07:20 Arrive at Taoyuan Airport Terminal 2

![](/assets/958599363857/1*TkF8qP3e1-iladiHOZgERQ.jpeg)

#### 07:30 Pack and Check-in Luggage

![](/assets/958599363857/1*sNzgznqv8RxRYfwyCaIntg.png)

Assigned to counter number 1 at the corner, I had already completed [online check-in](https://digital.jal.co.jp/ssci/identification?lang=zh-tw){:target="_blank"} in advance and went straight to check in my luggage. However, the people ahead took a long time, so it took about 30 minutes to finish the luggage check-in process.

#### ~= 08:20 Complete security check and immigration clearance

![](/assets/958599363857/1*lKRxUWP4BGQA1q97X3jJJg.jpeg)

There were quite a few people early in the morning. I finished security and immigration around 8:20 and went to the second floor to have a Mos Burger for breakfast. The assigned boarding gate was also the farthest one, D1.

#### Terminal 2 Departure Duty-Free Shop Le Labo

![](/assets/958599363857/1*wyJNusrf7ElLdfZ33YaPWA.jpeg)

Unexpectedly found Le Labo at Terminal 2 departure duty-free shop. The sales clerk mentioned a current promotion: new members get a coupon discount, making the 50ml price NT $5,500, cheaper than buying inside Japan (about NT $5,800).

**Latest Price List for 2025 — 50ml:**

- Taiwan store price: NT $7,600

- Taiwan airport duty-free price: NT $5,500 (promotional price)

- Tax-refunded price at Japanese stores: approximately NT $5,700

- [**Japan Airport Stores**](https://www.fasola.jp/en/searchByBrand.aspx){:target="_blank"} **Duty-free price: about NT $5,200 🤩 — I bought mine at Narita Airport** Terminal 2 **after passing through security this time.**

![](/assets/958599363857/1*I6HuL5NdPzQxp3lu43fiUw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*gkCuhDtktYmN6ed170fRZg.jpeg)

While wandering around the airport waiting for boarding, there are two rows of free massage chairs next to D1 The North Face (you can get free tokens from nearby stores to use them).

#### 09:40 Head to the gate to prepare for boarding

![](/assets/958599363857/1*U5QpF19SbJlVAllxZZiQMA.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*izSSFMEAPqbhFtTgt13ndw.jpeg)

The plane I took this time was a BOEING 737–800 model, which is a bit old.

> *But I found out after returning that there was a free one-hour WiFi service on the plane.*

#### 10:06 Departure

![](/assets/958599363857/1*McNWkLo576Z3uJTm9QgYWA.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*tu0L7uohZIqsd9V4JlKGFg.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*s69aVqVz7J7wXFSNi66SsQ.jpeg)

Although the plane is a bit old, the in-flight meal is really good: hamburger meat sauce pasta, a small bowl of cold soba noodles with tofu skin, and lemon pudding for dessert (delicious!).

#### 14:39 Landed at Narita International Airport, Japan (14 minutes delayed)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*0Dvy2jcY6ED8uW6NgmxcXw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*W_bKd7fHb6kBH3uKPqepPg.jpeg)

The floor was a bit damp, and the weather was cloudy, indicating it had rained heavily earlier; upon arrival, we started the Narita Airport ground game (it takes about 5 minutes to walk from the plane to immigration).

#### ~= 15:05 Complete immigration procedures and collect luggage to exit the airport

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Xru5o3DBU_GZyTlVW8Wfcw.png)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*oD9JhXDuh47h4aBYxepu7Q.jpeg)

After exiting the airport, take the escalator down to the "Railway" direction. Find the "SKYLINER & KEISEI INFORMATION CENTER" counter and show the QR code of the [Skyliner Keisei Railway Ticket](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/7913-keisei-skyliner-narita-airport-express-ticket?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} purchased online.

Missed the 15:16 train, so can only take the 15:42 one.

At the station, you can buy [Welcome Suica (must be used within 28 days)](https://www.jreast.co.jp/zh-CHT/multi/welcomesuica/welcomesuica.html){:target="_blank"} and use the regular Suica card recharge machines. You can top up the amount needed for your trip while waiting for your train. ([But I personally use Suica on my iPhone for convenience and ease!](https://zhgchg.li/posts/z-%E5%BA%A6%E6%97%85%E8%A1%8C%E9%81%8A%E8%A8%98/%E4%BA%AC%E9%98%AA%E7%A5%9E%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E8%A1%8C%E6%94%BB%E7%95%A5-%E4%BA%AC%E9%83%BD%E5%A4%A7%E9%98%AA%E7%A5%9E%E6%88%B68%E6%97%A5%E9%81%8A%E5%85%A8%E7%B4%80%E9%8C%84%E8%88%87%E5%AF%A6%E7%94%A8%E4%BA%A4%E9%80%9A%E4%BD%8F%E5%AE%BF%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97-76d66c2e34af/#-2){:target="_blank"} )

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Rx_dIfNqzUwhc21VzUvIkw.png)

Follow the signs for the "Keisei Line" and find the corresponding platform to wait.

#### ~= 15:42 Boarding

![](/assets/958599363857/1*gM-xQihcfGhbEXFv8_uxIg.png)

This platform serves many train types, so please confirm before boarding; staff will also make announcements along the way and may check your ticket. [**Narita Express requires reserved seats for all cars, no non-reserved seating**](https://www.jreast.co.jp/tc/downloads/pdf/ntrt10_tc.pdf){:target="_blank"}. **Do not board without a ticket**.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*IEQNy3qmUMrm_GaBAFqUTw.jpeg)

The seats on the Narita Express are spacious enough to fit a 28-inch suitcase; if it's tight, you can place it in the front or rear luggage areas of the car, or on the luggage rack (just be careful when taking it down).

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Z0UWLv0qvBf77Ue0xfUQ4w.jpeg)

The weather is cloudy.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*09O3hfLEqGKXuUjmv5ALMA.jpeg)

It's just a short walk from Shimbashi Station, very convenient!

The hotel provides many free amenities, including face masks, bath additives, earplugs, portable mouthwash, and more.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*JXSKiQeoOOtAlQt946SXiw.jpeg)

It's somewhat like the [**trip to Hiroshima and Okayama the year before last**](../31b9b3a63abc/), staying at the "[Rifumax Okayama Kurashiki Station Front Hotel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmwHRihsyXI){:target="_blank"}," where the room was very small, feeling like a single room but with a double bed.

> *The drawbacks, besides being small, include the room refrigerator lacking a freezer function.*

After putting down our things, we headed to Shibuya.

#### 18:30 Queue to enter Shibuya SKY

On the first floor of Shibuya Scramble Square, find the elevator to go up to the "Shibuya SKY" observation deck. After queuing for the elevator, show your QR code to the ticket inspector to queue for entry. (Ticket will be scanned upon entry)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*XTalH3d03U4tmBXD-iK5yw.jpeg)

You can see the Shibuya Crossing from here.

> *After arriving, first use the free locker to store your belongings. Selfie sticks and similar items are not allowed.*

The third season of "Alice in Borderland" is about to premiere, so let's revisit the scenes; it feels like there are many more people than before.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*nSlNoHtXjCcmZwLJdhK5Wg.png)

Cross the street and head straight to Shibuya Parco, aiming to eat at [Gokumiya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B11rcg3MLFRgJLqT8){:target="_blank"}.

> [*Tried it once last time and can't forget it.*](https://zhgchg.li/posts/z-%E5%BA%A6%E6%97%85%E8%A1%8C%E9%81%8A%E8%A8%98/%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E8%A1%8C%E6%94%BB%E7%95%A5-5-%E5%A4%A9%E9%A3%9F%E4%BD%8F%E8%A1%8C%E5%85%A8%E8%A8%98%E9%8C%84%E8%88%87%E5%BF%85%E8%A8%AA%E6%99%AF%E9%BB%9E%E6%8E%A8%E8%96%A6-9da2c51fa4f2/#%E6%B8%8B%E8%B0%B7-parco--%E6%A5%B5%E5%91%B3%E5%B1%8B){:target="_blank"}

#### 20:00 Arrive at Shibuya Parco

![](/assets/958599363857/1*5UmVsCAy5wcJHCK9h8xQvg.png)

Unfortunately, [Gokumiya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B11rcg3MLFRgJLqT8){:target="_blank"} was sold out (will come back in a few days), so we tried another kushikatsu (fried skewer) shop in the same food street.

#### 20:15 [Kushikatsu Arata Shibuya Parco](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PTZVZEqdZayWUiap9){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*cbSR83bqt56GgvT8gTYRQw.jpeg)

Ordered several signature fried skewers, double meat fried skewers, a bowl of beef brisket rice, and two drinks, totaling ¥6,340 JPY.

> *The Japanese-style crispy skewers are tasty and not greasy, and the beef brisket rice is flavorful and satisfying.*

> ***Note that the fried skewer shop charges an extra basic fee for cabbage (お通し)*** *, I forgot the exact amount, but it should be around* ¥ *300 per person.*

#### 21:30 [C-pla Shibuya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bTwvHKkbxHofxnig6){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*a8oZSBgBI3ZIOftsOxSH5A.jpeg)

On the way back to the station after eating, I passed by a large C-pla gacha shop and went in to hunt for treasures.

> *Nothing I want to twist here, retreat!*

#### Good night! Tokyo

![](/assets/958599363857/1*WwT578CuW9uDdF6FEoJogA.jpeg)

Buy some late-night snacks and head back to the hotel to rest.

### Day 2 (09/14) — Kawagoe Day Trip, Ikebukuro Shopping

#### 09:30 Head out and have McDonald's breakfast first — [McDonald’s 新橋日比谷口店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7kZzxwNhtNjBKdZC9){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*ylLKnhvJGSh1inGDz4QPXw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*PBCIcEtyaPLO7bcKEr_X9A.jpeg)

The same waffle ham, cheese, and egg burger!

> *This McDonald's [was visited last time as well](../9da2c51fa4f2/). The drawbacks are that it is old, the environment is not very clean, and there is no self-order kiosk.*

#### 10:50 Arrive at Ikebukuro Station (Take Yamanote Line)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*1V90DtPc7kU51PnAhjgL8A.png)

Transfer to the Tobu Tojo Line to go to Kawagoe.

**We purchased the [Kawagoe Pass (Train + Bus)](https://affiliate.klook.com/redirect?aid=99683&aff_adid=1134759&k_site=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.klook.com%2Fzh-TW%2Factivity%2F100464-kawagoe-pass-digital-ticket%2F){:target="_blank"} online in advance, and activated it online to start the timer:**

![](/assets/958599363857/1*pxQYLZnHM7-UA6B7RisQnw.jpeg)

After exiting from the station office at the very edge, I first picked up a tourist brochure and decided to take a bus to the farthest [Hikawa Shrine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3vVRnikJQL3zYuGi6){:target="_blank"}, then walk back while sightseeing.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*h0c9y56GEfHWTrtP7q8kOQ.png)

Exit directly from the second-floor pedestrian bridge and go downstairs to the bus boarding area.

#### 11:35 Waiting for the bus at Kawagoe Bus Station

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Z92lcpTR1OitKAL3LRVrtw.png)

Both Platform 1 and Platform 3 have many trains going to Hikawa Shrine. In the end, I took the Me 01 from Platform 3.

> ***As long as you recognize "東武* バス *", use the [Kawagoe Pass (Train + Bus)](https://affiliate.klook.com/redirect?aid=99683&aff_adid=1134759&k_site=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.klook.com%2Fzh-TW%2Factivity%2F100464-kawagoe-pass-digital-ticket%2F){:target="_blank"} without special exchange; just show the QR code to the driver when getting off.***

If you don’t have enough coins, you can exchange money with the shrine staff. Volunteers nearby can help translate the fortune in English for free. If you get a bad fortune, just tie it to the shrine (which means to ward off bad luck).

#### 12:45 Leave Hikawa Shrine

After taking some photos and walking around, we left Hikawa Shrine at about 12:45, ready to head to Koedo Street and 吉伊カワ MOGUMOGU Honpo Kawagoe store.

#### Seibu — Little Edo Loop Bus

![](/assets/958599363857/1*lbJXQmrjFElNnSoh_Rtc2g.jpeg)

While waiting for the bus, I saw a cool sightseeing bus with music — it was the [Seibu Transportation Koedo Loop Bus](https://eaglebus.group/co-edo/zh/){:target="_blank"}; **Tobu passes cannot be used**. You can pay with a transportation card or buy the Seibu Railway issued "[Pass](https://eaglebus.group/co-edo/2025/06/18/ryde0624/){:target="_blank"}".

Although there is still full-day capacity control, the crowd is less than when it first opened. We arrived on site and scanned the QR code to book the next available slot at 13:40 (there were still seats). If you’re worried about missing out, you can book online in advance.

After finishing, it was nearly 14:00, and I was really hungry and tired.

Walk up to the second-floor café in a historic building, grab a quick bite, then continue on.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*QcyUQuLZg3kb-TuYqJzERg.png)

> *If it weren't for being too hungry and it being late, I would have wanted to queue for soba noodles.*

After eating, walk out to the terrace to take photos:

#### 17:10 Ikebukuro Station Parco

![](/assets/958599363857/1*w50-WxlZgKpVvH5aIQR7BQ.png)

After returning to Ikebukuro, first explore the department stores at Ikebukuro Station. There are Parco and Tobu Department Store, offering many things to browse.

#### [THE GUEST cafe & diner Ikebukuro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tGxXYhytPWoMXzY6A){:target="_blank"} 、 [Chikawa Ramen Pork](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Xjj1pvnPpyyvUGH48){:target="_blank"}

Walked all the way to the world's largest capsule toy store to hunt for treasures.

**There is also a [Gokumiya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vkmPHf4j6SgRGprb8){:target="_blank"} at Tokyo Station**, but it gets very crowded. It opens at 11:00, and many people are already lining up by then. It looks like the wait time is about an hour.

Turn around and go eat Kobe beef across the street.

Just like the nostalgic taste, the meat is tender, with no off-flavors, only the natural aroma of beef; before I knew it, it was all gone!

#### 12:20 Start exploring Tokyo Station Underground First Avenue

Did not get a [ticket](https://chiikawa-info.jp/chiikawaland/tokyo/){:target="_blank"}, so just passed by to take some photos. The stock looked ample, and there were few people (maybe they controlled the crowd too loosely?).

![](/assets/958599363857/1*RhUU4XWAV_mo818lqez6qw.png)

If you haven't had enough shopping, you can visit the nearby Daimaru Department Store or continue walking to other surrounding underground shopping streets.

#### 14:00 Tax Refund and Luggage Storage at Tokyo Station

![](/assets/958599363857/1*V1V-6jaK-XgaIJtFUqaUTQ.png)

For tax refund on shopping at Tokyo Station, you can go directly back to the first floor and find the tax refund counter opposite the Tokaido Sanyo Shinkansen Nihombashi Exit.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Y0o7PYsSkdhHB0F-pdG6jQ.jpeg)

Bought some items, but since the locker counter closes at 8:00 PM, I looked for coin lockers to store them. There are many lockers available here as well.

> *After storing the luggage, I went to the food court to buy some snacks to eat on the way.*

#### 14:30 Prepare to take the train to Atami

![](/assets/958599363857/1*PgBfGRbUfgWsyh1i24C8Mw.png)

Also entering the Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen at the Nihonbashi entrance.

For e-tickets purchased in advance on [KKday](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/transportation/japan-rail?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} / [Klook](https://affiliate.klook.com/redirect?aid=99683&aff_adid=1134759&k_site=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.klook.com%2Fzh-TW%2Fjapan-rail%2F){:target="_blank"}, there is no need to exchange for a paper ticket. Simply use the blue gate and hold your phone’s QR code close to the sensor to enter.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*8XhMmWSYamkoIpZcrcexiw.jpeg)

Entering the station successfully will print out a ticket (for easy reference or onboard inspection), but entry and exit still require the mobile QR code.

#### 14:57 Depart Tokyo for Atami

Welcome to the 2025 Atami Sea Fireworks Festival!

> *Official reminder: There will be large crowds after the fireworks festival, so please purchase Shinkansen tickets in advance.*

After exiting the Shinkansen, you still need to pass through the conventional line ticket gate (just show your ticket QR code to the staff to exit).

![](/assets/958599363857/1*MzafXGx-5W__v6ER9L55qg.jpeg)

The weather was cloudy, but the advantage was that it wasn’t too sunny!

![](/assets/958599363857/1*NoN8BV-7HvjIqgoMvrNo_Q.jpeg)

Walk straight through the shopping street and continue down to reach the beach.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*xsPseN91hTY7i51fJPjcTA.png)

[Route as shown in the picture above](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xZ6QHf3UAWu4iXtD8){:target="_blank"}, first head to Lawson to buy some food and drinks, then go to the beach for a picnic and wait for the fireworks.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*x0YEr4v70zdBu1cMZyq7zw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*OSrew6n7pXgiQMkmz6TFrw.png)

The fireworks are launched roughly at the location shown above. You can walk to [Higashikaigancho](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XZmFfi3wDBJFERyQ8){:target="_blank"} and wait on the beach further back. Here, you can also go into the water, and there are shared restrooms and showers nearby for changing. (However, it's recommended to check in advance, as some facilities seem to be old and poorly maintained.)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*93jLDQa0cb1jewFvsazD9Q.jpeg)

At Atami Beach, you can also enjoy a distant view of Atami Castle.

#### 17:00 Atami Sunshine Beach

![](/assets/958599363857/1*MaQ6luHYefGS_EdREO8Z8A.jpeg)

It doesn't feel necessary to arrive in Atami so early; the crowd is not as large as expected. You can still find beach spots before around 18:30, and even if the fireworks start at 20:20, there are still places available to watch.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*7TaD649tgt3KS0hfcDNuzg.jpeg)

#### 18:00 Atami Fireworks Festival Beach Crowd

![](/assets/958599363857/1*_FH0OfAii22pyLOikGi2Tg.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*ET9HOKp_AUG6BXKz9YFRfQ.jpeg)

You can see that at 18:00 there are still many seats available, or many people come early to lay down picnic mats to reserve spots and then walk around nearby, returning just before the fireworks start.

**A little further ahead [around the Sky Deck area](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fYK3FxCFxZ8oMzRj6){:target="_blank"}, there is a small night market selling food (though the cost performance is not great):**

![](/assets/958599363857/1*ABMNXDPrn2rHZ_BT_q6piA.png)

There are restrooms around the beach, so you don't have to worry about not having access.

#### 20:15 Beach Crowd Near Fireworks Release Time

![](/assets/958599363857/1*MhEq7Oix6_1SHWcLHWXxLg.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*GltFsKbSIEPBGCU0tujfHQ.jpeg)

There are many people on the trail behind.

#### 20:20 Fireworks Festival Begins

![](/assets/958599363857/1*tQkiAdu0D5xhrsRaSwx2ow.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*qsOMKdPSeRp3svZjdxg0bw.png)

The fireworks had several parts, lasting until 20:40 (20 minutes). My favorite part was the grand display covering the entire sky. Unfortunately, the humidity was high today, so the smoke lingered and didn't disperse well towards the end.

#### 20:45 Start Leaving

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Is19CY4ydHSl6o_koAwUxw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*-Op_qDpZVTPamDHpMjrLGA.jpeg)

There were many people leaving, but everyone moved slowly and orderly toward the station; it was downhill coming in and uphill going back (tiring).

#### 21:05 Return to Atami Station

![](/assets/958599363857/1*0YVBx1LVIM38oZnnFl-uHw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*AAk3JHAyjLZtD47VozQxhQ.png)

It takes about 20–25 minutes to walk back to Atami Station due to the large crowd, and there are many people entering the station. If you take the local train line, you need to queue slowly to enter. **If you have already purchased a Shinkansen ticket, you can go directly through the manned gate on the right, then cross to the local line platform to transfer to the Shinkansen.**

> *Originally worried about tight timing, I bought a 22:02 ticket from Atami to Tokyo; judging by the situation on site, the earlier 21:26 train would have been more than enough.*

#### 21:20 Arrive at the station and wait for the train

![](/assets/958599363857/1*FlXrgL64tIESh9YANzlCgA.png)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*P8UbBT810VfOu1d-FjmGfQ.jpeg)

The Shinkansen here is very spacious and the air conditioning is cool.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*1yTYNHadfcjXGCssVCOYuQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Xh7kHOo5wLCsZq0HsfcxjA.png)

Bought a can of apple soda to recharge, but heavy rain in other areas caused all flights to be delayed.

#### ~=22:25 Board the train (delayed by nearly 20 minutes)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*ffvGyMO0-1naq-JFmy9kfw.png)

#### ~= 23:10 Arrive in Tokyo

Transfer to the Yamanote Line back to Shimbashi.

What a fulfilling day!

### Day 4 (09/16 Tue) — Azabudai TeamLab, Harajuku Shopping, Otter Café

After a good sleep, take the bus out.

#### 10:10 Arrive at [Azabudai Forest](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PbjLmES23cBRVRwK6){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Vxi-ROH7326xUK1Q_RaSSA.jpeg)

I thought Azabudai no Mori only had [JP Tower](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yyYwwHoZbHBmysqN6){:target="_blank"}, but it is actually a whole complex of fragmented buildings with many department store counters and food options.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*l04M339xYWoaX0St4PmTGA.jpeg)

First, go to a café for breakfast and to wake up.

#### 10:50 [Head to teamLab Borderless: MORI Building DIGITAL ART MUSEUM (Azabudai Hills Garden Plaza B, B1)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a1VeYdbgBhvPCPXC7){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*G2WDXXLUhC1r2oueJDxDcQ.jpeg)

There is no map inside. If you want to explore everything, you can first get the official guidebook outside.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*GKfgsOIo0qXpIshU_0N3UA.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*6BC5_ZTb1w6zcBWf5mNeng.png)

Turn right for a free storage area. After storing your items, show your ticket to the staff to enter.

#### 11:00 [teamLab Borderless](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a1VeYdbgBhvPCPXC7){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*kTlH8oGRnbrMmf3L_nWSrg.jpeg)

teamLab is truly amazing, featuring various magical and creative scenes that feel unreal. The interactions include light and shadow, mirrors, spheres, pillars, leaves, mist, and more. Almost all are 360-degree immersive environments, providing a strong sense of immersion.

> *There is no map; you need to explore all the exhibition rooms on your own. If girls wear skirts and worry about exposure, aprons are thoughtfully provided at the entrance.*

> *Before entering each room, there is usually a staff member giving instructions, mostly asking not to touch anything and to walk carefully.*

> *There are restrooms inside, but you need to find the signs yourself or ask the staff.*

![](/assets/958599363857/1*rOQik1WqrSYIlOlNE8GCNg.jpeg)

The photos also look very magical.

![To have seen something, is to not have seen something else](/assets/958599363857/1*-QUcAm5LHPzXTaNqzEe-2g.png)

To have seen something is to have missed seeing something else

> *Left around 12:15, but can't guarantee everything was seen; if not for hunger, spending two to three hours inside would not be a problem.*

#### [HARBS Azabudai Hill Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GYvhb3ucV6Xykrtr9){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*H3hzyw1S7R8QJqGClj7-Kg.jpeg)

Right after visiting teamLab, there is a HARBS nearby. Let's have a fruit mille crepe cake to settle our stomach.

> [*Online menu: Click here to view.*](https://www.harbs.co.jp/zh-TW/allmenu/flag/){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*KofxiaB6kF2_MBL4_xSMJA.jpeg)

Signature Fruit Mille Crepes (Mille Crepes/ミルクレープ) 1 slice ￥1,050 + minimum one drink order.

> *Contains melon (very sweet and delicious) + banana + kiwi.*

#### 13:20 Tokyo Tower

![](/assets/958599363857/1*bxUphy3A0fYyf5koQkTQNw.jpeg)

[Visited before and went up **(please refer to the previous travelogue)**](https://zhgchg.li/posts/z-%E5%BA%A6%E6%97%85%E8%A1%8C%E9%81%8A%E8%A8%98/%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E8%A1%8C%E6%94%BB%E7%95%A5-5-%E5%A4%A9%E9%A3%9F%E4%BD%8F%E8%A1%8C%E5%85%A8%E8%A8%98%E9%8C%84%E8%88%87%E5%BF%85%E8%A8%AA%E6%99%AF%E9%BB%9E%E6%8E%A8%E8%96%A6-9da2c51fa4f2/#%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC%E9%90%B5%E5%A1%94){:target="_blank"} , this time we just passed by and took some photos.

Take the train to Harajuku.

#### 14:00 Harajuku

![](/assets/958599363857/1*6SJEx_1Xe1cRtxNtxCACUw.jpeg)

Right outside, I saw Giikawa again and again. On the upper floor of [Tokyu Plaza Omotesando Harajuku](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qo9uS7tVHoRda1MQ7){:target="_blank"}, there is [Giikawa Bakery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7rPeXTvCVEtWonMd7){:target="_blank"}.

#### [伊卡哇麵包店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7rPeXTvCVEtWonMd7){:target="_blank"} Chiikawa Bakery

![](/assets/958599363857/1*AZPe4DkecEm5YCnjvnokvA.png)

The bread and jam shop on the left requires a numbered ticket for entry; the doll shop on the right does not.

(Because I just happened to pass by, I didn’t go in)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*BAveEbCyszfKzZc3L7CE9w.jpeg)

The nearby shops have plenty of stock, but I already have sweet potatoes and can't buy more, so I just looked around without purchasing.

#### [Kiddy Land キデイランド 原宿店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JBGBKiEBNdcycYPz8){:target="_blank"}

Afterwards, I went to another nearby Kiddy Land to browse. ([But this one doesn't have Gii Kawa](https://www.kiddyland.co.jp/harajuku/){:target="_blank"})

![](/assets/958599363857/1*WTTkpsTLZ9_35_KVXD01wQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*KG4Y3IlpSLIcD-SOBxb4Ug.jpeg)

There are many IPs like Snoopy, Sanrio, Pokémon, Rilakkuma, and more.

Strolling around, it was almost 3:00 PM. I had only eaten a piece of fruit mille-feuille for lunch and was a bit hungry, so I casually picked a highly rated American burger joint I passed by to eat.

#### [14:50 The Great Burger](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xgoLanLfSSYFC5jP9){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*CxJhjOkE7NSkV2wwiZWlWA.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*0wzaWAsar2xUmujgMfHVUg.jpeg)

The specialty is wagyu mini burgers.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Anb4bgPGloM3oNkV6btS-g.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*2x_JAyGUZmJ58CSR30Rr7A.jpeg)

The taste is pretty good, but eating too much can be quite greasy.

#### 15:40 Shopping in Harajuku

After eating, continue strolling around Harajuku until evening (16:30) to go to the reserved Otter Café.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*sWQbbQUfLq3EWzMhJrvTng.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*XyVXantdzPWEZA0pYpTXKA.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*EfEP8VdYHAbuyxi2C6EFSA.jpeg)

Just wandering around, I ended up at the same Le Labo perfume shop where I bought perfume last time. In 2025, the price for 50ml perfume in Japan is ¥31,350, and after tax refund, it's about ¥28,500.

#### 16:30 [HARRY HARAJUKU terrace Otter Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WHyJ88K5hRVc4vnk9){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*b20FSUf7uuIrFFNRLP6vwQ.jpeg)

Go up the stairs beside it to the rooftop of this building.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*eoDe1nHReBDY4bv070eEBQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*x3phhvrHJ3ocidaw3glJLw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*CpEDCXiZ8Js_st4tzrXtGA.jpeg)

The venue is small, with three pools outside where three otters roam around. You can buy snacks (¥880) to feed them. (They will reach out their paws)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*U30ypE-233jdjvcR0aejGA.jpeg)

The coffee is from a vending machine that you operate yourself. (Buy for 30 minutes and get 1 cup free)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*fBpOYC967t_nalgHfuGCEg.png)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*3dL7ITdswBmvR6KUU9MQSw.jpeg)

The venue inside is not very large. In the center, there is a paid interactive otter area (additional fee required), next to it is the paid Totoro interactive area (additional fee required), and on the other side is a free hedgehog interactive area, along with several otters inside a fenced enclosure.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*L1tbx1lOqgPbpgBmEhGkVA.jpeg)

We added ¥880 per person for a 5-minute close interaction with the otters; otherwise, you can't actually touch them.

#### 17:20 [Pet the Otters](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WHyJ88K5hRVc4vnk9){:target="_blank"}

> *There were quite a few visitors interacting with the otters, and it wasn’t our turn until 17:20. The staff kept track of the time.*

You can pet him while he's eating and flipping his belly; his fur is very soft.

> ***Overall: The rating might only be around 2.5–3 stars***

> *The overall venue is too small. The basic fee is only ¥3,080 JPY per person for one hour. Besides the hedgehogs, there are no other interactive animals, and the coffee is just from a vending machine. Although the staff are gentle with the animals, the other otters resting nearby or those in the outdoor pool have very limited space to move, which feels a bit sad.*

> *It seems different from the size of a typical coffee shop and has otters running around.*

#### 18:00 Head to Shibuya

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Do_SdWdOCG8ZhXXDVcyEtg.jpeg)

#### 18:20 Queue at [Gokumiya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oZR5RprBErWbkAjq8){:target="_blank"}

It's still early, so I came to Shibuya again and started with a meal at Gokumiya.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*bA7IPZZUq2LVdCbFs9H5lw.png)

At this time, there weren't many people, so I only had to wait a short time before eating.

I ate too many hamburger steaks at lunch and felt a bit tired of them. I ordered the pure beef steak set on the left, and the juice was delicious.

> [*Last time I had the hamburger steak + beef steak set*](https://zhgchg.li/posts/z-%E5%BA%A6%E6%97%85%E8%A1%8C%E9%81%8A%E8%A8%98/%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E8%A1%8C%E6%94%BB%E7%95%A5-5-%E5%A4%A9%E9%A3%9F%E4%BD%8F%E8%A1%8C%E5%85%A8%E8%A8%98%E9%8C%84%E8%88%87%E5%BF%85%E8%A8%AA%E6%99%AF%E9%BB%9E%E6%8E%A8%E8%96%A6-9da2c51fa4f2/#%E6%B8%8B%E8%B0%B7-parco--%E6%A5%B5%E5%91%B3%E5%B1%8B){:target="*blank"} _Just remember to bring two pairs of chopsticks: metal ones for grilling and wooden ones for eating._***

**Signature — Imari Steak + Gokumiya Hamburger Beef Prices:**

- Small (120g): ¥2,480 JPY

- Medium (160g): ¥2,850 JPY

- Large (200g): ¥3,180 JPY

**Jun Imari Steak Prices:**

- Medium (130g): ¥2,480 JPY

- Large (180g): ¥3,280 JPY

**Upgrade Package:** ¥450 JPY

- Multiple Soups, Salads, and Ice Cream

- Personally, I think it's just okay.

> *The price is very affordable.*

#### Shopping and Buying Cosmetics

![](/assets/958599363857/1*mOCaZv_M3wUL_shhpsklRw.jpeg)

At the department store, I stopped by the fragrance section and bought two bottles along with a pillow spray to try at home.

After eating, we strolled around Shibuya a bit more, then went back to the hotel to buy some cosmetics at a drugstore. After returning to the hotel to rest, we got ready to say goodbye to Tokyo.

Ate too much meat, so let's just have dessert tonight!

> *Also, a colleague bought us donuts from [原宿 I’m donut? Harajuku](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ptoRy58awP8gVibR6){:target="_blank"}. (No lines in Japan compared to Taiwan)*

### Day 5 (09/17 Wed) — Ueno Station, Return Trip

#### 10:50 Leave before the final check-out time

![](/assets/958599363857/1*_fnEVTQzT63qUc3tmEtY5A.jpeg)

Goodbye Shinbashi.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*9iw9U6X2Rih37WcuoITOPw.jpeg)

Take the Yamanote Line to Ueno.

#### 11:10 Arrive at Ueno Station

![](/assets/958599363857/1*O_gvBqPHvCHYXyWu3h2sjw.jpeg)

Didn’t explore much; worried about not finding a place to store luggage, so I used the locker counter inside the station.

> *Later I found it not really worth it because you have to pick up items and pay to enter the station, plus it's expensive; the main point is that it's out of the way.*

> ***Later I found out that the Skyliner Keisei Ueno is at Ueno Station Yamashita Exit or Shinobazu Exit*** *You can reach it inside the station without going outside in the sun (but it’s easy to get lost inside); to use the lockers here, you need to walk back (about 15 minutes), and there are many coin lockers there as well.*

![](/assets/958599363857/1*stvzWK4vvJ2IxguPptM3Bg.png)

Exit here and you'll be at Ueno Zoo. Turn left, **get ready to reserve your seat for the Skyliner Keisei Ueno.**

![](/assets/958599363857/1*8sL69lXMh1Mzhs05TclHqQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*R8RkmEqHQLr_405KQIulcg.png)

Finally saw the Skyliner Keisei Ueno Station.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*9_ErGzabreeyy-qw0P8zVQ.png)

> *Since all Skyliner seats are reserved, it is recommended to book your seat early for peace of mind.*

> *The station staff can speak Chinese (I just didn't realize they were speaking Chinese at first).*

Spend the last moments strolling around Ueno.

#### [Yodobashi Ueno](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KfAz3oU7DBQpXrUc8){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*DDnDqOR4o8G6Jg60AospOg.jpeg)

There is also a second store next door.

#### [Shopping all the way to Ueno Marui Department Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/E3EfJWipQzSuC2Uv5){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*jmnShS8jUrzCbG0vej3Ksw.jpeg)

> *Opposite is another exit of Ueno Station. Ueno Station is really huge…*

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Ziu-Golfdiu6XpDVxun10g.png)

The general location is shown in the image above.

#### 12:00 Shopping at [Marui Department Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DvPAhnaEz8HYGSQs7){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/958599363857/1*GsKiVACufVHtpDYxncJ40A.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*XoxAFbNqAcwJ8YDPjQlQxw.jpeg)

There is a gacha capsule toy area on the second floor.

Got a [Shinkansen ticket capsule toy](https://www.so-ta.com/products_detail/capsuletoy/tokaido_shinkansen/){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*rysyBldMgjEOuR__7hQuOg.jpeg)

I also got hooked and bought a ReFa heart-shaped massage brush at Loft.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*sGjazwQmnuqRKWbTubIZXA.png)

Ate a croissant here to fill up.

#### 13:20 Return to Ueno Station

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Ht4JmIU70nKQWu560yEM2A.jpeg)

Also, stop by to buy Sugar Butter Tree as a souvenir.

Finally, I returned to the park exit to pick up my luggage, walked around a large loop, and then went back to Keisei Ueno.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*oR_x1HqE9qwg094sF-uygA.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*maLcXgZQHSKZdJB2CQngZg.jpeg)

The route is a bit strange; you need to go down to the platform first, then exit from another exit to reach Shinobazu.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*XLFR3n_fxsGWBK6sU5Lkhw.jpeg)

This underground passage has many coin-operated lockers, and they are mostly empty.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*TyOvYS_0FCfSujRBojgRvg.jpeg)

I couldn’t bring myself to say it, but crossing the street leads directly to the Skyliner Keisei Ueno station. (Not sure if there’s a closer exit; I didn’t wander around to avoid getting lost.)

#### 14:10 Return to Skyliner Keisei Ueno, prepare to take the train to Narita Airport

![](/assets/958599363857/1*j-oOGCBRflbJWVfkQLrA_Q.png)

#### 14:20 Departure to Narita Airport

![](/assets/958599363857/1*vV-Yxbd2JQ9acITed5qGpw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*-bEzz-shmaBClAhFkmjf8A.jpeg)

Just stopped by a convenience store on the way to grab some food and drinks to recharge.

#### 15:03 Arrive at Narita Airport Terminal 2

![](/assets/958599363857/1*6thsMc0VyilD-DBmtf85Aw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*jaAOzbQTRmETdiie_Vi7Zg.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*lpge7uQIA81oEOD9JjK3pQ.jpeg)

Follow this path all the way up to reach the international departures.

> *I originally planned to eat at [the newly opened Shake Shack burger](https://matcha-jp.com/tw/25632){:target="_blank"} in Terminal 1, but I was too tired and didn’t feel like going.*

#### 15:40 Complete check-in and baggage drop-off

![](/assets/958599363857/1*qtNeXNg2HuWhOQBd0YqnyQ.png)

> [*You can complete online check-in and seat selection 24 hours before departure, then go straight to baggage drop-off at the airport to speed up the process.*](https://digital.jal.co.jp/ssci/identification?lang=zh-tw){:target="_blank"}

After checking in my luggage, I went straight to line up for departure (exhausted).

#### 16:00 Complete security check and immigration clearance

![](/assets/958599363857/1*41hw6bw7XnkIpESE-es7iw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*XksioltS7RRgmtf4Gz-N3A.jpeg)

Walk towards the direction of smaller numbers to reach the central connecting hall, where you can find food and shopping.

#### First, go to JAPAN FOOD HALL B1 to grab something to eat

![](/assets/958599363857/1*xj-6KVdDgwx_GPgGF0bHqQ.jpeg)

#### 16:25 Snack time

![](/assets/958599363857/1*Khh3IUrvCCYk1Ccx_fiF7w.png)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*bgttA6-L8uW93zM7TpwOmw.jpeg)

> *Ordered a tempura shrimp soba with draft beer.*

> *Actual cost: 955 TWD (Airport prices are just expensive…)*

#### 16:50 Shopping at Duty-Free and Souvenir Shops

![](/assets/958599363857/1*39UCCUtGuFBVV1FEBQG-9A.png)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*UrCaiyBHekSvy0tzTbM5Gw.png)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*_ID9YTxBia4tz-CaQrGcEw.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*DubJNBeqI-tWI5amx_VbbQ.jpeg)

Narita Airport duty-free shops really have everything. Besides luxury goods, skincare products, and alcohol, there are also well-stocked souvenir stores with a wide variety of items. Prices are generally similar to or cheaper than outside. If you haven't bought enough, you can make your final purchases before boarding.

#### 17:05 Le Labo

![](/assets/958599363857/1*J2hChay4G6BPHCItaueHFA.jpeg)

Actually, without searching specifically, I unexpectedly found La Lebo at Narita Airport's [Fa-So-La DUTY FREE Cosmetics & Perfumery](https://www.fasola.jp/en/searchByBrand.aspx){:target="_blank"}. According to the official website, both Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 have it.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*9XCr-56Q5AlUCDRedP1cBA.jpeg)

> *Even more surprising is the price, **50ml — ¥25,700**, which is cheaper than the tax-refunded price of ¥28,500 within Japan.*

![](/assets/958599363857/1*ar416ZWoAliERsR_Fg1GJQ.jpeg)

Finally gave in and bought a 26–30ml bottle (airport exclusive size), actually paid NT$3,720.

#### 17:30 Head to the boarding gate and wait

![](/assets/958599363857/1*5PiE4fENJsi1dynUUL08OQ.jpeg)

Gate 67B is in a remote corner, quite far away; unfortunately, I didn’t see any vending machines selling peach water along the way.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*K8V9RnmpGnx--VJ8HTZOaw.png)

#### 17:50 Boarding, Goodbye Tokyo!

![](/assets/958599363857/1*OxCGLuV_XrFB_c-BHM10gA.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*0qZy2nb8aXRxB1fmR-uCUA.jpeg)

The aircraft model is BOEING 737–800, the same as on the way here.

#### Narita Airport was extremely crowded; originally scheduled to depart at 18:10, but ended up waiting in line until nearly 19:00 to take off

![](/assets/958599363857/1*LbcG5trqHcp_4GejuI6iDg.jpeg)

#### Japan Airlines Free In-Flight WiFi

![](/assets/958599363857/1*1sP5H5jRMsQxm02W2TG6QA.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*eZ9beWgHlSQufFt-2Mnegg.jpeg)

I accidentally discovered that the plane offers free WiFi for one hour.

![](/assets/958599363857/1*jnrR9EmlSy0PcQkKe1eOGA.jpeg)

![](/assets/958599363857/1*5CozWE6P0BhIjE6vksu9cQ.jpeg)

The airplane meal was also excellent, featuring curry pork cutlet rice and Haagen-Dazs dessert.

#### 21:07 Return to Taiwan

#### Souvenirs
