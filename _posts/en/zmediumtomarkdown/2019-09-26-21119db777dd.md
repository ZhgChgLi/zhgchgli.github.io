### Using the 'Shortcuts' Automation Feature with Mi Home on iOS ≥ 13.1

Directly use the built-in Shortcuts app on iOS ≥ 13.1 to complete automation tasks.

### Introduction

In early July this year, I purchased two smart devices: the Mi Desk Lamp Pro and the Mi LED Smart Desk Lamp. The difference is that one supports HomeKit while the other only supports Mi Home. At that time, I wrote an article titled "[First Experience with Smart Home — Apple HomeKit & Xiaomi Mi Home](../c3150cdc85dd/)," which mentioned how to achieve smart functions for leaving and arriving home without a HomePod/Apple TV/iPad, although the steps were a bit cumbersome.

This time, with iOS ≥ 13.1 (note that it was only available after 13.1), the built-in "[Shortcuts](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/%E6%8D%B7%E5%BE%91/id915249334){:target="_blank"}" app (if you can't find it, please download it from the Store) supports automation features. If you were using IFTTT or Mi Home, you no longer need to use a third-party app!

> [p.s. If you have a HomePod, Apple TV, or iPad, you don't need to read this article; you can directly set the devices as a home hub!](../c3150cdc85dd/) 

### Achieving the Effect

You will receive notifications when entering or leaving the designated area, and clicking on them will execute the shortcuts automatically.

### How to Use
#### 1. First, open the Mi Home app

![Switch to "My" -> "Smart"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*Z0Papen1int2BNH-UO5GjQ.png)

Switch to "My" -> "Smart"

> _Here, it is assumed that you have already added the devices to Mi Home._ 

![Select "Manual Execution"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*k70shMyqZ68g3TT6xQIr6Q.png)

Select "Manual Execution"

> _Here, I would like to mention why we don't directly use Mi Home's "Leave or Arrive at a Location." First, the [GPS used in mainland China has deviations](https://buzzorange.com/techorange/2019/05/09/china-map-is-wrong/){:target="_blank"} and Xiaomi has not addressed this issue. Second, it can only set locations that have landmarks on the map, and the mainland Gaode map has very few landmarks in Taiwan._

Taking "Leaving Home" mode as an example, when leaving home, I want to turn off the fan and lights, and turn on the camera.

![Return to the list and click "Add to Siri"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*J3bs38gdCu7lWM5_BF3Gxg.png)

Return to the list and click "Add to Siri."

![Click "Add to Siri" next to the smart operation you want to add](/assets/21119db777dd/1*3-StxB6DSIQ9CEvg8xxMVg.png)

Click "Add to Siri" next to the smart operation you want to add.

![Enter the command for calling Siri -> "Add to Siri"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*g0PjYwD7i-oiA3Ju9V76QQ.png)

```
Input "Call Siri command" -> "Add to Siri"

**Note this!** The command must not conflict with built-in iOS commands!
#### 2. Open the "[Siri Shortcuts](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/%E6%8D%B7%E5%BE%91/id915249334){:target="_blank"}" APP


![Switch to the "Automation" tab and click the "+" in the upper right corner](/assets/21119db777dd/1*_LPvWc3F9OKed2q93u2sQA.png)

Switch to the "Automation" tab and click the "+" in the upper right corner


> _If there is no "Automation" tab, please check if your iOS version is higher than 13.1._ 






![Select "Create Personal Automation"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*ojg-47V9xCb_kL80sCIj-g.png)

Select "Create Personal Automation"


![Choose type "Arrive" or "Leave"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*PhBHbQ57IqvvToRYfT_C5g.png)

Choose type "Arrive" or "Leave"


![Set "Location"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*V2yPBSYfv770EePQoTTJFQ.png)

Set "Location"


![Search for a location or use the current location, then tap "Done"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*i-L6rmMe0aj5D-bReIc9Nw.png)

Search for a location or use the current location, then tap "Done"


![You can set the automatic execution time range below, then tap "Next" in the upper right corner](/assets/21119db777dd/1*ZC6BZHvVtyFWyw-mfJcvXQ.png)

You can set the automatic execution time range below, then tap "Next" in the upper right corner

Since leaving home and arriving home are events that need to be detected around the clock, we will not set a time range for execution here!


![Tap "Add Action"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*-8sdXS2aUk8bd-ZOGaAfKQ.png)

Tap "Add Action"


![Select "Scripting"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*njtg1AlUWKWc3cUCrGmSEQ.png)

Tap "Done" in the upper right corner


![The newly added automation will appear on the home page!](/assets/21119db777dd/1*iO-DeUtcQtfwiMhkvpZLwA.png)

The newly added automation will appear on the home page!

**Done!**
### Actual Execution Results

When leaving or entering the set address range, the phone and Apple Watch will receive a notification to execute the shortcut, and tapping it will execute it!


> _1. There is a 100-meter error in GPS sensing range_ 
 

> _2. **The so-called "automation" is just an automatic notification for you to press execute**, it does not truly execute actions automatically in the background_ 





> [_To solve the above two pain points, you can only do what was mentioned at the beginning of the article, buy a HomePod or find an Apple TV/iPad to act as a home hub._](../c3150cdc85dd/) 




#### On iPhone:


![Execution Notification](/assets/21119db777dd/1*5zxxXEtsSqQPsJh8qoRcwA.png)

Execution Notification


![Tap to "Execute"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*E1jWgwNHDTrXR9qQmtTmeA.png)

Tap to "Execute"

**Please note, it will require unlocking the phone first.**


![Execution failure will also provide feedback!](/assets/21119db777dd/1*3UQO0R4bt-oXwglOrhXbCQ.png)

Execution failure will also provide feedback!

Sometimes, network issues with Mi Home devices may cause execution failures.
#### On Apple Watch:


![Tap to execute](/assets/21119db777dd/1*EdRki0mt6-KE2MfW5MSB4w.png)

Tap to execute

Unlike the powerful native built-in APP of IFTTT, it can also execute notifications on the watch.
(IFTTT is purely a notification, you still need to take out your phone to tap execute)
### Besides this

Using Siri to Call Actions

Since the Mi Home smart operation scenes have been added to Siri, you can also call Siri to perform actions!
