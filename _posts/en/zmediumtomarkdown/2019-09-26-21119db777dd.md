title: iOS ≥ 13.1 Shortcuts Automation｜Seamless Integration with Mi Home Smart Devices
---

### iOS ≥ 13.1 Using the "Shortcuts" Automation Feature with Mijia Smart Home

Directly Use the Built-in Shortcuts App in iOS ≥ 13.1 to Complete Automation Tasks

### Introduction

In early July this year, I bought two smart devices: the Mi Home Desk Lamp Pro and the Mi Home LED Smart Desk Lamp. The difference is that one supports HomeKit, while the other only supports Mi Home. At that time, I wrote an article titled "[Smart Home First Experience — Apple HomeKit & Xiaomi Mi Home](../c3150cdc85dd/)," which mentioned how to complete away and home modes without a HomePod, Apple TV, or iPad. The steps were a bit complicated.

This time, iOS ≥13.1 (note that automation is available only from version 13.1 onwards) built-in "[Shortcuts](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/%E6%8D%B7%E5%BE%91/id915249334){:target="_blank"}" app (if you can't find it, please download it from the Store) supports automation features; if you use IFTTT or Mi Home, you no longer need to rely on third-party apps!

> [p.s If you have a HomePod, Apple TV, or iPad, you don’t need to read this article; just set the device as a Home Hub!] (../c3150cdc85dd/)

### Achieved Results

Entering or leaving the set area will trigger a shortcut execution notification, which will run automatically when clicked.

### How to Use

#### 1. First, open the Mi Home app

![Switch to "Mine" -> "Smart"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*Z0Papen1int2BNH-UO5GjQ.png)

Switch to "Mine" -> "Smart"

> *Assuming you have already added the device to Mi Home.*

![Select "Manual Run"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*k70shMyqZ68g3TT6xQIr6Q.png)

Select "Manual Execution"

> *Here, I want to mention again why I don't directly use Mi Home's "leave or arrive at a location." First, [GPS used in mainland China has deviations](https://buzzorange.com/techorange/2019/05/09/china-map-is-wrong/){:target="_blank"}, and Xiaomi hasn't corrected this. Second, it can only set locations with landmarks on the map, but the Gaode Map in mainland China has very few landmarks in Taiwan.*

![Dropdown the "Smart Devices" section, add the device and action to operate](/assets/21119db777dd/1*IPg5D4G7N514em_kfWuc5w.png)

Scroll down to the "Smart Devices" section, add the device and action to be performed.

![Click "Continue Adding" to include all devices to be operated](/assets/21119db777dd/1*wQOvC90cSr2iswe_80qHxw.png)

Click "Continue Adding" to include all devices to be operated.

![](/assets/21119db777dd/1*NkJcbWEBZACxpdVT7plPDQ.png)

For example, in the "Away from Home" mode, I want to turn off the fan and lights; turn on the camera when leaving home.

![Click the top right "Save" and enter the name of this smart action](/assets/21119db777dd/1*7NJfN3nJ_YjDVDfg1eOkiA.png)

Click the "Save" button at the top right and enter the name for this smart action

![Back to list, click "Add to Siri"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*J3bs38gdCu7lWM5_BF3Gxg.png)

Back to the list, tap "Add to Siri"

![Click "Add to Siri" next to the smart action you want to add](/assets/21119db777dd/1*3-StxB6DSIQ9CEvg8xxMVg.png)

Click "Add to Siri" next to the smart action you want to add

![Enter "Call Siri command" -> "Add to Siri"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*g0PjYwD7i-oiA3Ju9V76QQ.png)

Type "Call Siri command" -> "Add to Siri"

**Important!** Commands must not conflict with built-in iOS commands!

#### 2. Open the 「 [Siri Shortcuts](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/%E6%8D%B7%E5%BE%91/id915249334){:target="_blank"} 」 APP

![Switch to the "Automation" tab, click the "+" at the top right](/assets/21119db777dd/1*_LPvWc3F9OKed2q93u2sQA.png)

Switch to the "Automation" tab and click the "+" button at the top right corner.

> *If the "Automation" tab is missing, please check if your iOS version is above 13.1.*

![Select "Create Personal Automation"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*ojg-47V9xCb_kL80sCIj-g.png)

Choose "Create Personal Automation"

![Select type "Arrival" or "Departure"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*PhBHbQ57IqvvToRYfT_C5g.png)

Select type "Arrival" or "Departure"

![Set "Location"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*V2yPBSYfv770EePQoTTJFQ.png)

Set "Location"

![Search location or use current location, then tap "Done"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*i-L6rmMe0aj5D-bReIc9Nw.png)

Search for a location or use the current location, then tap "Done"

![You can set the automatic execution time range below, then click "Next" at the top right](/assets/21119db777dd/1*ZC6BZHvVtyFWyw-mfJcvXQ.png)

Below, you can set the automatic execution time range. Click "Next" at the top right corner.

Because leaving and arriving home are events that need to be detected around the clock, no execution time range will be set here!

![Click "Add Action"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*-8sdXS2aUk8bd-ZOGaAfKQ.png)

Click "Add Action"

![Select "Process Instructions"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*njtg1AlUWKWc3cUCrGmSEQ.png)

Select "Process Instruction"

![Scroll to the "Shortcuts" section and select "Run Shortcut"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*seDM3PVZQfQsjHpOjecQuQ.png)

Scroll to the "Shortcuts" section and select "Run Shortcut"

![Click the "Shortcuts" section](/assets/21119db777dd/1*gXm4pRJbryAtQkuwd9dc_Q.png)

Click the "Shortcuts" section

![Find the "Command to Call Siri" just set in Mijia's "Add to Siri" settings, and select it](/assets/21119db777dd/1*gosnwKrxnR77BX4z9IMTUQ.png)

Find the "Siri Command When Calling Siri" that you just set in Mi Home under "Add to Siri," and select it.

![Tap the top right corner "Done"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*1Ab0t-A6H9GoB3FaLuetvQ.png)

Tap "Done" at the top right corner

![The newly added automation will appear right on the homepage!](/assets/21119db777dd/1*iO-DeUtcQtfwiMhkvpZLwA.png)

The newly added automation will appear right on the homepage!

**Done!**

### Actual Execution Result

When leaving or entering the set address range, your iPhone and Apple Watch will receive a notification to run the shortcut. Tap it to execute!

> *1. GPS sensing range has an error margin of 100 meters*

> *2. **"Automation" here only means automatically notifying you to execute**, not truly running actions automatically in the background*

> [*To solve the above two issues, you can only use what was mentioned at the beginning of the article: buy a HomePod or use an Apple TV/iPad as the home hub.*](../c3150cdc85dd/)

#### On iPhone:

![Execution Notification](/assets/21119db777dd/1*5zxxXEtsSqQPsJh8qoRcwA.png)

Execution Notification

![Click to "Run"](/assets/21119db777dd/1*E1jWgwNHDTrXR9qQmtTmeA.png)

Click to "Execute"

**Please note, unlocking the phone will be required first.**

![Execution failure will also provide feedback!](/assets/21119db777dd/1*3UQO0R4bt-oXwglOrhXbCQ.png)

Failures will also provide feedback!

Sometimes, Mi Home devices fail to execute due to network issues.

#### On Apple Watch:

![Click to execute](/assets/21119db777dd/1*EdRki0mt6-KE2MfW5MSB4w.png)

Click to execute

Unlike IFTTT's native apps, its strength lies in the ability to execute actions directly from watch notifications.  
(IFTTT only sends notifications, and you still need to take out your phone to tap and execute)

### Besides that

![Using Siri to Call and Execute](/assets/21119db777dd/1*KjRJQutJbRD3aPQUw7LeUQ.png)

Using Siri to Trigger Execution

Since the Mi Home smart operation scenes have been added to Siri, you can now use Siri to execute actions!
