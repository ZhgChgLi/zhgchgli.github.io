### ZReviewsBot — Slack App Review Notification Bot

Free and open-source iOS & Android APP latest review tracking Slack Bot

### TL;DR \[2022/08/10\] Update:

The App Reviews Bot has been redesigned using the new [App Store Connect API](../f1365e51902c/) and has been rebranded as “[ZReviewTender — Free and Open-source App Reviews Monitoring Bot](../e36e48bb9265/)”.

[ZReviewsBot](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewsBot){:target="_blank"}

[ZReviewsBot](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewsBot){:target="_blank"} is a free, open-source project that helps your App team automatically track the latest reviews of your App on the App Store (iOS) and Google Play (Android) platforms, sending them to a designated Slack Channel for you to stay updated on the current status of the App.
- ✅ Uses updated, more reliable API Endpoint to track iOS App reviews \( [Technical Details](../cb0c68c33994/) \)
- ✅ Supports dual-platform review tracking for iOS & Android
- ✅ Supports keyword notification skip feature \(to prevent spam from ads\)
- ✅ Customizable settings, as you wish
- ✅ Supports deploying scheduled bots using GitHub Action

### \[2022/07/20 Update\]

[App Store Connect API now supports reading and managing Customer Reviews](../f1365e51902c/), and this bot will implement it in future updates, replacing the method of using Fastlane — Spaceship to fetch reviews from the backend.
### Origin

Following the previous article “[AppStore APP’s Reviews Slack Bot Insights](../cb0c68c33994/)”, I researched and completed a new iOS review fetching tool, and thought it would be quite suitable to release it as a Side Project Open Source for friends facing the same issue.
