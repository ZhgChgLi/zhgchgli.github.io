A free and open-source Slack bot for tracking the latest reviews of iOS and Android apps.

The App Reviews Bot has been redesigned using the new [App Store Connect API](../f1365e51902c/) and has been rebranded as [ZReviewTender — a free and open-source App Reviews monitoring bot](../e36e48bb9265/).

[ZReviewsBot](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewsBot){:target="_blank"}

[ZReviewsBot](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewsBot){:target="_blank"} is a free and open-source project that helps your app team automatically track the latest reviews of your app on the App Store (iOS) and Google Play (Android) platforms, sending updates to a designated Slack channel so you can stay informed about your app's current status.
- ✅ Uses updated and more reliable API endpoints to track iOS app reviews ( [Technical Details](../cb0c68c33994/) )
- ✅ Supports dual-platform review tracking for iOS & Android
- ✅ Includes keyword notification filtering to avoid spam
- ✅ Customizable settings to suit your needs
- ✅ Supports deployment of scheduled bots using GitHub Actions

### [2022/07/20 Update]

The [App Store Connect API now supports reading and managing Customer Reviews](../f1365e51902c/), and this bot will implement this in future updates, replacing the previous method of using Fastlane — Spaceship to fetch reviews from the backend.
### Origin

Following the previous article "[AppStore APP’s Reviews Slack Bot Insights](../cb0c68c33994/)," I developed a new tool for fetching iOS reviews and thought it would be a great idea to release it as an open-source side project for others facing similar challenges.
