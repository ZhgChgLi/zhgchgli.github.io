The App Reviews Bot has been redesigned using the new [App Store Connect API](../f1365e51902c/) and relaunched as "[ZReviewTender — Free and Open Source App Reviews Monitoring Bot](../e36e48bb9265/)".

[ZReviewsBot](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewsBot){:target="_blank"}

[ZReviewsBot](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewsBot){:target="_blank"} is a free, open-source project that helps your app team automatically track the latest reviews on the App Store (iOS) and Google Play (Android) platforms, sending them to a designated Slack channel for real-time updates on your app’s status.

- ✅ Use updated, more reliable API Endpoints to track iOS App reviews ([Technical Details](../cb0c68c33994/))

- ✅ Supports dual-platform review tracking for iOS & Android

- ✅ Supports keyword notification skip feature (to prevent spam advertisement harassment)

- ✅ Customizable settings, as you wish

- ✅ Supports deploying scheduled automation bots using Github Action

### [2022/07/20 Update]

[App Store Connect API now supports reading and managing Customer Reviews](../f1365e51902c/). This bot will be updated later to implement this, replacing the method of using Fastlane — Spaceship to fetch reviews from the backend.

### Origin

Following the previous article "[AppStore APP’s Reviews Slack Bot 那些事](../cb0c68c33994/)," I researched and completed a new iOS review fetching tool. I thought it would be suitable as a side project to open source for others facing the same issue.
