### \[Quick Start\! \] Deploy Your App Store Review Monitoring Bot for Free with Github Action x ZReviewTender

In just three simple steps, you can create a free, stable, and secure App review bot that keeps you updated on the latest user reviews.

![[ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"}](/assets/0095528cf875/1*k8RswW3es9L19jIgbRDLpQ.png)

- [**\[English Version\]** : \[Quick Start\! \] Github Action x ZReviewTender Free and Fast Deployment of Your App Store Review Monitoring Bot](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender/blob/main/quickstart.md){:target="_blank"}

### [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"}

[![](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/516425682/1cc1a829-d87d-4d4a-925b-60471b912b23)](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"}

ZReviewTender is an open-source App review bot I created in August 2022. It automatically fetches user reviews from the iOS App Store and Android Google Play Store and forwards them to a specified Slack channel.

Additionally, you can set review fetching rules, integrate with Google Translate, Asana, Google Sheets, and customize operations.

### [Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions){:target="_blank"}

Github Action is a CI/CD automation integration tool provided by Github. You can use your own machine as a server (Github Runner) or directly use the machines provided by Github to run CI/CD and automation scripts.

#### Costs and Limitations
- Using your own machine (Github Runner):
[No special costs, only limits on maximum execution counts, concurrency limits, and some API short-term maximum request limits.](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#usage-limits){:target="_blank"}
- [Using Github's provided machines:](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#included-storage-and-minutes){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*QyhxZ98B20NV18-W5vKJDg.png)

GitHub Free provides a basic 500 MB Storage (for CI/CD Artifacts) and 2,000 minutes of execution time per month.

[**Please note due to machine cost issues:**](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#minute-multipliers){:target="_blank"}
- If using Github's Windows machines, the consumed minutes equal actual minutes x 2.
- If using Github's macOS machines, the consumed minutes equal actual minutes x 10.

For detailed pricing calculations, please refer to the [official pricing calculator](https://github.com/pricing/calculator?feature=actions){:target="_blank"}.

> [**_ZReviewTender_**](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} **_Estimated monthly minutes consumed: about 120 minutes_**

> _It only needs to run on a basic pricing Linux machine, consuming about ≤ 1 minute per execution. By default, it runs every 6 hours, spending 4 minutes a day, totaling about 120 minutes a month, which is well within the free quota._

> [**_ZReviewTender_**](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} **_Storage consumption: 0_**

> _No artifacts are stored, so there are no storage costs._

### [Slack](https://slack.com/){:target="_blank"}

The internal communication tool used by the company. A Slack App will be created to forward App Store review notifications to a specified channel.

### [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} x [Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions){:target="_blank"} x [Slack](https://slack.com/){:target="_blank"}

> _We use Github Action to execute the ZReviewTender script and forward the results to Slack. The Github Repo (Action) is just a carrier, so even if your main project is not hosted on Github, you can still easily complete the ZReviewTender deployment by following the steps below. 🎉🎉🎉_

> **_I have successfully deployed it for 5 different companies' apps and it has been running stably and for free for over 2 years._**

#### Advantages:
- **Free**: [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} is an open-source free service I created, deployed on [Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions){:target="_blank"} with ample free quota. You won't need to spend money each month on subscription-based App Review Bot services.
- **Secure**: The credentials and keys used to fetch reviews are securely stored in your Github Private Repo, and no one else has access. You won't have to risk leaking important credentials and keys by uploading them to third-party services; [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} is an open-source project, and all operations can be publicly reviewed.
- **Reliable**: [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} uses the latest official API to fetch review information, making it more accurate and stable compared to other services that rely on RSS to fetch reviews.

[https://www\.buymeacoffee\.com/zhgchgli](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/zhgchgli){:target="_blank"}

> [**_If this project has helped you, feel free to buy me a coffee. Thank you!_**](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/zhgchgli){:target="_blank"}

### Quick Start! 🚀

> **_The entire setup process takes about 30 minutes, but you only need to set it up once. Unless the credentials change, it can run permanently for free and stably._** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

#### Step 1. Create a Slack App

If your organization already has a Slack App with permissions like `chat:write`, you can reuse it without creating a new one.

[**Go to Slack Apps homepage:**](https://api.slack.com/apps){:target="_blank"}

![[https://api\.slack\.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps){:target="_blank"}](/assets/0095528cf875/1*JDaxmORRL3ipdeA0ZaHW3w.png)

[https://api\.slack\.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps){:target="_blank"}

Click "Create New App" in the top right corner.

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*sFxmX9qty4UEgMhiTglEfA.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*XiqfLoEmITHyF9E-rDPjPQ.png)

1. Choose: From scratch
2. Enter App Name: `ZReviewTender` or a custom Slack App name
3. Select the target Slack Workspace: Make sure you choose a Workspace where you have permission to add a Slack App.
4. Create App

**Add OAuth & Permissions Scopes:** 
After creating the Slack app, go to the "OAuth & Permissions" tab to set the Scopes.

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*VjXVtAkVN8PLtCAOHocAmA.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*WSNd89bJuG1xCIPM9SsLnA.png)

1. Select "OAuth & Permissions"
2. Scroll down to find the Scopes Section
3. Sequentially add the three required Scopes for the ZReviewTender Slack App:

```vbnet
chat:write
chat:write.public
links:write
```

**Install App** 
Return to the Install App tab to install the Slack App to your Workspace.

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*qItvJK5tZ-i8vE5bNUZIKQ.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*Eevu3Sir68DhfFSrFKb1xg.png)

1. Select "Install App"
2. Click "Install to _YOUR_WORKSPACE_"
3. Click "Allow"

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*lj8KZ5bEOG9urPgtxet-YA.png)

After installation, return to the Install App page where you will see the `Slack App Bot User OAuth Token`. Click "Copy" to copy it. **Make a note of it for later use.**

**Create a channel to receive review notifications:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*vwILile0Y52PgjQAYLqGjQ.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*jZwuovjXaCbQiWTixOP5Dg.png)

- Sidebar -> Channels -> Create -> Create channel
- Name: Enter your desired channel name

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*cK8ihh9IQPacTjGKG4GS3Q.png)

**Visibility:**
- Public: Open to everyone, no further action needed.
- **Private: Private channel,** ⭐️⭐️⭐️ **you need to add the Slack App you just created:**

**How to add the Slack App to the channel:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*AgCjAYb94XOmlIJ7VV6gaw.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*GVqrJlBg_9MjVyGitA2g-A.png)

1. Click on the channel name at the top
2. Click "Settings"
3. Click "Add an App"

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*KU5hdi2m46TUwZbjI-xKmg.png)

1. Search for the name of the Slack App you just created
2. Click "Add"

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*Qx2XPK8lspCrSauWE4IhXA.png)

Once added successfully, the channel will display a message: `ZReviewTender joined.`

> **_⭐️⭐️⭐️ I noticed a Slack bug here; the Slack App may not be searchable immediately after creation. It may take some time to appear; you can use a Public Channel in the meantime, which does not require adding the Slack App._**

**Obtain Channel ID:** 
The last and most important step is to obtain the Channel ID for later configuration.

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*CmQtV9QibdOb8zHuiYJS2Q.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*VNmLOs0mBhF6qisDzx6Zcw.png)

1. Click on the channel name at the top
2. At the bottom of the About section, you will find the Channel ID information
3. **Make a note of the `Channel ID` for later use**

> **_Slack steps completed._**

— — —

**Additional Notes:**

**You can edit the Slack App name and icon in "Basic Information" -> "Display Information":**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*5THTrkeWXYa5QaGCNCmzhQ.png)

After making changes, remember to click "Save Changes" in the bottom right corner to save.

**If you add new OAuth & Permissions Scopes, you need to click "reinstall your app" for the changes to take effect:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*pUdxf_G1uoHcq22VGjHOzw.png)

#### Step 2. Generate Apple App Store Connect API & Google Play Android Developer API Credentials
#### Apple App Store Connect API Credentials

**iOS is relatively easier; we just need to obtain the following four pieces of information from App Store Connect:**

**Issuer ID:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/0*eHn-LMnUlS-04d70.png)

- App Store Connect -> Keys -> [App Store Connect API](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/api){:target="_blank"}
- **Make a note of the `Issuer ID` for later use.**

**Private Key ID & Private Key:**

Click the "+" button to add:

![](/assets/0095528cf875/0*MI0-cA0BTkq5XqkT.png)

- Name: `ZReviewTender`
- Access: `App Manager`

![](/assets/0095528cf875/0*V0U2HjKTRfL8dl1j.png)

- `Key ID` **Make a note of it for later use.**
- **Click "Download API Key" to save the downloaded file named `AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8` for later use.**

**App ID: (the target App ID for fetching reviews)**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*zCgRRm0-nDwvcGOv26Aprw.png)

You can find the App ID in [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps){:target="_blank"} -> App Store -> General -> App Information -> `App ID`.
- **Make a note of the `App ID` for later use.**

#### Google Play Android Developer API Credentials

Android is more complex; you need to enable the API from the Google Cloud Project associated with the App, create a Service Account, and grant the Service Account access to the Google Play Console with permissions for the target App.

[**Go to Google Cloud Project:**](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome){:target="_blank"}

Select the Google Cloud Project associated with the App or create a new Project.

**Enable "Android Developer API":**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*zvWFDBuPRq9a6bizjqrx4Q.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*Z0g1ezVJBptHvRkd1VlF_Q.png)

1. Search for "Android Developer API" and click to enter
2. Select "Enable"

**\[Optional Step\] You can also enable "Cloud Translation API":**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*9CItyqjGmG5LcMMDe-6NlQ.png)

- Enabling this allows you to use the same Service Account credentials for automatic review translation.
- **Please note: The Cloud Translation API is not free; detecting languages and translations will incur costs!**
- **Please note: The Cloud Translation API is not free; detecting languages and translations will incur costs!**
- **Please note: The Cloud Translation API is not free; detecting languages and translations will incur costs!**

1. Select "Service Accounts"
2. Choose "Create Service Account"

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*_oU-8T-qv7pyuUBmX-U64w.png)

1. Service Account Name: Enter a name, you can use " `ZReviewTender` " or " `Google Play Review Bot` "
2. Service Account ID: This will auto-fill; no need to change unless necessary, this will also be your Service Account Email.
3. Click "Done"

**Make a note of this Service Account's email address:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*gTNjATgSPZ4Z9zrJ2caYdw.png)

- The list page will also display the Service Account Email address.
- **Make a note of the `Service Account Email` for later use.**

**Create a Service Account Key Credential:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*MDkammdsXQQbLYrQ_eGTxQ.png)

1. Refresh the list page and click on the Service Account you just created.
2. Click "Add Key"
3. Select "Create new key"
4. Choose "JSON" as the key type.
5. Click "Create"
6. **Save the downloaded file named `XXXX-XXXX.json` for later use.**

**Add the Service Account to Google Play Console and grant permissions for the target App:**

[**Go to Google Play Console:**](https://play.google.com/console/){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*Lbowza_thZaSDx5BuRWMsg.png)

1. Click "Users and permissions"
2. Click "Invite new users" on the right

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*vNreKooCJL4XiRv_XTsAYg.png)

1. Enter the `Service Account Email` you noted earlier in the Email address field.
2. Under App permissions -> Add app
3. Add the target App for fetching reviews.
4. Click "Invite user" to complete the invitation without verification.

**Obtain Google Play Console Developer ID, App ID, and Package Name information:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*-eha5rTUbdzUwJfiJTakBA.png)

1. Click on the target App to enter the Dashboard.
2. **Make a note of the `Package Name` for later use.**

Copy the Dashboard URL and find:

3. The `/developers/` `XXX` **is your `Developer ID`. Make a note of this Developer ID for later use.**

4. In the /app/ `XXX`, **this is your `App ID`. Make sure to note down this App ID, as you'll need it for the setup later.**

> **_Credential setup completed._**

#### Step 3. Deploying with Github Action and Filling in Configuration Files

### Additional Settings
#### Add Filtering Functionality

Only forward reviews that meet certain criteria.
```yaml
    - FilterProcessor:
        class: "FilterProcessor"
        enable: true # enable
        keywordsInclude: [] # keywords you want to filter out
        ratingsInclude: [] # ratings you want to filter out
        territoriesInclude: [] # territories you want to filter out (territory for Apple e.g. TWN)
```
- You just need to add the `FilterProcessor` settings in the `processors` section of either `/config/apple.yml` or `/config/android.yml`.

#### Add Automatic Translation Functionality

Automatically translate reviews in languages other than yours using the Google Cloud Translation API (this incurs costs).
- **Make sure that the GCP Project associated with the Service Account created in Step 2 has the "Cloud Translation API" enabled.**
- The settings for `apple.yml` and `android.yml` differ slightly.

`apple.yml:`
```bash
    - GoogleTranslateProcessor: # Google Translate Processor, will translate review text to your language, you can remove the whole block if you don't need it.
        class: "GoogleTranslateProcessor"
        enable: true # enable
        googleTranslateAPIKeyFilePath: './config/XXXX-XXXX.json' # Google Translate API Service Account Credential .json File Path
        googleTranslateTargetLang: 'zh-TW' # Translate to what Language
        googleTranslateTerritoriesExclude: ["TWN","CHN"] # Review origin Territory that you don't want to translate. (territory for Apple e.g. TWN)
```
- `./config/XXXX-XXXX.json` (the filename of the `XXXX-XXXX.json` Service Account key file saved in Step 2).

`android.yml:`
```bash
    - GoogleTranslateProcessor: # Google Translate Processor, will translate review text to your language, you can remove the whole block if you don't need it.
        class: "GoogleTranslateProcessor"
        enable: true # enable
        googleTranslateAPIKeyFilePath: './config/XXXX-XXXX.json' # Google Translate API Service Account Credential .json File Path
        googleTranslateTargetLang: 'zh-TW' # Translate to what Language
        googleTranslateTerritoriesExclude: ["zh-Hant","zh-Hans"] # Review origin Territory (language) that you don't want to translate. (language for android e.g. zh-Hant, en)
```
- `./config/XXXX-XXXX.json` (the filename of the `XXXX-XXXX.json` Service Account key file saved in Step 2).

**Complete Combination Example:**
```yaml
platform: 'android'

        googleTranslateTerritoriesExclude: ["zh-Hant","zh-Hans"] # Review origin Territory (language) that you don't want to translate. (language for android e.g. zh-Hant, en)
    - SlackProcessor: # Slack Processor, resend App Review to Slack.
        class: "SlackProcessor"
        enable: true # enable
        slackTimeZoneOffset: "+08:00" # Review Created Date TimeZone
        slackAttachmentGroupByNumber: "1" # 1~100, how many review messages in 1 slack message.
        slackBotToken: "" # Slack Bot Token, send slack messages through Slack Bot.
        slackBotTargetChannel: "" # Slack Bot Token, send slack messages through Slack Bot. (recommended, first priority)
