### [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"}


[![](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/516425682/1cc1a829-d87d-4d4a-925b-60471b912b23)](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"}


ZReviewTender — is an open-source App Store review bot that I created in August 2022. Its function is to automatically fetch user reviews from the iOS App Store and Android Google Play Store and forward them to a specified Slack Channel.

Additionally, it allows you to specify review fetching rules, integrate with Google Translate, Asana, Google Sheets, and supports custom operations.
### [Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions){:target="_blank"}

Github Action is a CI/CD automation integration tool provided by Github. We can use our own machines as servers (Github Runner) or directly use machines provided by Github to execute CI/CD and automation scripts.
#### Costs and Limitations
- Using your own machine (Github Runner):
[No special costs, only limits on maximum execution numbers, concurrency limits, and some API short-term maximum request limits.](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#usage-limits){:target="_blank"}
- [Using machines provided by Github:](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#included-storage-and-minutes){:target="_blank"}



![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*QyhxZ98B20NV18-W5vKJDg.png)

GitHub Free provides basic 500 MB Storage (for CI/CD Artifact) and 2,000 Minutes of execution time per month.

[**It is important to note that due to machine cost issues:**](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#minute-multipliers){:target="_blank"}
- If using GitHub's Windows machines, the consumed minutes equal actual minutes x 2
- If using GitHub's macOS machines, the consumed minutes equal actual minutes x 10

For detailed pricing calculations, please refer to the [official pricing calculator](https://github.com/pricing/calculator?feature=actions){:target="_blank"}.

> [**_ZReviewTender_**](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} **_Minutes per month consumption: approximately 120 minutes_**

> _It only needs to run on a basic pricing Linux, consuming about ≤ 1 minute per execution, scheduled to run every 6 hours, resulting in a daily cost of 4 minutes, totaling about 120 minutes per month, which is well within the free quota._

> [**_ZReviewTender_**](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} **_Storage consumption: 0_**

> _No Artifact storage data is used, so there are no storage costs._

### [Slack](https://slack.com/){:target="_blank"}

The internal communication software used by the company will create a Slack App and forward app store review notifications to a designated channel through this Slack App identity.

### [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} x [Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions){:target="_blank"} x [Slack](https://slack.com/){:target="_blank"}

> _We use GitHub Action to execute the ZReviewTender script to forward results to Slack. The GitHub Repo (Action) is just used as a carrier, so even if your main project does not use GitHub hosting, you can still easily complete the ZReviewTender deployment by following the steps below. 🎉🎉🎉_

> **_I have successfully deployed it on different apps of 5 different companies and it has been running stably and for free for at least 2 years._**

#### Advantages:
- **Free**: [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} is an open-source free service I created, deployed on [Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions){:target="_blank"} with ample free quota. You do not need to spend money every month on subscription services for App Review Bots.
- **Secure**: The credentials and keys used to fetch reviews are securely stored in your GitHub Private Repo, and no one else has access besides you. You do not need to risk leaking important credentials and keys by uploading them to third-party services; [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} is an open-source project, and all operations can withstand public scrutiny.
- **Reliable**: [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} uses the latest official API to fetch review information, which is more accurate and stable compared to other services that use RSS to fetch reviews.

> [**_If this project has been helpful to you, feel free to buy me a coffee. Thank you._**](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/zhgchgli){:target="_blank"} 

### Quick Start!🚀

> **_The entire setup process takes about 30 minutes, but it only needs to be set up once. Unless the credential key changes, it can operate permanently for free and stably._** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 

#### Step 1. Create a Slack App

If your organization already has a Slack App with permissions like `chat:write`, you can reuse it without creating a new one.

[**Go to Slack Apps homepage:**](https://api.slack.com/apps){:target="_blank"}

![[https://api\.slack\.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps){:target="_blank"}](/assets/0095528cf875/1*JDaxmORRL3ipdeA0ZaHW3w.png)

[https://api\.slack\.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps){:target="_blank"}

Click "Create New App" in the upper right corner.

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*sFxmX9qty4UEgMhiTglEfA.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*XiqfLoEmITHyF9E-rDPjPQ.png)

1. Choose: From scratch
2. Enter App Name: `ZReviewTender` or a custom Slack App name
3. Select the target Slack Workspace for installation: Please confirm that you have permission to add a Slack App to the chosen Workspace.
4. Create App

**Add OAuth & Permissions Scopes:** 
After creating the Slack app, go to the "OAuth & Permissions" tab to set up Scopes.

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*VjXVtAkVN8PLtCAOHocAmA.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*WSNd89bJuG1xCIPM9SsLnA.png)

1. Select "OAuth & Permissions"
2. Scroll down to find the Scopes Section
3. Sequentially enter the three essential Scopes for the ZReviewTender Slack App:

```vbnet
chat:write
chat:write.public
links:write
```

**Install App** 
Return to the Install App tab to install the Slack App to the Workspace.

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*qItvJK5tZ-i8vE5bNUZIKQ.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*Eevu3Sir68DhfFSrFKb1xg.png)

1. Select "Install App"
2. Click "Install to _YOUR\_WORKSPACE_"
3. Click "Allow"

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*lj8KZ5bEOG9urPgtxet-YA.png)

After installation, return to the Install App page where you will see the `Slack App Bot User OAuth Token`. Click "Copy" to copy it, **make a note of it for later use**.

**Create a channel to receive review notifications:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*vwILile0Y52PgjQAYLqGjQ.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*jZwuovjXaCbQiWTixOP5Dg.png)

- Sidebar -> Channels -> Create -> Create channel
- Name: Enter the desired channel name

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*cK8ihh9IQPacTjGKG4GS3Q.png)

**Visibility:**
- Public: Open to everyone, no further action needed.
- **Private: Private channel,** ⭐️⭐️⭐️ **needs to add the Slack App just created:**
```

```markdown
**How to Join a Channel in Slack App:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*AgCjAYb94XOmlIJ7VV6gaw.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*GVqrJlBg_9MjVyGitA2g-A.png)

1. Click on the \#channel name at the top
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Click on "Add an App"

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*KU5hdi2m46TUwZbjI-xKmg.png)

1. Search for the name of the Slack App you just created
2. Click "Add"

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*Qx2XPK8lspCrSauWE4IhXA.png)

A successful join will show a confirmation message. `ZReviewTender joined.`

> **_⭐️⭐️⭐️ A Slack bug has been discovered here; the Slack App may not be searchable immediately after creation and may take some time to appear. You can use a Public Channel first, as it does not require adding the Slack App to use._**

**Obtain Channel ID:**
The last and most important step is to obtain the Channel ID for later configuration.

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*CmQtV9QibdOb8zHuiYJS2Q.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*VNmLOs0mBhF6qisDzx6Zcw.png)

1. Click on the \#channel name at the top
2. At the bottom of About, there is a Channel ID information
3. **Note down the `Channel ID` for later configuration**

> **_Slack steps completed._**

— — —

**Additional Notes:**

**You can edit the Slack App name and icon in "Basic Information" -> "Display Information":**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*5THTrkeWXYa5QaGCNCmzhQ.png)

After making changes, remember to click "Save Changes" at the bottom right to save.

**If there are new OAuth & Permissions Scopes, you need to click "reinstall your app" for the changes to take effect:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*pUdxf_G1uoHcq22VGjHOzw.png)

#### Step 2. Generate Apple App Store Connect API & Google Play Android Developer API Credentials
#### Apple App Store Connect API Credentials

**iOS is relatively easier; we only need to obtain the following four pieces of information from App Store Connect:**

**Issuer ID:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/0*eHn-LMnUlS-04d70.png)

- App Store Connect -> Keys -> [App Store Connect API](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/api){:target="_blank"}
- **Note down the `Issuer ID` for later configuration**

**Private Key ID & Private Key:**

Click the "+" button to add:

![](/assets/0095528cf875/0*MI0-cA0BTkq5XqkT.png)

- Name: `ZReviewTender`
- Access: `App Manager`

![](/assets/0095528cf875/0*V0U2HjKTRfL8dl1j.png)

- `Key ID` **for later configuration**
- **Click "Download API Key" to save the downloaded file " `AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8` " for later configuration.**

**App ID: (Target App ID for fetching reviews)**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*zCgRRm0-nDwvcGOv26Aprw.png)

The App ID can be found in [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps){:target="_blank"} -> App Store -> General -> App Information -> `App ID`.
- **Note down the `App ID` for later configuration**
```

#### Google Play Android Developer API Credentials

Android is relatively complex; you need to first enable the API from the Google Cloud Project associated with your app, create a Service Account, and add the Service Account to the Google Play Console, granting it permissions for the app.

[**Go to Google Cloud Project:**](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome){:target="_blank"}

Select the Google Cloud Project associated with your app or create a new project.

**Enable "Android Developer API":**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*zvWFDBuPRq9a6bizjqrx4Q.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*Z0g1ezVJBptHvRkd1VlF_Q.png)

1. Search for "Android Developer API" and click to enter.
2. Select "Enable".

**\[This step is optional\] You can also enable the "Cloud Translation API" at the same time:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*9CItyqjGmG5LcMMDe-6NlQ.png)

- After enabling, you can use the same Service Account credentials to integrate the automatic translation feature for reviews.
- **Please note: The Cloud Translation API is not free; detecting languages and translations will incur costs!**
- **Please note: The Cloud Translation API is not free; detecting languages and translations will incur costs!**
- **Please note: The Cloud Translation API is not free; detecting languages and translations will incur costs!**

1. Select "Service Accounts".
2. Choose "Create Service Account".

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*_oU-8T-qv7pyuUBmX-U64w.png)

1. Service Account Name: Enter your own, you can input " `ZReviewTender` " or " `Google Play Review Bot` ".
2. Service Account ID: Automatically filled in, no need to change unless necessary; this will also be your Service Account Email.
3. Click "Done".

**Note down this Service Account's email address:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*gTNjATgSPZ4Z9zrJ2caYdw.png)

- The list page will also display the Service Account Email address.
- **Note down the `Service Account Email`, as you will need it later.**

**Create a Service Account Key Credential:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*MDkammdsXQQbLYrQ_eGTxQ.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*Ev2pRLcJv_UGKUWfDNsSPQ.png)

1. Refresh the list page and click on the Service Account you just created.
2. Click "Add Key".
3. Click "Create new key".
4. Select "JSON" as the key type.
5. Click "Create".
6. **Save the downloaded " `XXXX-XXXX.json` " file for later use.**

**Add the Service Account to Google Play Console and grant it permissions for the target app to fetch reviews:**

[**Access the Google Play Console backend:**](https://play.google.com/console/){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*Lbowza_thZaSDx5BuRWMsg.png)

1. Click "Users and permissions".
2. Click "Invite new users" on the right. 

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*vNreKooCJL4XiRv_XTsAYg.png)

```markdown
1. Enter the `Service Account Email` that you just noted down.
2. App permissions -> Add app
3. Add the target app from which you want to fetch reviews.
4. Click "Invite user" to complete the invitation without verification.


**Obtain Google Play Console Developer ID & App ID & Package Name Information:**


![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*-eha5rTUbdzUwJfiJTakBA.png)

1. Click on the target app to enter the Dashboard.
2. **Note down the `Package Name`, which will be used later.**


Copy the Dashboard URL and find:

3. Among them, /developers/ `XXX` **is your `Developer ID`. Note down this Developer ID number for later use.**

4. Among them, /app/ `XXX` **is your `App ID`. Note down this App ID number for later use.**


> **_Credential setup is complete._** 




#### Step 3. Github Action Deployment and Configuration File Filling

The exciting news is that I have packaged the tedious Github Repo and Github Action setup process into a Repo Template & Marketplace Github Action. You can complete the work by following these few steps.

### Other Settings
#### Add Filtering Functionality

Only forward reviews that meet the criteria.
```yaml
    - FilterProcessor:
        class: "FilterProcessor"
        enable: true # enable
        keywordsInclude: [] # keywords you want to filter out
        ratingsInclude: [] # ratings you want to filter out
        territoriesInclude: [] # territories you want to filter out (territory for Apple e.g. TWN)
```
- You just need to add the `FilterProcessor` settings in the `processors` section of `/config/apple.yml` or `/config/android.yml`.

#### Add Automatic Translation Functionality

Automatically translate reviews in languages other than yours using the Google Cloud Translation API (costs may apply).
- **Please ensure that the GCP Project associated with the Service Account created in Step 2 has the "Cloud Translation API" enabled.**
- The settings for `apple.yml` and `android.yml` are slightly different.

`apple.yml:`
```bash
    - GoogleTranslateProcessor: # Google Translate Processor, will translate review text to your language, you can remove the whole block if you don't need it.
        class: "GoogleTranslateProcessor"
        enable: true # enable
        googleTranslateAPIKeyFilePath: './config/XXXX-XXXX.json' # Google Translate API Service Account Credential .json File Path
        googleTranslateTargetLang: 'zh-TW' # Translate to what Language
        googleTranslateTerritoriesExclude: ["TWN","CHN"] # Review origin Territory that you don't want to translate. (territory for Apple e.g. TWN)
```
- `./config/XXXX-XXXX.json` (the name of the `XXXX-XXXX.json` Service Account key file saved in Step 2. GCP IAM)
```

`android.yml:`
```bash
    - GoogleTranslateProcessor: # Google Translate Processor, will translate review text to your language, you can remove whole block if you don't need it.
        class: "GoogleTranslateProcessor"
        enable: true # enable
        googleTranslateAPIKeyFilePath: './config/XXXX-XXXX.json' # Google Translate API Service Account Credential .json File Path
        googleTranslateTargetLang: 'zh-TW' # Translate to what Language
        googleTranslateTerritoriesExclude: ["zh-Hant","zh-Hans"] # Review origin Territory (language) that you don't want to translate. (language for android e.g. zh-Hant, en)
```
- `./config/XXXX-XXXX.json` \(Step 2\. GCP IAM Save the `XXXX-XXXX.json` Service Account key file name\)


**Complete Combination Example:**
```yaml

    - SlackProcessor: # Slack Processor, resend App Review to Slack.
        class: "SlackProcessor"
        enable: true # enable
        slackTimeZoneOffset: "+08:00" # Review Created Date TimeZone
        slackAttachmentGroupByNumber: "1" # 1~100, how many review message in 1 slack message.
        slackBotToken: "" # Slack Bot Token, send slack message through Slack Bot.
        slackBotTargetChannel: "" # Slack Bot Token, send slack message through Slack Bot. (recommended, first priority)
