- [**[English Version]** : [Quick Start! ] Github Action x ZReviewTender Free and Fast Deployment of Your App Store Review Monitoring Bot](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender/blob/main/quickstart.md){:target="_blank"}

### [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"}

[![](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/516425682/1cc1a829-d87d-4d4a-925b-60471b912b23)](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"}

ZReviewTender — is an open-source app review bot I created in August 2022. It automatically fetches user reviews from the iOS App Store and Android Google Play Store and forwards them to a specified Slack channel.

You can also specify review retrieval rules, integrate with Google Translate, Asana, Google Sheets, and support custom operations.

### [Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions){:target="_blank"}

Github Action is a CI/CD automation integration tool provided by Github. We can use our own machines as servers (Github Runner) or directly use machines provided by Github to run CI/CD and automation scripts.

#### Costs and Limitations

- Using Your Own Machine (Github Runner):  
  [No special fees, only limits on maximum runs, concurrency, and some short-term API request limits.](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#usage-limits){:target="_blank"}

- [Using machines provided by Github:](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#included-storage-and-minutes){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*QyhxZ98B20NV18-W5vKJDg.png)

GitHub Free offers basic 500 MB Storage (for CI/CD Artifacts) and 2,000 minutes of monthly runtime.

[**Note here due to machine cost issues:**](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#minute-multipliers){:target="_blank"}

- If you use a Windows machine on Github, the consumed minutes equal the actual minutes multiplied by 2.

- If you use Github's macOS machines, the consumed minutes equal the actual minutes multiplied by 10.

For detailed pricing calculations, please refer to the [official pricing calculator](https://github.com/pricing/calculator?feature=actions){:target="_blank"}.

> [***ZReviewTender***](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="*blank"} **_Minutes per month usage: about 120 minutes***

> *Only needs to run on basic priced Linux, each execution takes ≤ 1 minute, set to run every 6 hours by default, using 4 minutes per day, about 120 minutes per month, well within the free tier.*

> [***ZReviewTender***](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="*blank"} **_Storage usage: 0***

> *No use of Artifact for data storage, so there is no Storage overhead.*

### [Slack](https://slack.com/){:target="_blank"}

The company’s internal communication software creates a Slack App and uses this Slack App identity to forward app store review notifications to a designated channel.

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*HMMyU5jwY9iAMyiKmNgVJQ.png)

### [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} x [Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions){:target="_blank"} x [Slack](https://slack.com/){:target="_blank"}

> *We use Github Action to run the ZReviewTender script and send results to Slack. The Github Repo (Action) serves only as a carrier, so even if your main project is not hosted on Github, you can still easily deploy ZReviewTender by following the steps below. 🎉🎉🎉*

> ***I have successfully deployed it in various apps for 5 different companies, running smoothly and free of charge for over 2 years.***

#### Advantages:

- **Free**: [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} is an open-source free service I created, deployed on [Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions){:target="_blank"} with plenty of free usage quota.  
  You don’t need to pay monthly fees for app review bot services anymore.

- **Security**: Credentials and keys used for fetching reviews are securely stored in your Github Private Repo, accessible only by you.  
  You no longer need to risk exposing important credentials or keys by uploading them to third-party services; [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} is an open-source project, and all operations are open to public scrutiny.

- **Reliable**: [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} uses the latest official API to fetch review data. Compared to other services that use RSS feeds, it is more accurate, stable, and reliable.

> [***If this project has helped you, please consider buying me a coffee. Thank you.***](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/zhgchgli){:target="_blank"}

### Quick Start!🚀

> ***The entire setup takes about 30 minutes but only needs to be done once. Unless the certificate key changes, it can run stably and free forever.*** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

#### Step 1. Create a Slack App

If your organization already has a Slack App with messaging permissions like `chat:write`, you can reuse it directly without creating a new one.

[**Go to Slack Apps Homepage:**](https://api.slack.com/apps){:target="_blank"}

![<https://api.slack.com/apps>{:target="_blank"}](/assets/0095528cf875/1*JDaxmORRL3ipdeA0ZaHW3w.png)

<https://api.slack.com/apps>{:target="_blank"}

Click the top right corner "Create New App".

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*sFxmX9qty4UEgMhiTglEfA.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*XiqfLoEmITHyF9E-rDPjPQ.png)

1. Choose: From scratch

2. Enter App Name: `ZReviewTender` or a custom Slack App name

3. Select the target Slack Workspace for installation: Please ensure you have permission to add Slack Apps in the Workspace you choose.

4. Create App

**Add OAuth & Permissions Scopes:**  
After creating the Slack app, go to the "OAuth & Permissions" tab to set the scopes.

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*VjXVtAkVN8PLtCAOHocAmA.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*WSNd89bJuG1xCIPM9SsLnA.png)

1. Select "OAuth & Permissions"

2. Scroll down to find the Scopes Section

3. Enter the three essential Scopes for adding the ZReviewTender Slack App in order:

```vbnet
chat:write
chat:write.public
links:write
```

**Install App**  
Go back to the Install App tab to install the Slack App to the Workspace.

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*qItvJK5tZ-i8vE5bNUZIKQ.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*Eevu3Sir68DhfFSrFKb1xg.png)

1. Select "Install App"

2. Click "Install to *YOUR_WORKSPACE*"

3. Click "Allow"

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*lj8KZ5bEOG9urPgtxet-YA.png)

After installation, return to the Install App page to find the `Slack App Bot User OAuth Token`. Click "Copy" to copy it, **make sure to save it for later use**.

**Create a Channel for Pre-Received Review Notifications:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*vwILile0Y52PgjQAYLqGjQ.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*jZwuovjXaCbQiWTixOP5Dg.png)

- Sidebar -> Channels -> Create -> Create channel

- Name: Enter the desired channel name

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*cK8ihh9IQPacTjGKG4GS3Q.png)

**Visibility:**

- Public: Open to everyone, no further action required.

- **Private: Private channel,** ⭐️⭐️⭐️ **need to add the newly created Slack App:**

**How to Add Slack App to a Channel:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*AgCjAYb94XOmlIJ7VV6gaw.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*GVqrJlBg_9MjVyGitA2g-A.png)

1. Click the #channel name above

2. Click "Settings"

3. Click "Add an App"

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*KU5hdi2m46TUwZbjI-xKmg.png)

1. Search for the Slack App name you just created

2. Click "Add"

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*Qx2XPK8lspCrSauWE4IhXA.png)

Joining a successful channel will display a prompt phrase. `ZReviewTender joined.`

> ***⭐️⭐️⭐️Here is a Slack bug: newly created Slack Apps may not be searchable immediately and take some time to appear; you can use Public Channels first, which do not require adding the Slack App to use.***

**Get Channel ID:**  
The final and most important step is to get the Channel ID, which will be used later for configuration.

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*CmQtV9QibdOb8zHuiYJS2Q.png)

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*VNmLOs0mBhF6qisDzx6Zcw.png)

1. Click the #channel-name above

2. You will find the Channel ID information at the bottom

3. **Note down the `Channel ID` for later configuration**

> ***Slack steps completed.***

— — —

**Other Notes:**

**You can edit the Slack App name and icon in "Basic Information" -> "Display Information":**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*5THTrkeWXYa5QaGCNCmzhQ.png)

Remember to click "Save Changes" at the bottom right to save your edits.

**If OAuth & Permissions Scopes are added, you need to click "reinstall your app" to take effect:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*pUdxf_G1uoHcq22VGjHOzw.png)

#### Step 2. Generate Apple App Store Connect API & Google Play Android Developer API Credentials

#### Apple App Store Connect API Credentials

**iOS is easier; we only need to get the following four pieces of information from App Store Connect:**

**Issuer ID:**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/0*eHn-LMnUlS-04d70.png)

- App Store Connect -> Keys -> [App Store Connect API](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/api){:target="_blank"}

- **Note down the `Issuer ID` for later setup**

**Private Key ID & Private Key:**

Click the "+" button to add:

![](/assets/0095528cf875/0*MI0-cA0BTkq5XqkT.png)

- Name: `ZReviewTender`

- Access: `App Manager`

![](/assets/0095528cf875/0*V0U2HjKTRfL8dl1j.png)

- `Key ID` **, to be set later for use**

- **Click "Download API Key" to save the downloaded `AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8` file for later setup.**

**App ID : (The target App ID to fetch reviews)**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*zCgRRm0-nDwvcGOv26Aprw.png)

App ID can be found in [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps){:target="_blank"} -> App Store -> General -> App Information -> `App ID`.

- **Note down the `App ID` for later configuration**

#### Google Play Android Developer API Credentials

Android is more complex. You need to first enable the API in the Google Cloud Project associated with the app, create a Service Account, and add the Service Account to the Google Play Console with app permissions.

[**Go to Google Cloud Project:**](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome){:target="_blank"}

Select the Google Cloud Project for your app project or create a new Project.

**Enable "Android Developer API":**

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*zvWFDBuPRq9a6bizjqrx4Q.png)

1. Refresh the list page, then click to enter the newly created Service Account.

2. Click "Add Key"

3. Click "Create New Key"

4. Select the key type as "JSON"

5. Click "Create"

6. **Save the downloaded `XXXX-XXXX.json` file for later configuration**

**Add the service account to Google Play Console and grant permissions to the target app for fetching reviews:**

[**Enter the Google Play Console backend:**](https://play.google.com/console/){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/0095528cf875/1*Lbowza_thZaSDx5BuRWMsg.png)

1. Click "Users and permissions"

### Other Settings

#### Add Filtering Functionality

Only forward reviews that meet the criteria.

```yaml
    - FilterProcessor:
        class: "FilterProcessor"
        enable: true # enable
        keywordsInclude: [] # keywords you want to filter out
        ratingsInclude: [] # ratings you want to filter out
        territoriesInclude: [] # territories you want to filter out (territory for Apple e.g. TWN)
```

- You only need to add the `FilterProcessor` setting in the `processors` section of `/config/apple.yml` or `/config/android.yml`.

#### Add Automatic Translation Feature

Automatically translate reviews not in your language using Google Cloud Translation API (charges apply).

- **Please first ensure that the GCP Project of the Service Account created in Step 2 has the "Cloud Translation API" enabled**

- `apple.yml` and `android.yml` have some different settings

`apple.yml:`

```bash
    - GoogleTranslateProcessor: # Google Translate Processor, will translate review text to your language, you can remove whole block if you don't need it.
        class: "GoogleTranslateProcessor"
        enable: true # enable
        googleTranslateAPIKeyFilePath: './config/XXXX-XXXX.json' # Google Translate API Service Account Credential .json File Path
        googleTranslateTargetLang: 'zh-TW' # Translate to what Language
        googleTranslateTerritoriesExclude: ["TWN","CHN"] # Review origin Territory that you don't want to translate. (territory for Apple e.g. TWN)
```

- `./config/XXXX-XXXX.json` (Step 2. The `XXXX-XXXX.json` Service Account key file name saved from GCP IAM)

`android.yml:`

```bash
    - GoogleTranslateProcessor: # Google Translate Processor, will translate review text to your language, you can remove whole block if you don't need it.
        class: "GoogleTranslateProcessor"
        enable: true # enable
        googleTranslateAPIKeyFilePath: './config/XXXX-XXXX.json' # Google Translate API Service Account Credential .json File Path
        googleTranslateTargetLang: 'zh-TW' # Translate to which language
        googleTranslateTerritoriesExclude: ["zh-Hant","zh-Hans"] # Review origin territory (language) that you don't want to translate. (language for android e.g. zh-Hant, en)
```

- `./config/XXXX-XXXX.json` (Step 2. The Service Account key file name `XXXX-XXXX.json` saved from GCP IAM)

**Complete Example:**

```yaml
platform: 'android'
packageName: '' # Android App Package Name
keyFilePath: '' # Google Android Publisher API Service Account Credential .json File Path
playConsoleDeveloperAccountID: '' # Google Console Developer Account ID
playConsoleAppID: '' # Google Console App ID

    - GoogleTranslateProcessor: # Google Translate Processor, will translate review text to your language, you can remove whole block if you don't need it.
        class: "GoogleTranslateProcessor"
        enable: true # enable
        googleTranslateAPIKeyFilePath: '' # Google Translate API Service Account Credential .json File Path
        googleTranslateTargetLang: 'zh-TW' # Translate to what language
        googleTranslateTerritoriesExclude: ["zh-Hant","zh-Hans"] # Review origin territory (language) that you don't want to translate. (language for android e.g. zh-Hant, en)
    - SlackProcessor: # Slack Processor, resend App Review to Slack.
        class: "SlackProcessor"
        enable: true # enable
        slackTimeZoneOffset: "+08:00" # Review Created Date TimeZone
        slackAttachmentGroupByNumber: "1" # 1~100, how many review messages in 1 Slack message.
        slackBotToken: "" # Slack Bot Token, send Slack message through Slack Bot.
        slackBotTargetChannel: "" # Slack Bot Token, send Slack message through Slack Bot. (recommended, first priority)
        slackInCommingWebHookURL: "" # Slack Incoming WebHook URL, send Slack message through Incoming WebHook, not recommended, deprecated.
