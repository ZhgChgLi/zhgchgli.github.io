> *Thanks to [Men’s Game 玩物誌](https://www.facebook.com/mensgametw/){:target="_blank"} for providing the Apple Watch Series 4 protective case for testing.*

As a careless person with OCD, using a delicate product like the Apple Watch is very frustrating; being clumsy and careless makes it easy to accidentally bump it, and with OCD, any scratches are very upsetting. So, right after buying it, I immediately applied a full-coverage screen protector to prevent accidents.

But actually, **just applying a full-coverage screen protector is not enough. The watch itself has a curved surface, and the edges of the protector are fragile and can easily chip if the watch's frame accidentally rubs against something**:

![Full-screen protector edge damage without a protective case](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*Pqap-5lrHUEWBonbKHXrAA.jpeg)

Full-screen protector edge chipping issue without a case

I have already replaced the full-screen protector three times; although the watch screen itself is not damaged, it still hurts my heart. Perfect fit + no impact on touch + thin + high transparency + no lifting edges = very expensive ($990 each). The money spent on protectors is almost enough for me to upgrade to the stainless steel version. Therefore, a protective case for the Apple Watch is very important to me, as it can enhance the protection of the watch’s frame and reduce damage from impacts.

This article will review two Apple Watch cases, comparing their user experience, functionality, design, and suitable scenarios. Let’s get started!

This case features an integrated design with a strap, providing full protection from wearing comfort to shock and water resistance.

Fixed Dowel Joint

Compared to the original sports strap (L), it has a similar length but with more holes, allowing for a better fit to wrist size; the fixed ring has a latch to ensure it won't come off during intense exercise.

#### Installation:

We need to first disassemble the Catalyst case, then place the Apple Watch body inside before reassembling it.

1. First, unscrew the screws on the back cover.

2. After removing the screws, hold the watch strap with both hands and use your thumbs to push the watch case outward.

When installing, make sure the waterproof cover is properly fitted without any wrinkles to ensure waterproofing.

6. Put on the protective case and attach the cover

Make sure there are no wrinkles to avoid affecting the waterproofing.

7. Reattach the watch strap body and tighten the screws

Reattach the main body and tighten the screws (**please be careful not to overtighten the screws!**)

#### Test:

1. Charging can be directly attached:

4. Digital Crown

Can be used normally ✅

5. Audio Recording Impact:

No significant difference ✅

6. Appearance:

Because I have big hands, I originally bought the largest 44mm version of the watch. After adding a protective case, it looks even more rugged and bold.

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*ibQF9d8Z-bJhsJY4wo9H0Q.jpeg)

#### Thoughts:

This watch strap truly provides 360° full protection and enhances its waterproof capability to adapt to harsher environments.

The strap uses the same skin-friendly material, feeling no different from the original sports strap. However, due to the denser holes for adjustment, it can be set to a more suitable size (with the original strap, I was stuck between a hole that was too loose and the next one too tight). Also, the clasp on the loop gives someone like me, who is a bit obsessive, more peace of mind!

The overall look is wild and rugged, perfect for outdoor activities, hiking, climbing, and diving. This is exactly the scenario where this watch strap offers the greatest protection!

Next time, remember to bring sunglasses; the sun is very strong.

### Muvit Apple Watch Protective Case

The second product tested is the Muvit Apple Watch case. Compared to Catalyst's professional protection, this one is simpler and more convenient, suitable for various daily life scenarios. That said, Muvit still passes the US military standard MIL-STD 810G 3-meter drop test, ensuring reliable safety protection!

#### Unboxing and Usage:

![Front of the box](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*-i3rLhQgb4DjbICi123_OA.jpeg)

Front of the box

Two different colored cases: Left - Black / Right - Light Purple

Try-on, Left: Black / Right: Light Purple

#### Test:

Digital Crown:

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*YAzNl8KPlYdkhWVThowL2Q.jpeg)

Works normally ✅. Other functions like audio recording, heart rate, display, etc., are not affected since this is just a bumper case, so no special testing was done!

#### Thoughts:

The best feature of this case is that I can easily and quickly switch straps according to different life scenarios (suit: leather strap, daily: sports strap). It’s easy to install and remove, and provides enough protection for all daily situations (doing housework, cleaning, moving things). I currently use this case for everyday life.

### Summary:

More than four months passed from receiving the trial to finishing this article. During this time, I experienced moving (Sorry... the photos in this article are a bit messy), participated in a triathlon (10KM running + 40KM cycling), and went diving in Malaysia. These two cases have accompanied me through mountains and seas, running and jumping, and the full-screen protector remains flawless!

Do you remember how many screen protectors I changed? The answer is 3 in 3 months. On average, each one gets damaged and chipped in less than a month for some reason. Each costs $990. Orz

> I can only say, I wish I had known earlier. If I had known about protective cases, I wouldn't have wasted extra money!

Both Catalyst and Muvit have solved my problem of screen protector edges chipping. If you don't use a screen protector, you should definitely get a case to protect the screen corners, or else a cracked screen will be even more heartbreaking.

The recommendation for choosing is: if you often engage in intense sports (rock climbing, diving) or manual labor, it is advisable to choose Catalyst for better protection; if you are a regular office worker, occasionally run, or like to change watch bands based on your mood, Muvit is sufficient!

### Chat:

From [the first full unboxing](../a2920e33e73e/) to [after three months of use](../e85d77b05061/), it's been almost a year since I started wearing the Apple Watch S4. There have been no major changes in usage; third-party apps are still few. The most used features remain Apple Pay, unlocking my Mac, and checking notifications. The Apple Watch has truly become part of my daily life, and I’ve grown accustomed to its convenience.

> *by the way, let's look forward to Watch OS 6 together :)*

In the past six months, I have been more diligent in using the Apple Watch's fitness features to track running and cycling time, routes, and heart rate. Beyond just recording data, the badges give you goals and a sense of achievement. Competing with friends or sharing results on social media makes exercising fun, which helps you stay consistent!
