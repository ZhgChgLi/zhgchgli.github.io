As someone who is a bit clumsy and has obsessive-compulsive tendencies, using a delicate product like the Apple Watch can be quite stressful; my clumsiness makes it easy to accidentally bump into things, and my compulsive nature makes it frustrating to use a device with scratches. Therefore, I immediately covered it with a full-screen protector to prevent any accidents.

However, **just using a full-screen protector is not enough; the watch itself has a curved surface, and the edges of the protector are fragile, making it easy for the edges to chip if they accidentally rub against the body of the watch**:

![Without a case, the tragic state of the full-screen protector's chipped edges](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*Pqap-5lrHUEWBonbKHXrAA.jpeg)

Without a case, the tragic state of the full-screen protector's chipped edges

I have already replaced the full-screen protector three times; although the watch screen itself is unharmed, it still pains me to see it. A perfect fit + no impact on touch + thin + high transparency + no lifting edges = very expensive \($990 each\). The money spent on protectors is almost enough for me to upgrade to the stainless steel version; thus, an Apple Watch case is very important to me as it can enhance the protection of the watch's edges and reduce the risk of damage from bumps.

In this article, I will unbox two types of Apple Watch cases and compare their experiences, functionalities, appearance, and applicable scenarios. Let's get started!

_p\.s\. My watch model is: Apple Watch Series 4 \(GPS + Cellular\), 44mm space gray aluminum case paired with a black sport band_

### Catalyst Apple Watch Ultra-Thin Waterproof Case \(including strap\)

This case features an integrated design that includes the strap, providing comprehensive protection from wear and tear, as well as water resistance.
#### Unboxing Experience:

![Front of the box](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*V3vIwfECipkbgbNMV_hs5g.jpeg)

Front of the box

100 meters waterproof / 360° all-around protection / 2 meters drop protection

![Back of the box](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*rCGyyBw17l93HaVLkfPv4Q.jpeg)

Back of the box

IP\-68 waterproof rating, each product is tested at a depth of 100 meters, military-grade impact protection, direct screen operation, original sound quality for calls, charging through the case, and heart rate detection through the case.

**IP\-68 \( [Wiki](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E9%99%85%E9%98%B2%E6%8A%A4%E7%AD%89%E7%BA%A7%E8%AE%A4%E8%AF%81){:target="_blank"} \):**

Contents

In addition to the Catalyst Apple Watch case itself \(which contains a model watch\), a small screwdriver is included for easy installation.

Comparison with original sport band \(L\) (Left: Catalyst / Right: Original\)

![Fixed ring buckle](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*epVVh0SvkWw_KUN9vZ2EfQ.jpeg)

Fixed ring buckle

Compared to the original sport band \(L\), the length is similar, but the holes are denser, allowing for better adjustment to fit wrist size; the fixed ring has a buckle that ensures it won't fall off during intense activities.
#### Installation:

We need to first disassemble the Catalyst case, then place the Apple Watch body inside and reassemble it.
1. First, unscrew the back of the watch.

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*W-gLZXVO1yJNgXJlNJZmGA.jpeg)

2. After removing the screw, hold the strap with both hands and use your thumbs to push the case body outwards.

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*zuKuxfU47WUxlGtSTdujvw.jpeg)

3. Disassemble all the components.

4. Remove the Apple Watch body from the existing sport band.

![Flip to the back and press the rectangular buckle with your nail, then push left or right!](https://assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*MwDh_iQQNvwLRa-4uZTS4A.jpeg)

Flip to the back and press the rectangular buckle with your nail, then push left or right!

5. Place the Apple Watch body into the waterproof sleeve.

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*I_QwQJ6ywR5R6TN8FRSByA.jpeg)

Make sure the waterproof sleeve is fitted properly without any wrinkles to avoid affecting waterproofing.

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*KrpGVeW2qXIb8UeNizrp1A.jpeg)

6. Attach the top shell of the case.

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*DZiQG08CWoAhg7norvU8lw.jpeg)

Again, ensure there are no wrinkles to avoid affecting waterproofing.

7. Reattach the strap body and screw it back on.

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*-8sAoAOg2tu_gzabuZvRww.jpeg)

Reattach the body and screw it back on \( **Be careful not to screw it too tightly!** \)
#### Testing:
1. Charging can be done directly:

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*iUopCGpye4pjoP1CdjvfDw.jpeg)

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*COoQIHhRpUYWl8bdbAGTBw.png)

Test result: No issues, charging speed is unaffected.

2. Heart Rate:

![Left: With case / Right: Bare device](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*z0bWL3LTEyln6SEk1nZrSw.jpeg)

Left: With case / Right: Bare device

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*FIa4v3sxjrCthupmY_FUiw.png)

Test result: No issues, heart rate detection is unaffected.

3. Display:

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*RFRpBr_IkJDA4Y6ryx7W_g.jpeg)

Apple Watch 4 full-screen display is unobstructed, no issues ✅

4. Digital Crown:

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*B9md7k4pmOkgL8LuS1V8Ww.jpeg)

Works normally ✅

5. Audio quality:

[![Catalyst Apple Watch Ultra-Thin Waterproof Case Audio Test](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/e686_hqdefault.jpg "Catalyst Apple Watch Ultra-Thin Waterproof Case Audio Test")](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZfe5BUkhZM){:target="_blank"}

No significant differences ✅

6. Appearance:

Since I have large hands and the watch is already the largest 44mm version, adding the case makes it look even bulkier.

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*ibQF9d8Z-bJhsJY4wo9H0Q.jpeg)

#### Thoughts:

This strap truly achieves 360° comprehensive protection and enhances the waterproof functionality to adapt to more challenging environments.

The strap is made from skin-friendly materials, and wearing it feels no different from the original sport band. However, due to the denser hole spacing, it can be adjusted to a more suitable size \(I find the original strap too loose in one notch and too tight in the next\), and the fixed ring's buckle gives me, as an obsessive-compulsive person, a bit more peace of mind!

The overall appearance is rugged and wild, making it suitable for outdoor activities, hiking, climbing, and diving, which is when this strap can provide maximum protection!

### Muvit Apple Watch Case

The second product I tested is the Muvit Apple Watch case, which, compared to the professional protection of the Catalyst, is simpler and more convenient, suitable for various everyday life scenarios; that said, Muvit still passed the U.S. military standard MIL\-STD 810G 3-meter drop test, ensuring safety without compromise!
#### Unboxing Experience:

![Front of the box](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*-i3rLhQgb4DjbICi123_OA.jpeg)

Front of the box

Two different color cases: Left - Black / Right - Light Purple

U.S. military standard MIL\-STD 810G 3-meter drop test, extremely lightweight at 2.3g

![Back of the box](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*dGl4CaH47Cc8gC5U4JUVFg.jpeg)

Back of the box

![Trying on, Left: Black / Right: Light Purple](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*pB3bwjNNTfaCpiUWZNBlMw.jpeg)

Trying on, Left: Black / Right: Light Purple
#### Testing:

Digital Crown:

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*YAzNl8KPlYdkhWVThowL2Q.jpeg)

Works normally ✅, other items like audio, heart rate, display, etc., are not affected since this model is just a frame protector, so no special tests are needed!
#### Thoughts:

What I appreciate most about this case is that I can easily and quickly switch straps according to different life scenarios \(suit: leather strap, daily: sport strap\). It's easy to install and provides enough protection for all daily scenarios \(doing housework, cleaning, moving things\). Currently, I use this case for my daily life.

### Summary of Thoughts:

It has been over four months since I received the test products and completed this article, during which I moved \(Sorry… the scenes in this article are messy\), participated in a triathlon \(10KM running + 40KM cycling\), and went diving in Malaysia; these two cases have accompanied me through mountains and seas, and my full-screen protector is still perfect!

Do you remember how many protectors I replaced? The answer is 3 protectors in 3 months, averaging less than a month before they get chipped. Each one costs $990, Orz.

> I can only say that I wish I had known sooner; if I had known about protective cases like these, I wouldn't have wasted so much money!

Both Catalyst and Muvit have solved my problem of constantly chipping edges on protectors. If you don't use a protector, you should definitely get a case to protect the screen's edges; otherwise, a cracked screen will hurt even more.

As for recommendations, if you often engage in intense sports \(climbing, diving\) or labor-intensive work, I suggest choosing Catalyst for peace of mind; if you're just an office worker who occasionally exercises or likes to change straps according to your mood, then Muvit will be sufficient!

### Chat:

```markdown
From [the first complete unboxing](../a2920e33e73e/) to [three months of use](../e85d77b05061/), it has been almost a year since I started wearing my Apple Watch S4. There haven't been many changes in usage; third-party apps are still quite limited. The most frequently used features remain Apple Pay, unlocking my Mac, and checking notifications. The Apple Watch has seamlessly integrated into my daily life, and I've grown accustomed to its convenience.

> _By the way, let's look forward to Watch OS 6 together :\)_

In the past six months, I've been more diligent in utilizing the Apple Watch's fitness features, recording my running and cycling times, routes, and heart rate. Besides just tracking, the awards give you a sense of purpose and achievement in your workouts. Competing with friends on activity levels or sharing results on social media makes exercising a fun endeavor, making it easier to stay motivated!
