### Apple Watch Case Unboxing Experience \(Catalyst & Muvit\)

Catalyst Apple Watch ultra-thin waterproof case & Muvit Apple Watch case

As someone with a bit of a clumsy and obsessive personality, using a delicate product like the Apple Watch can be quite troubling; my clumsiness makes it easy to accidentally bump into things, and my obsessive nature makes it frustrating to use something that has scratches. Therefore, I immediately covered it with a full-screen protector to prevent any accidents.

However, **just using a full-screen protector is not enough. The watch itself has a curved surface, and the edges of the protector are fragile, making it easy for the edges to chip if they accidentally rub against the body’s frame**:


![Without a case, the tragic situation of the full-screen protector's chipped edges](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*Pqap-5lrHUEWBonbKHXrAA.jpeg)

Without a case, the tragic situation of the full-screen protector's chipped edges

I have already replaced the full-screen protector three times; although the watch's screen itself is unharmed, it still pains me. A perfect fit + no impact on touch + thin + high transparency + no lifting edges = very expensive \($990 per piece\). The money spent on protectors is almost enough for me to upgrade to the stainless steel version; thus, the Apple Watch case is very important to me as it can enhance the protection of the body’s frame and reduce the risk of damage from collisions.

In this article, I will unbox two types of Apple Watch cases and compare them based on experience, functionality, appearance, and applicable scenarios. Let’s get started!

_p\.s\. My watch model is: Apple Watch Series 4 \(GPS + Cellular\), 44mm space gray aluminum case paired with a black sport band_
### Catalyst Apple Watch Ultra-Thin Waterproof Case \(with strap\)

This case features an integrated design that includes the strap, providing comprehensive protection from wear and tear, as well as waterproofing.
#### Unboxing Experience:


![Front of the box](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*V3vIwfECipkbgbNMV_hs5g.jpeg)

Front of the box

In addition to the Catalyst Apple Watch case itself \(which contains a model watch\), a small screwdriver is included for easy installation.

![Fixed Ring Locking Mechanism](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*epVVh0SvkWw_KUN9vZ2EfQ.jpeg)

Fixed Ring Locking Mechanism

The length is similar to the original sports strap (L), but the holes are denser, allowing for better adjustment to fit wrist sizes; the locking mechanism on the fixed ring ensures it won't come off during intense activities.
#### Installation:

First, we need to disassemble the Catalyst case, then place the Apple Watch body inside and reassemble it.
1. First, unscrew the back screws



![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*W-gLZXVO1yJNgXJlNJZmGA.jpeg)


2. After removing the screws, hold the strap with both hands and use your thumbs to push the case body outwards.

3. Disassemble all components

5. Place the Apple Watch body into the waterproof case


![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*I_QwQJ6ywR5R6TN8FRSByA.jpeg)


During installation, please ensure the waterproof case is fitted properly without wrinkles to avoid affecting waterproof performance.

6. Attach the top shell of the protective case


![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*DZiQG08CWoAhg7norvU8lw.jpeg)


Again, ensure there are no wrinkles to avoid affecting waterproof performance.

7. Reattach the strap body and secure the screws


![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*-8sAoAOg2tu_gzabuZvRww.jpeg)


Reattach the body and secure the screws (**Please be careful not to tighten the screws too much!**)
#### Testing:
1. Charging can be directly attached:

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*COoQIHhRpUYWl8bdbAGTBw.png)

2. Heart Rate:

3. Display:

Apple Watch 4 full-screen display is unobstructed, no issues ✅

4. Digital Crown

Can be used normally ✅

5. Audio Impact:

No special differences ✅

6. Appearance:

Due to my large hands, I originally bought the largest 44mm version of the watch, and after adding a protective case, it looks even more rugged and substantial.

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*ibQF9d8Z-bJhsJY4wo9H0Q.jpeg)

#### Thoughts:

This watch band truly achieves 360° full protection and enhances its waterproof functionality to adapt to more challenging environments.

The band is made of skin-friendly material, and wearing it feels no different from the original sports band. However, due to the denser hole spacing for adjustments, it can be tailored to a more suitable size (when wearing the original band, I often find myself in an awkward situation where one notch forward is too loose and one notch back is too tight). The locking mechanism of the fixed ring also gives me, as a perfectionist, a bit more peace of mind!

The overall appearance is wild and rugged, making it a great match for outdoor activities, hiking, climbing, and diving. This is precisely the scenario where this watch band can provide maximum protective benefits!

### Muvit Apple Watch Protective Case

The second product I tried is the Muvit Apple Watch protective case. Compared to the professional protection of the Catalyst, this one is simpler and more convenient, suitable for various everyday life scenarios. That said, Muvit still passed the U.S. military standard MIL-STD 810G 3-meter drop test, ensuring safety protection is not compromised!
#### Unboxing and Usage:


![Front of the box](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*-i3rLhQgb4DjbICi123_OA.jpeg)

Front of the box

1. Installation is very simple; first, remove the Apple Watch from the existing sports band.

#### Testing:

Digital Crown:


![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*YAzNl8KPlYdkhWVThowL2Q.jpeg)


Can be used normally ✅. Other functions such as audio, heart rate, display, etc., are not affected since this model is just a frame protective case, so I won't test them specifically!
#### Thoughts:

What I am most satisfied with about this protective case is that I can easily and quickly switch to the corresponding band based on my daily scenarios (suit: leather band, everyday: sports band). It is easy to assemble and disassemble, and the protection is sufficient for all daily situations (doing housework, cleaning, moving things). Currently, I use this protective case for my daily life.

### Summary of Thoughts:

It has been over four months since I received the trial products until I finished writing this article. During this time, I experienced moving (Sorry… the scenes in this article are messy), participated in a triathlon (10KM running + 40KM cycling), and went diving in Malaysia; these two protective cases have accompanied me through mountains and seas, running and jumping, and the full-screen protective film is still perfect!


Do you remember how many screen protectors I changed? The answer is 3 in 3 months, averaging less than a month before they get damaged and chipped. Each one costs $990, sigh.

> I can only say it's a case of too little, too late. If I had known about products like protective cases, I wouldn't have wasted so much money!

Both Catalyst and Muvit have solved my issue of screen protectors constantly chipping. If you haven't applied a screen protector, you should definitely get a case to protect the corners of your screen; otherwise, the pain of a shattered screen will be even worse.

As for recommendations, if you often engage in intense sports (like rock climbing or diving) or manual labor, I suggest choosing Catalyst for peace of mind. If you're just an office worker who occasionally exercises or likes to change watch bands according to your mood, then Muvit will be sufficient!

### Chit-chat:

From [the first complete unboxing](../a2920e33e73e/) to [three months of use](../e85d77b05061/), it’s been almost a year since I got my Apple Watch S4; there haven't been many changes in usage, and there are still very few third-party apps. The most frequently used features remain Apple Pay, unlocking my Mac, and checking notifications. The Apple Watch has seamlessly integrated into my daily life, and I’ve grown accustomed to its convenience.

> _By the way, let’s look forward to Watch OS 6 together! :\)_

In the past six months, I've been more diligent in utilizing the Apple Watch's fitness features, recording my running and cycling times, routes, and heart rates. Besides tracking, the medals give you more goals and a sense of achievement, competing with friends on activity levels or sharing results on social media makes exercising fun, making it easier to stay motivated!
