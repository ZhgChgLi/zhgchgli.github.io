### The Evolution of iOS Privacy and Convenience

Apple's privacy principles and the adjustments made to privacy protection features in iOS over the years



![Theme by [slidego](https://slidesgo.com/theme/cyber-security-business-plan#search-technology&position-3&results-12){:target="_blank"}](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*-XkH2H6A9f7U1ex6eCo5Lg.png)

Theme by [slidego](https://slidesgo.com/theme/cyber-security-business-plan#search-technology&position-3&results-12){:target="_blank"}
### \[2023–08–01\] iOS 17 Update

An update on the latest privacy-related adjustments in iOS 17 following the previous presentation.
#### [Link Tracking Protection](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/apple-announces-powerful-new-privacy-and-security-features/){:target="_blank"}

Safari will automatically remove tracking parameters from URLs \(e\.g\. `fbclid`, `gclid`, etc.\)
- For example: `https://zhgchg.li/post/1?gclid=124` will change to `https://zhgchg.li/post/1` after clicking.
- Currently testing iOS 17 Developer Beta 4, `fbxxx`, `gcxxx`, etc. will be removed, while `utm_` will be retained; it's uncertain if the final version of iOS 17 or future iOS 18 will enhance this further.
- If you want to see the strictest effects, you can install the [iOS DuckDuckGo](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/duckduckgo-private-browser/id663592361){:target="_blank"} browser for testing.
- For detailed testing information, please refer to the article "[iOS 17 Safari's new features will remove fbclid and gclid from URLs](https://blog.user.today/ios17-safari-remove-fbclid-and-gclid/){:target="_blank"}" by 大大.

#### [Privacy Manifest \.xprivacy & Report](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10060/?time=88){:target="_blank"}

Developers must include declarations of the User Privacy they utilize, **and also require any SDKs used to provide their Privacy Manifest.**

_\*Additionally, third-party SDK signatures have been added._


![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*A9PNsZ-BJCZpU-AcJph3qg.png)


XCode 15 can generate a Privacy Report through the Manifest for developers to set App privacy in the App Store.


![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*84WTDYR0cfrQP3a0e8jB4g.png)

#### [Required reason API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api){:target="_blank"}

To prevent potential misuse of certain Foundation APIs that could lead to fingerprinting, Apple has begun to regulate some Foundation APIs; [a declaration of why they are needed must be included in the Manifest](https://developer.apple.com/cn/news/?id=z6fu1dcu){:target="_blank"}.

Currently, the most affected API is UserDefaults, which must be declared.
```
Starting in Fall 2023, if you upload a new App or App update to App Store Connect that uses an API requiring a declaration of reason (including content from third-party SDKs), and you do not provide an approved reason in the App's privacy manifest, you will receive a notification. Starting in Spring 2024, to upload new Apps or App updates to App Store Connect, you must specify an approved reason in the App's privacy manifest to accurately reflect how your App uses the corresponding API.

If the current approved reasons do not cover a use case for an API requiring a declaration, and you believe this use case directly benefits your App users, please let us know.
```
#### [Tracking Domain](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10060/?time=264){:target="_blank"}

The API domain that sends tracking information must be declared in the privacy manifest \.xprivacy and can only initiate network requests after user consent for tracking; otherwise, all network requests to this domain will be intercepted by the system.


![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*f849jUbgjLMPfdCnRVp2IA.png)


You can check if the Tracking Domain is being intercepted using the XCode Network tool:


![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*7j5UXZq_ZMt07IQ2wWZIBA.png)


Currently, Facebook and Google's Tracking Domains are detected and must be listed as Tracking Domains and permission requested.


![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*R4N7ofJfrDW6cmu2Q2Pdtw.png)

- [graph\.facebook\.com](https://graph.facebook.com/){:target="_blank"} : Facebook-related data statistics
- [app\-measurement\.com](https://app-measurement.com/){:target="_blank"} : Google-related data statistics: GA/Firebase, etc.

Therefore, please note that Facebook/Google data statistics may significantly decline after iOS 17, as failure to request permission or allow tracking will result in no data being received; based on past implementations, about 70% of users tend to click "Do Not Allow."
- Developers' own API tracking methods also need to comply with the above-listed Tracking Domain regulations.
- If the Tracking Domain is the same as the API Domain, a separate independent Tracking Domain must be created \(e\.g\. api\.zhgchg\.li \-&gt; tracking\.zhgchg\.li\).
- Currently, it is unclear how Apple will regulate developers' own Tracking; testing with XCode 15 did not reveal any issues.
- It is uncertain whether the official will use tools to detect behavior or if reviewers will manually check.

> Fingerprinting remains prohibited. 

### Introduction

I am honored to participate in the [MOPCON presentation](https://mopcon.org/2021/schedule/2021028){:target="_blank"}, but it is unfortunate that due to the pandemic, it was changed to an online live format, making it difficult to meet new friends; the theme of this presentation is "The Evolution of iOS Privacy and Convenience," where I aim to share Apple's principles regarding privacy and the functional adjustments made in iOS based on these principles over the years.


![[The Evolution of iOS Privacy and Convenience](https://mopcon.org/2021/schedule/2021028){:target="_blank"} \| [Pinkoi, We Are Hiring!](https://www.pinkoi.com/about/careers){:target="_blank"}](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*gYucHdBa4tyd9lX5eyr08w.png)

**I believe that developers and iPhone users should be familiar with the following functional adjustments over the past few years:**


![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*XyJpqYVWh1PNoMAzWtDnQQ.png)

- **iOS ≥ 13:** All Apps supporting third-party logins must implement Sign in with Apple; otherwise, they cannot be successfully published.
- **iOS ≥ 14:** Clipboard access warnings.
- **iOS ≥ 14.5:** IDFA must be allowed before access, which is almost equivalent to banning IDFA.
- **iOS ≥ 15:** Private Relay, using a proxy to hide the user's original IP address.
- **iOS ≥ 16:** Clipboard access requires user authorization.
- … and many more, which I will share later in the article.

#### Why?

If you are unclear about Apple's privacy principles, you might wonder why Apple has been at odds with developers and advertisers in recent years. Many features that users have become accustomed to have been restricted.

After reviewing the documents "[WWDC 2021 — Apple’s privacy pillars in focus](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10085/){:target="_blank"}" and "[Apple privacy white paper — A Day in the Life of Your Data](https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/A_Day_in_the_Life_of_Your_Data.pdf){:target="_blank"}," it became clear that we have unknowingly leaked a lot of personal privacy, allowing advertisers and social media to profit immensely, reaching an invasive level in our daily lives.

Referring to the [Apple privacy white paper](https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/A_Day_in_the_Life_of_Your_Data.pdf){:target="_blank"}, let’s illustrate how privacy is leaked and the potential harms using a fictional character, Harry.


![First, Harry's usage records on his iPhone.](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*f0F0ypi2F-6_yOTsBmynhg.png)

First, Harry's usage records on his iPhone.

**On the left is his web browsing history:** You can see he visited websites related to cars, iPhone 13, and luxury goods.

**On the right are the installed Apps:** There are apps for investment, travel, social networking, shopping, and even a baby monitor… these Apps.


![Harry's offline life](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*u7PRvQK9fyu7iLLdZFvAyQ.png)

Harry's offline life

Offline activities leave records in places such as: receipts, credit card transaction records, dashcam footage, etc.
#### Combination

You might wonder how browsing different websites, installing different Apps \(even without logging in\), and participating in offline activities could possibly allow a service to connect all this data?

**The answer is: it is technically feasible, and it "may" or "has already" partially occurred.**


![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*t6OJvmXAMsurcn6XuDuGng.png)


As shown in the image:
- When not logged in, websites can identify the same visitor across different sites using Third-Party Cookies, IP Address + device information to create a fingerprint.
- When logged in, websites can connect your data through registration information such as name, birthday, phone number, email, and ID number.
- Apps can identify the same user across different Apps by obtaining Device UUIDs, sniffing URL Schemes of other installed Apps, and using Pasteboard to transfer data between Apps; similarly, they can connect data using registration information after the user logs in.
- Apps and websites can also share data using Third-Party Cookies, fingerprints, and Pasteboard.
- The connection between online and offline activities may occur when banks collect credit card spending records, budgeting Apps, receipt collection Apps, dashcam Apps, etc., all of which have the potential to link offline activities with online data.

> **_It has been proven that it is technically feasible; so who are the third parties hiding behind all these websites and Apps?_** 

Companies like Facebook and Google generate significant revenue from personal advertising; many websites and Apps also integrate Facebook and Google SDKs… so it’s hard to say, and often we are unaware of which third-party advertising and data collection services are secretly recording our every move.

**Let’s assume that all of Harry's activities are secretly being collected by the same third party; in their eyes, Harry's profile might look like this:**


![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*V1q2Ju6ItSSy80NvScD16Q.png)


On the left are personal details, possibly from website registration data and delivery information; on the right are behavior and interest tags based on Harry's activity records.


![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*G71DeU1FmX75U2HGaDy-yg.png)


In their view, they might understand Harry better than Harry understands himself; this data used on social media can lead users to become more addicted; used in advertising, it can stimulate Harry to overspend or create a "birdcage effect" \(e\.g\. recommending he buy new pants, after which he buys shoes to match, and then socks… endlessly\).

**If you think the above is already scary, there’s something even more frightening:**


![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*OctTSsyFfaZc1OdaBjLN5g.png)


Having your personal information and knowing your financial situation… the potential for malicious actions is unimaginable, such as: kidnapping, theft…
#### Current Privacy Protection Methods
- Legal regulations \(e\.g\. SGS-BS10012 personal data certification, CCPA, GDPR, etc.\)
- Privacy agreements, de-identification

Mainly through regulatory constraints; it is difficult to ensure that services comply 100% at all times, and there are many malicious programs online, making it hard to guarantee that services won't be hacked, leading to data breaches; in short, " **if someone wants to do harm, it is technically feasible, relying solely on regulations and corporate goodwill is insufficient**."

Moreover, more often than not, we are "forced" to accept privacy terms, unable to authorize individual privacy; we either have to forgo the entire service or use it while accepting all privacy terms; additionally, privacy terms are often opaque, leaving us unaware of how data will be collected and used, and we have no idea if a third party is secretly collecting our data without our knowledge.

Apple has also mentioned the personal privacy of minors, which is often collected by services without the consent of guardians.
### Apple’s Privacy Principles

After understanding the dangers of personal privacy leakage, let’s take a look at Apple's privacy principles.


![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*3GymtGipI60YZ8qSogRk1A.png)


Excerpted from the Apple Privacy White Paper, Apple's ideal is not to completely block but to find a balance; for example, many people have installed AD Blockers to completely block ads, which is not what Apple wants to see; because if everything is completely cut off, it becomes difficult to provide better services.

Steve Jobs mentioned at the 2010 [All Things Digital Conference](https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/27/technology/steve-jobs-mark-zuckerberg-privacy-2010/index.html){:target="_blank"}:


> _I believe people are smart; some people want to share data more than others. Asking them every time will annoy them to the point where they tell you to stop asking, and they should know precisely how you will use their data. —_ translated by [Chun-Hsiu Liu](https://medium.com/u/72361fccaa43){:target="_blank"} 






![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*i7LbId4pPABbu5GkUXZeHw.png)



> _Apple believes that privacy is a fundamental human right._ 




#### **Apple's Four Privacy Principles:**
- Data Minimization: Only collect the data you need.
- On-Device Processing: Apple, based on powerful processor chips, should execute personal privacy-related data locally unless necessary.
- User Transparency and Control: Allow users to understand what privacy information is collected and how it is used; also, users should be able to control individual privacy data sharing switches.
- Security: Ensure the security of data storage and transmission.

### iOS's Functional Adjustments Over the Years to Protect Personal Privacy

Having understood the dangers of personal privacy leakage and Apple's privacy principles, let's return to the technical measures; we can look at the functional adjustments made in iOS over the years to protect personal privacy.
### Between Websites

As mentioned earlier,
#### **The first method can use Third-Party Cookies to connect visitor data across websites:**


> **_🈲, Intelligent Tracking Prevention has been implemented in Safari since iOS >= 11 \( [WebKit](https://webkit.org/blog/7675/intelligent-tracking-prevention/){:target="_blank"} \)_** 



```markdown
---
default: true
---

By default, browsers actively identify and block third-party cookies used for tracking and advertising. Each year, the iOS version continues to enhance its identification programs to prevent any oversights.

![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*qlan3n0rzMDRpKsCBXnfSQ.png)

The method of cross-site tracking users through third-party cookies is essentially no longer viable on Safari.
#### **The second method is to use IP Address + device information to calculate a fingerprint to identify the same browser across different websites:**

> **_🈲, iOS >= 15 Private Relay_**

Especially after third-party cookies were banned, more and more services have adopted this method, and Apple is aware of it... Fortunately, in iOS 15, even IP information is obfuscated!

![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*4xwPyZo24dZL_B6vuGwbMw.png)

The Private Relay service sends the user's original request randomly to Apple's Ingress Proxy, which then randomly assigns it to a partner CDN's Egress Proxy, which then requests the target website.

The entire process is encrypted, and only the chip in your iPhone can decrypt it. Only you know both your IP and the target website of the request; Apple's Ingress Proxy only knows your IP, the CDN's Egress Proxy only knows the IP of Apple's Ingress Proxy and the target website, and the website only knows the IP of the CDN's Egress Proxy.

From an application perspective, all devices in the same region will use the same shared CDN's Egress Proxy IP to request the target website; therefore, the website can no longer use IP as fingerprint information.

For technical details, refer to “[WWDC 2021 — Get ready for iCloud Private Relay](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10096/){:target="_blank"}”.
#### **Additional Information on Private Relay:**
- Apple/CDN Provider does not have complete logs for tracing:
I looked into how Apple prevents this from being used maliciously, but couldn't find an answer; it might be similar to how Apple won't unlock a criminal's iPhone for the FBI; privacy is a fundamental human right for everyone.
- Enabled by default, no special connection required
- Does not affect speed or performance
- **IP will be guaranteed to be in the same country and time zone** (users can choose a blurred city), cannot specify IP
- **Only effective for certain traffic**
iCloud+ users: All traffic on Safari + insecure HTTP requests in apps
General users: Only effective for third-party tracking tools installed on websites in Safari
- **Officially provides a [CDN Egress IP List](https://mask-api.icloud.com/egress-ip-ranges.csv){:target="_blank"} for website developers to identify (do not mistakenly block Egress IP, as it will cause collective harm)**
- [Network administrators can ban DNS to disable Private Relay for all connections](https://developer.apple.com/support/prepare-your-network-for-icloud-private-relay/){:target="_blank"}
- iPhone can disable Private Relay for specific network connections
- Private Relay will be disabled when connecting to VPN/proxy
- Currently still in beta (as of 2021/10/24), some services may not connect after enabling (in China, Chinese version of Douyin) or services may frequently log out

![Private Relay Test Image](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*Abc_bFGsL-dUeUSVeAVBxg.jpeg)

Private Relay Test Image
- Image 1 Not Enabled: Original IP Address
- Image 2 Enabled Private Relay — Maintains General Location: IP changes to CDN IP but remains in Taipei
- Image 3 Enabled Private Relay — Uses Country and Time Zone (Expanded Blurring): IP changes to CDN IP & changes to Taichung, but still in the same time zone and country

![[Test Project](https://github.com/zhgchgli0718/PrivacyTest){:target="_blank"}](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*ZDX3oYcoHwSh0Lkb1g1X_g.png)

[Test Project](https://github.com/zhgchgli0718/PrivacyTest){:target="_blank"}

Apps can use `URLSessionTaskMetrics` to analyze the connection records of Private Relay.

![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*aMr5w1sZN-ewFEtcNxLcPA.png)

To digress, the method of obtaining a fingerprint using IP addresses to identify users can no longer be used.
### Between Apps
#### **The first method was to directly access Device UUID in earlier versions:**

> **_🈲, iOS >= 7 prohibits access to Device UUID,_**

> **_Use IdentifierForAdvertisers/IdentifierForVendor instead_**

![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*XYD2LWx6gZ5c-iEmm_G2pQ.png)

- **IDFV:** All apps under the same developer account can access the same UUID; [when paired with KeyChain, it is also a current method for identifying user UUID](../a4bc3bce7513/).
- **IDFA:** Different developers and different apps can access the same UUID, but IDFA users can reset or disable it.

> **_🈲, iOS >= 14.5 IdentifierForAdvertisers requires permission to use_**

![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*KCdE18ucjjUnwPzb7gpa5A.png)

After iOS 14.5, Apple strengthened the restrictions on accessing IDFA; apps must first ask users for permission to track before they can obtain the IDFA UUID. If permission is not asked or granted, no value can be obtained.

Initial survey data indicates that about 70% of users (latest data suggests 90%) do not allow tracking to access IDFA, which is why people say IDFA is dead!

![[Test Project](https://github.com/zhgchgli0718/PrivacyTest){:target="_blank"}](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*Dz-GYDKsdXQal_PausrHMA.png)

[Test Project](https://github.com/zhgchgli0718/PrivacyTest){:target="_blank"}
#### **The second method for communication between apps is URL Scheme:**

iOS apps can use `canOpenURL` to detect whether a specific app is installed on the user's phone.

> **_🈲, iOS >= 9 must be set up in the app before use; cannot be used arbitrarily._**

![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*eapZObP6QN6-g_Z1Nd7hZA.png)

> **_iOS ≥ 15 introduces a limit of a maximum of 50 entries for other app schemes._**

> _`Apps linked on or after iOS 15 are limited to a maximum of 50 entries in the LSApplicationQueriesSchemes key.`_

### Between Websites and Apps

**As previously mentioned**
#### **The first method is also through cookies for connection:**

In earlier versions, cookies from iOS Safari and App WebView could communicate, allowing data to be shared between websites and apps.

The method involved stealthily inserting a 1-pixel WebView component in the background of the app to read Safari cookies.

> **_🈲, iOS >= 11 prohibits sharing cookies between Safari and App WebView_**

![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*sCY5ejSzJjNLDZucbsWV8w.png)

If there is a need to obtain Safari cookies (e.g., logging in directly using website cookies), the `SFSafariViewController` component can be used; however, this component forces a prompt window and cannot be customized, ensuring that users are not inadvertently having their cookies stolen.
#### **The second method is to identify the same browser across different websites using IP Address + device information to calculate a fingerprint:**

As mentioned earlier, iOS ≥ 15 has been obfuscated by Private Relay.
#### **The last and only remaining method — Pasteboard:**

Using the clipboard to connect cross-platform information, as Apple cannot disable clipboard use across apps, but it can prompt users.

> **_⚠️ iOS >= 14 introduces clipboard access warnings_**

![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*TdsFfW6axWx3nbB1Thaucw.png)

#### ⚠️ 2022/07/22 Update: iOS 16 Upcoming Changes

Starting from iOS ≥ 16, when an app actively reads the clipboard without user-initiated paste actions, a prompt window will appear, and users must press allow for the app to read clipboard information.

![[UIPasteBoard’s privacy change in iOS 16](https://sarunw.com/posts/uipasteboard-privacy-change-ios16/){:target="_blank"}](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*2LpAXuZduLStmS2tRVdcXQ.png)

[UIPasteBoard’s privacy change in iOS 16](https://sarunw.com/posts/uipasteboard-privacy-change-ios16/){:target="_blank"}
#### **Using Pasteboard to Implement Deferred Deep Link**

> **_I want to mention the privacy panic regarding the clipboard in iOS 14; for details, refer to my previous article “[iOS 14 Clipboard Data Theft Panic, The Dilemma of Privacy and Convenience](../8a04443024e2/)”_**

Although it cannot be ruled out that reading the clipboard is for data theft, more often, our app needs to provide a better user experience:

![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*lZMyzL6Pmy06lng8PWMk0w.png)

Before implementing Deferred Deep Link, when we guide users to install the app from the website, upon installation, the app would default to opening the homepage; a better user experience should be to open the app to the corresponding page where the webpage was left off.

To achieve this functionality, there needs to be an opportunity to share data between the website and the app, as the other methods mentioned earlier have been banned, and currently, the clipboard is the only medium for storing information (as shown above).

![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*jVytiPiHhaubihaHSDYBNA.png)

Including Firebase Dynamic Links and the latest version of Branch.io (which previously used IP Address Fingerprint) also use the clipboard for Deferred Deep Link.

For implementation details, refer to my previous article: [iOS Deferred Deep Link Implementation (Swift)](../b08ef940c196/)

> _Generally, if the goal is to achieve Deferred Deep Link, the clipboard information will only be read the first time the app is opened or when returning to the app; it will not be read during use or at strange times, which is worth noting._

A better approach is to first use `UIPasteboard.general.detectPatterns` to detect whether the clipboard data is what we need before reading it.

![[Test Project](https://github.com/zhgchgli0718/PrivacyTest){:target="_blank"}](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*7Kyfq0LT1mkPAFxwkmpMRQ.png)

[Test Project](https://github.com/zhgchgli0718/PrivacyTest){:target="_blank"}

After iOS ≥ 15, clipboard prompts have been optimized; if it is the user's own paste action, no prompt will appear!
### Advertising Effect Solutions

As previously mentioned, Apple's privacy principles aim for balance rather than completely blocking user-service interactions.
#### **Advertising Effect Statistics Between Websites:**

Safari's equivalent to blocking Intelligent Tracking Prevention is Private Click Measurement ([WebKit](https://webkit.org/blog/11529/introducing-private-click-measurement-pcm/){:target="_blank"}) used to measure advertising effectiveness while removing personal privacy.

![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*a9DibQQDW9QgiPxt3Y--SQ.png)

The specific process is illustrated in the image above; when a user clicks an ad on website A to go to website B, a Source ID (to identify the same user) and Destination information (target website) will be recorded in the browser. When the user completes a conversion on website B, a Trigger ID (representing what action) will also be recorded in the browser.

![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*n2PwE4AMOPAqvTI-FcNdRQ.png)

These two pieces of information will be combined and sent to websites A and B randomly after 24 to 48 hours to obtain advertising effectiveness.

Everything is handled on-device by Safari, and protection against malicious clicks is also provided by Safari.
#### **Advertising Effect Statistics Between Apps and Websites or Apps:**

![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*jUObXccBCf4dB7ZU_yn-EQ.png)

You can use [SKAdNetwork](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skadnetwork){:target="_blank"} (requires application to Apple) in a manner similar to Private Click Measurement, which will not be elaborated further.

> _It is worth mentioning that Apple is not working in isolation; [SKAdNetwork](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skadnetwork){:target="_blank"} is currently at version 2.0, and Apple continues to gather developer and advertiser needs while balancing personal privacy controls, continuously optimizing SDK functionality._

> _I sincerely hope that Deferred Deep Link can be connected through SDK, as we aim to enhance user experience without intending to infringe on personal privacy._

For technical details, refer to “[WWDC 2021 — Meet privacy-preserving ad attribution](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10033/){:target="_blank"}”.
### Cross-Platform

![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*fWuWfmUzOZ2w2iI1FrzwRA.png)

> **_iOS ≥ 13 requires all apps supporting third-party login to implement Sign in with Apple; otherwise, the app cannot be successfully listed_**

- Name can be edited by the user
- Real email can be hidden (using a virtual email generated by Apple instead)
- Users can request account deletion [**by 2022/01/31, apps must complete implementation**](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=mdkbobfo){:target="_blank"} 🆕

![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*AzjnZmNm6eqG72bVw8iKag.png)

> **_iOS >= 15 iCloud+ users support Hide My Email_**

- Supports all email fields in Safari and apps
- Users can generate virtual email addresses at will in settings

Similar to Sign in with Apple, using a virtual email generated by Apple instead of a real email, when receiving emails, Apple will forward them to your real email, thus protecting your email information.

It is like a 10-minute email but even more powerful; as long as you keep using it, that virtual email address is permanently yours; there is no limit on new additions, and it is uncertain how Apple prevents abuse.

### Others
#### **App privacy details on the App Store:**

> [_Apps must explain to users what data will be tracked and how it will be used on the App Store_](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/){:target="_blank"} _.

Detailed explanations can be found in: “[App privacy details on the App Store](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/){:target="_blank"}”.
#### **Fine Control of Personal Privacy Data:**

![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*qZF5DvQx6RTIggWS7Be4Bw.png)

> _Starting from iOS ≥ 14, location and photo access can be controlled more finely, allowing authorization for only certain photos or only allowing location access while the app is in use._

> _In iOS ≥ 15, the [CLLocationButton](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocationui/cllocationbutton){:target="_blank"} button was added to enhance user experience, allowing the current location to be obtained through user clicks without asking for permission/consent; this button cannot be customized and can only be triggered by user action._
```

#### **Personal Privacy Access Prompt:**

> _iOS ≥ 15 introduces prompts for accessing personal privacy features, such as: clipboard, location, camera, and microphone._ 




#### **App Privacy Access Report:**


> _iOS ≥ 15 allows you to export a report of all privacy-related access and network activity of apps on your phone over the past 7 days._ 




1. Since the report file is a `.ndjson` plain text file, it can be difficult to view directly; you can first download the "[Privacy Insights](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/%E9%9A%B1%E7%A7%98%E6%B4%9E%E8%A6%8B-app-privacy-insights/id1575583991){:target="_blank"}" app from the App Store to view the report.
2. Go to Settings -> Privacy -> Scroll down to "Record App Activity" -> Enable Record App Activity.
3. Save App Activity.
4. Choose "Import to [Privacy Insights](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/%E9%9A%B1%E7%A7%98%E6%B4%9E%E8%A6%8B-app-privacy-insights/id1575583991){:target="_blank"}."
5. After the import is complete, you can view the privacy report.

As mentioned in the [news](https://technews.tw/2021/10/12/china-app-reads-iphone-user-album-data/){:target="_blank"}, WeChat indeed reads photo information in the background when the app is launched.


> **_Additionally, I have caught several other Chinese apps doing the same, so I have disabled all their permissions in settings._** 
 

> **_If it weren't for this feature exposing them, we wouldn't know how long our data has been at risk of theft!_** 




### Recap
#### Apple’s Privacy Principles


![](/assets/9a05f632eba0/1*YUtG3sEQMvu8433VD5j8WA.png)


After understanding the adjustments made to privacy features over the years, let's revisit Apple's privacy principles:
- Data Minimization: Apple uses technical means to limit the data accessed.
- On-Device Processing: Privacy data is not uploaded to the cloud; everything is processed locally. For example, Safari Private Click Measurement, Apple's [Machine Learning SDK CoreML](../793bf2cdda0f/), Siri/text recognition features in iOS ≥ 15, Apple Maps, News, photo recognition features, etc.
- User Transparency and Control: New privacy access prompts, record reports, and fine-grained privacy control features.
- Security: Secure storage and transmission of data, avoiding misuse of UserDefaults, and iOS 15 allows direct use of CryptoKit for point-to-point encryption and decryption, ensuring transmission security with Private Relay.

#### Fragmented Data

Returning to the initial technical means used to piece together Harry's association map, the connections between websites or apps have been blocked, leaving only the clipboard functional, but with prompts.

For service registrations and third-party logins, you can use Sign in with Apple and the Hide My Email feature for protection; or use more native iOS apps.

For offline activities, perhaps using Apple Card can prevent privacy leaks?


> **_No one will have the opportunity to piece together Harry's activity profile anymore._** 




#### Apple is Human-Centric

Thus, "human-centric" is the term I would use to describe Apple's philosophy. It takes a strong belief to go against the commercial market; related to this, "technology-centric" is the term I would use for Google, as they consistently produce many geeky tech projects; finally, "business-centric" is the term I would use for Facebook, as FB primarily pursues commercial profits on many levels.

In addition to adjustments to privacy features, iOS has continuously strengthened features to prevent smartphone addiction over the years, introducing "Screen Time Reports," "App Usage Limits," "Focus Mode," and more; helping everyone break free from smartphone addiction.
### Lastly, I hope everyone can
- **Value personal privacy**
- **Not be controlled by capital**
- **Reduce virtual addiction**
- **Prevent societal decline**



> **_Live a wonderful life in the real world!_**
