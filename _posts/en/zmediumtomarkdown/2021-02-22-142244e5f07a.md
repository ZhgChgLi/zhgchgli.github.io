### Introduction

A few years ago, while still supporting web development, I was assigned the task of organizing a CTF competition for the internal engineering team; initially, I thought of organizing teams based on the company's products for mutual attack and defense. However, as the organizer, I wanted to understand the level of knowledge first, so I conducted penetration tests on the various products under the company; I wanted to see how many vulnerabilities I could find myself to ensure that the event would run smoothly.


> _However, due to the limited time for the competition and the significant differences in engineering areas, I ultimately decided to create questions based on common foundational knowledge and interesting directions. Interested friends can refer to my previous article "[**How to Create an Interesting Engineering CTF Competition**](../729d7b6817a4/)"; it contains many creative questions!_ 




### Vulnerabilities Found

A total of four vulnerabilities were found across three products. In addition to the issues mentioned in this article, I also discovered the following three common website vulnerabilities:
1. **Never Trust The Client!** 
This is a basic issue where the frontend directly sends the ID to the backend, and the backend accepts it directly; this should be changed to accept a Token.
2. **Password Reset Design Flaw** 
I actually forgot the specifics, but I remember it was a design flaw in the program; it allowed the password reset process to bypass email verification.
3. **XSS Issue**
4. **The vulnerability discussed in this article**


The search method was strictly black-box testing, and the only product where I found the XSS issue was one I had participated in developing; I had no involvement with the others and had not seen their code.
### Current Status of Vulnerabilities

As a white-hat hacker, all the issues I found were reported to the engineering team immediately and have been fixed; now that two years have passed, I think it's time to make this public. However, considering the position of my former company, this article will not mention which product had this vulnerability; everyone can just refer to the process and reasons for discovering this vulnerability!
### Consequences of the Vulnerability

This vulnerability allows an attacker to change the target user's password at will and log in to the target user's account with the new password, stealing personal data and engaging in illegal activities.
### Main Causes of the Vulnerability

As the title suggests, this vulnerability is triggered by a combination of multiple factors, including:
- Account login does not support two-factor authentication or device binding
- Password reset verification uses a serial number
- The website's data encryption feature has a decryption vulnerability
- Misuse of encryption and decryption functions
- Incorrect design of the verification token
- The backend does not re-verify the correctness of the fields
- User email on the platform is public information

### Steps to Reproduce the Vulnerability


![](/assets/142244e5f07a/1*ILb0VdnkAvgH5aW7qos_lg.png)


Since user emails on the platform are public information, we first browse the target account to be attacked on the platform; after knowing the email, we go to the password reset page.
- First, enter your own email to perform the password reset operation
- Then, enter the email of the account you want to attack and perform the password reset operation again


Both of these operations will send a password reset verification email.

Go to your own email inbox to receive the password reset verification email.

**The password change link is in the following URL format:**
```
https://zhgchg.li/resetPassword.php?auth=PvrrbQWBGDQ3LeSBByd
```

`PvrrbQWBGDQ3LeSBByd` is the verification token for this password reset operation.

However, while observing the verification code image on the website, I found that the link format for the verification code image is also similar:
```
https://zhgchg.li/captchaImage.php?auth=6EqfSZLqDc
```

```markdown
![](/assets/142244e5f07a/1*nfAhh3QasOLCDxdxH5jEQg.png)

`6EqfSZLqDc` shows `5136`.

So what happens if we plug our password reset token in? Who cares! **Letâ€™s try it!**

> Bingo\!

But the verification code image is too small to get complete information.

**Letâ€™s keep looking for exploitable pointsâ€¦**

Coincidentally, the website prevents web scraping by displaying users' public email addresses as **images**, keyword: **image representation! image representation! image representation!**

Letâ€™s open it up and take a look:

Profile Page

![Webpage Source Code Part](/assets/142244e5f07a/1*cb0Rpz_Zuto5e6WTPsA_Tw.png)

Webpage Source Code Part

We also got a similar URL format result:
```
https://zhgchg.li/mailImage.php?mail=V3sDblZgDGdUOOBlBjpRblMTDGwMbwFmUT10bFN6DDlVbAVt
```

`V3sDblZgDGdUOOBlBjpRblMTDGwMbwFmUT10bFN6DDlVbAVt` shows `zhgchgli@gmail.com`

**Who cares! Letâ€™s blast it!**

> Bingo\!ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

> `PvrrbQWBGDQ3LeSBByd` _= `2395656`_

#### **After decoding the reset password token and discovering itâ€™s a serial number**

I thought, could it be a serial number...

So I entered the email again to request a password reset, decoded the new token from the received email, and got `2395657`â€¦ what the fxckâ€¦ it really is.

Once I knew it was a serial number, things became easier, which is why the initial operation was to first request a password reset email for my own account, then for the target I wanted to hack; because I could already predict the next password request ID.

> **_Next, I just need to find a way to convert `2395657` back to the token!_**

#### Coincidentally, I discovered another issue

> **_The website only performs front-end validation for the email format during data editing, and there is no secondary validation on the back endâ€¦_**

After bypassing the front-end validation, I changed the email to the next target.

> Fire in the hole!

**We got:**
```
https://zhgchg.li/mailImage.php?mail=UTVRZwZuDjMNPLZhBGI
```

**At this point, we take this password reset token back to the password reset page:**

![](/assets/142244e5f07a/1*1kZp5LQ1yT6m7IBJLoYj9Q.png)

> Invasion successful! Bypassed verification to reset someone else's password!

In the end, due to the lack of two-factor login protection and device binding features; once the password was overwritten, I could log in directly and impersonate them.

### The Reason Behind It

Letâ€™s recap the entire process.
- Initially, we wanted to reset the password, but found that the reset token was actually a serial number, not a true unique identifier token.
- The website misuses encryption and decryption functions, not distinguishing between different functionalities; almost the entire site uses the same set.
- The website has an online arbitrary encryption and decryption entry (equivalent to key compromise).
- The back end does not perform secondary validation on user input.
- There is no two-factor login protection or device binding feature.

#### Correction Methods
- Fundamentally, the reset password token should be a randomly generated unique identifier token.
- The website's encryption and decryption parts should use different keys for different functionalities.
- Prevent external arbitrary operations on data encryption and decryption.
- The back end should validate user input.
- To be safe, add two-factor login protection and device binding features.

### Summary

The entire journey of discovering the vulnerability surprised me, as many were basic design issues; although the functionality seems to work at first glance, with minor holes it still appears relatively secure; but multiple small holes combined can create a big one, so developers really need to be cautious and meticulous.
