### \[Travel Journal\] 2023 Sanyo Region Hiroshima Okayama 6-Day Free Trip

2023 6-Day Trip to Hiroshima, Okayama, Fukuyama, Kurashiki, Onomichi

### Introduction

After resigning at the end of August, I set off in September for a " [10-Day Solo Trip in Kyushu](../d78e0b15a08a/) ". After resting for almost three months, I originally planned to start my new job in mid-November. Once I started, I would have to embark on new projects, and since the new company doesn't offer much vacation time, I would need to accumulate annual leave according to basic labor laws. Therefore, I considered going out to play again (planning started at the end of October).
#### 2024/11/03 Update:
- [\[Travel Journal\] 2024 San'in Region ( + Kansai) Shimane Tottori Himeji Osaka 7-Day Solo Trip](../aacd5f5cacd1/)

In 2024, I went to the San'in region, and friends with time can also consider combining Sanyo and San'in for a trip!
#### Location — Hiroshima (Okayama)

Last time I went to [Nagasaki, there was a **surprising little episode**](../d78e0b15a08a/) — I got a souvenir from Mihara City in **Hiroshima Prefecture**. Plus, I visited the Atomic Bomb Memorial Museum and Peace Park in Nagasaki, so I thought I could check out **Hiroshima** as well.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/0*RZlVO1fuMs6au4Ij.jpeg)

Moreover, friends around me also recommended **Hiroshima**, which has world heritage sites — Itsukushima Shrine, oysters, the Seto Inland Sea, Onomichi, and Rabbit Island…

Since I am also traveling solo, I do not want to consider big cities or places I have already visited, and I hope for convenient transportation, **Hiroshima** is a great choice!
#### Dates — 11/13–18

I originally planned to start work on 11/20 (Monday) (later postponed to 12/1), and after deducting the last day for buffer rest, I booked my return date for 11/18 (Saturday).

For the outbound date, I initially had plans with friends on 11/12, so I aimed to depart on 11/13 (Monday); however, since I hadn't started work yet, the arrangements were quite flexible, mainly depending on when the flight prices were lower for round trips.
#### A Series of Twists and Turns

**❌ The most intuitive way to go to Hiroshima is to fly in and out of Hiroshima Airport, but the conditions are very unfavorable:**
- Time: Arriving late (17:20) and returning early (09:30); and there are no flights on Saturday, so I would have to return on Friday (11/17).
- Location: Requires taking a shuttle bus (about 55 minutes), and after landing, I can only take the last bus at 21:40 or 22:20, arriving at the station around 22 or 23 o'clock, which is very late.
- Price: ~=$17,000, too expensive.

**❌ Flying in and out of Fukuoka + Shinkansen is still inconvenient:**
- Time: Departing at (16:30) and returning at (10:55), also late arrival and early return, but slightly better.
- Location: Convenient transportation, but I need to add about 1.5 hours for the Shinkansen to Hiroshima.
- Price: ~=$12,000; if I want to return late (20:35), it would be ~=$17,000 or take an early morning flight at 06:50.

**❌ I later found out that I could fly in and out of Okayama with Tigerair, which had a decent schedule:**
- Time: Departing at (11:10) and returning at (15:25), which is great timing.
- Location: Okayama Airport also requires taking a shuttle bus, but the landing time is early, allowing for ample time.
- Price: Including a +20 KG checked bag, the round trip is about ~= $14,000.

Since I had just spent money on the " [10 Days in Kyushu](../d78e0b15a08a/) " trip in September, if the flight prices couldn't be kept around 10,000, I was not very motivated to go, so I was almost ready to give up on this trip.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Agd-DC4jUc5xcvez71cIVw.png)

On 10/31, while scrolling through Facebook, I happened to see a post in the " [Japan Free Travel Discussion Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/207266832755595/){:target="_blank"} " about airline discounts. I saw that [Tigerair](https://static.tigerairtw.com/www/events/OKJ23winter/index.html){:target="_blank"} had a promotion from 11/3 10:00 to 11/6 23:59; fortunately, I approached it with a laid-back attitude, and if I could get the discount, I would go, otherwise, it would be fine.


On the morning of November 3rd, I was lucky enough to buy the best round-trip tickets (November 13–18), with the best flight times and prices, so there was no reason not to go!

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*e7BeYsY5ov6J25hlOr2Wqw.png)

- Departing at \(11:10\), returning at \(15:25\), including 20KG checked baggage for round trip + seat selection + miscellaneous fees: **$7,012**

### Preparations

After purchasing the tickets, there is only one week left until departure, so I immediately started preparing.

I plan to visit Miyajima, Onomichi, Kurashiki Bikan Historical Area, and Okayama Castle; therefore, I will use Hiroshima as my base to stay for several days, and closer to the return trip, I will stay around Okayama.
#### Travel

[JR Pass Okayama & Hiroshima & Yamaguchi Area Railway Pass](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20311-jr-okayama-hiroshima-yamaguchi-area-pass?cid=19365&ud1=31b9b3a63abc){:target="_blank"} (¥ 17,000, just in time for the price increase at the end of October 2023.)

The one-way fare to Okayama is ¥6,460, round trip ¥12,920; considering the trips to Miyajima, Onomichi, and Kure... it should be worth it; buying the JR Pass is the most convenient option.
#### Accommodation (5 nights)

[**Toyoko Inn Hiroshima Station Baseball Stadium Front**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sm8WnCdTk2qf2VgCA){:target="_blank"} **(3 nights)**

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*-YwLmHr8op_lrrQY3SCd2g.png)

- Price: $4,612, $1,537/night, single non-smoking room
- Transportation: It looks quite close on the map (it actually takes about 15 minutes to walk because of construction and having to cross a level crossing), and it’s not a lively area, located outside the Mazda Zoom-Zoom Stadium, which is quiet since there are no games currently.

Toyoko Inn consistently offers great value for money, with both price and environment being the best for this stay.

[**APA Hotel Hiroshima Station Front Bridge**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dSk4agNLsMDA638Z9){:target="_blank"} **(1 night)**

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*wt4pri9pUzkFiUZzZIgWOQ.png)

- Price: $2,501, 1 night, single non-smoking room
- Location: Closer to Hiroshima Station, but it’s not easy to walk; you have to cross a major road and a bridge (about 10 minutes); it takes about 15 minutes to walk from the previous accommodation, which is relatively convenient.

因東橫 INN 訂不到四晚，只能一晚住 APA 飯店。

[**Livemax Okayama Kurashiki Station Front Hotel**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pcPAvCaaH4mzo36o6){:target="_blank"} **Livemax (1 night)**

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*F5rO356jsxQwugfbxANN8w.png)

- Price: $3,263, 1 night, single non-smoking room
- Location: Similar to the map, just outside Kurashiki Station, about a five-minute walk, very convenient.

I found Kurashiki because I couldn't book a hotel in Okayama at an acceptable price, so I had to look for accommodations along the JR line, as Kurashiki also has a shuttle back to Okayama Airport; thus, I decided to find a hotel near Kurashiki.

This hotel is also the only one in Kurashiki that still has rooms available, is conveniently located, and has a price that is acceptable.
#### Fun

The original plan was as follows:
- 11/13: Shopping, eating Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki
- 11/14: Miyajima, Hiroshima City: Itsukushima Shrine, Momijidani Park, Miyajima Ropeway -> Shishiiwa Observatory, Atomic Bomb Dome, Peace Memorial Park, Atomic Bomb Museum, Paper Crane Tower (Hiroshima Tower)
- 11/15: Onomichi, Senkoji Temple
- 11/16: Kure City, Hiroshima City (same as 11/14), Hiroshima Castle
- 11/17: Okayama, Kurashiki: Okayama Korakuen, Okayama Castle, Kibitsu Shrine, Kurashiki Bikan Historical Area, Kurashiki Outlet, Achi Shrine
- 11/18: Kurashiki Outlet, return trip

Rabbit Island is too far and inconvenient, so it's only on the reference list.
#### Go!

### Day 1 Departure

Departing at 11:10 AM, slowly heading out in the morning.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*yeEzGfYKPOkgTloqwikhmg.jpeg)

Taking the Airport MRT from Taipei Main Station to Taoyuan Airport Terminal 1, arriving at the check-in counter around 08:50.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*JC4MGzSm0SyDbYDdU8SfvA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*224m8Mrtd6cq_NtNa1nE0w.jpeg)

There weren't many people, so check-in and immigration were completed quickly; [Terminal 1](https://web.taoyuan-airport.com/services_facilities?p=1&m=9CBEA40D-B7AB-EB11-AB4D-D45D6481BBEB&t=1&a=2){:target="_blank"} doesn't have much to eat, so I casually bought some fried chicken and coffee before heading to the boarding area.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Wm_YG0rPckM1iq_uUQ2Lgg.jpeg)

I wasn't very hungry while waiting, so I didn't eat the purchased items.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*tE1ZkTG7TalQrmr3bsegUw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*lgXM2X4L-OXwTiEMpAi8Ug.jpeg)

Departing at 11:07, arriving at OKJ (Okayama Momotaro Airport) at 14:11; during the flight, I realized that Tigerair does not allow bringing your own food on board (Peach Aviation has no specific regulations), so I just held back, thinking I would eat in a corner before going through immigration.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*_zm48DE_q-bLr7FnUJPcEw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*-SpeO3_twTbSibfVz4TufQ.jpeg)

Okayama Airport is super small; I just followed the crowd and went straight through immigration, with no corner to sneak a snack; since I was worried about pandemic issues with the fried chicken, I handed the whole bag to customs for disposal.

By around 14:40, I had completed immigration and picked up my luggage (super fast). Later, I checked the flight schedule, and there are very few flights from Okayama Airport; international flights might only have one a day, so there were hardly any people, just those on the same flight; customs and the quarantine dog checked each person, but it was still very quick!

Once outside, I directly boarded the airport shuttle; perhaps due to the few flights, according to the schedule, I would have to wait until **16:10** for a shuttle to Okayama Station; however, there was an additional shuttle available right after exiting the airport (it departs when full, and there will be another one), which was very considerate and saved everyone time!

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*JAe4i7XdyYcjdsQkjRDzwQ.png)

After getting off, I found the escalator to go up to Okayama Station, first to exchange my JR Pass, locating the machine with the green sign that says "**EXPRESS予約、5489 お受取**" to redeem the JR Pass ticket.


Previously, I found a [redemption tutorial](https://icepanda74.com/jr-west-pass/){:target="_blank"} online, which mentioned clicking the blue "予約したきっぷのお受取り" button. However, when I followed the steps and scanned the QR Code, I kept getting a "QR Code invalid" error. Trying to input the order number also failed.

Finally, after multiple attempts among a group of Taiwanese people, we discovered that we needed to use the yellow button " **QRコードの読取り** " in the lower left corner for redemption. After clicking it, we could directly scan the QR Code. (I suspect the JR machines have been updated.)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*q7bTApvhtGL0JL1NIDoFDA.png)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*iWb8VSdUEYDonDQ6GDfmXQ.png)

The machine dispenses two instruction sheets and **one JR Pass (the ticket marked with ✔ in the image)**. You can also insert the JR Pass later to [complete the reservation](../d78e0b15a08a/). **The entry and exit are done using the JR Pass ticket**, while the reservation ticket is only for reference regarding seats and times; it cannot be used for entry and exit.

I was really hungry and hadn't eaten anything, so I went to a convenience store to buy something to fill my stomach, thus purchasing JR tickets for the later trains.

I arrived at Hiroshima Station around 16:45.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*oL8_C5_VSGO6QKeHnCbGOQ.jpeg)

First, I checked into the hotel to drop off my luggage before heading out to find food. This road was quite deserted without a baseball game happening; across the street was the railway, and there weren't many shops, but fortunately, there was a large Lawson convenience store.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*2SoIwTR9QF8c2jKioGaPYg.jpeg)

![[Hiroshima Okonomiyaki Station Front Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C8aLTG48rhfKwVQz6){:target="_blank"}](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*mIjh2c9lqbNQm1dug1HcrA.png)

[Hiroshima Okonomiyaki Station Front Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C8aLTG48rhfKwVQz6){:target="_blank"}

I returned to the station to eat Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki at "[Hiroshima Okonomiyaki Station Front Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C8aLTG48rhfKwVQz6){:target="_blank"}," located on the right side after exiting Hiroshima Station on the 6th floor (next to Ekie department store). As soon as I stepped out of the elevator, I felt it was special; the entire floor was filled with okonomiyaki restaurants, allowing you to choose your favorite place to sit.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*31Pe4NiL7DBIaWdh-wbF-g.jpeg)

I ordered an okonomiyaki with added rice cakes (which contained fried noodles) and found the taste to be average. It had noodles and rice cakes inside, and I felt very full after finishing it.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*jpewRa0A3jICE1rJHdi3bw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*3H1rWAQ3rCQMNqY8wPXO6w.jpeg)

On the way back to the hotel, I bought a late-night snack to eat. It was quite cold in Hiroshima at night, around 4 degrees.

Room unboxing.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*XQ38j0JGEvq6EbBB1VRA9g.jpeg)

When I opened the curtains, I could see the railway outside (about 10 tracks, so you need to cross the level crossing quickly); the downside of the room is that there is a clattering sound when the train passes by.
#### [Allite A1 65W GaN Fast Charger + Allite Liquid Silicone Fast Charging Cable](https://reurl.cc/67LEer){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*kZ-W5Rp-BGzJfHs_FoE9JQ.jpeg)

This trip I brought along the [Allite A1 65W GaN Fast Charger + Allite Liquid Silicone Fast Charging Cable](https://reurl.cc/67LEer){:target="_blank"} combination. Ever since switching to the iPhone 15, almost all my devices have switched to Type-C ports; when traveling, I only need to bring a Type-C charging cable to solve everything.

The [Allite A1 65W GaN Fast Charger](https://reurl.cc/67LEer){:target="_blank"} supports single-port 65W and dual-port 45W+18W fast charging. Its compact size makes it easy to carry around, and when I see a rechargeable outlet while out, I can plug it in for a quick charge. Back at the hotel, I can charge my power bank with one port and my phone, watch, iPad, or Switch with the other, making it convenient and fast.

The [Allite Liquid Silicone Fast Charging Cable](https://reurl.cc/67LEer){:target="_blank"} (1.5m) is long enough to use directly from a power bank while it's in my bag. The liquid silicone material is different from regular plastic; besides being skin-friendly, it is also easier to bend for storage and won't get deformed.

The best charging partner for this trip.
### Day 2 Miyajima (Itsukushima Shrine), Momijidani Park, Shishiiwa Observatory, Atomic Bomb Dome, Peace Memorial Park

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*09NEVdiOQ3PePi_cmthisA.jpeg)


In the morning, I took the JR train to Miyajimaguchi Station. After exiting, walk towards the pier to find the ferry station; the JR Pass includes the Miyajima ferry ticket, so there's no need to buy a separate ticket, but you will need to pay an additional [Miyajima visitation tax (¥100)](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E7%99%BB%E5%AE%AE%E5%B3%B6%E8%A8%AA%E5%9A%B4%E5%B3%B6%E7%A5%9E%E7%A4%BE-2023%E5%B9%B410%E6%9C%881%E6%97%A5%E8%B5%B7%E9%96%8B%E5%BE%B5%E8%A8%AA%E5%95%8F%E7%A8%85-045414147.html){:target="_blank"}, and there will be staff to guide you in purchasing the visitation tax ticket.


> You can also take the Hiroden to Miyajimaguchi, but I remember it takes longer. 





The ferry takes about 10 minutes to reach Miyajima. The ride is very smooth and doesn't have a diesel smell, and as we approach, you can see the torii gate from afar!

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*0-nFldh1yauKTKAhd2FVGw.jpeg)


Once on the island, head directly towards the sea torii gate. Taking photos along the shore is also beautiful and less crowded.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*4UzgS1ocwWemFhgzR4QMVA.jpeg)


After passing the Itsukushima Shrine, head to the Miyajima Ropeway to the Shishiiwa Observatory.

To reach the Lion Rock Observation Deck, you need to take two cable cars. The advantage of heading straight for the cable car is that there are almost no people (there are a lot of people at the Itsukushima Shrine below). The first segment is a small cable car that accommodates a maximum of 6 people (it runs frequently and covers a longer distance), while the second segment is a larger cable car (if I remember correctly, it departs every 15 minutes and can hold more people (about 20), covering a shorter distance).

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*h_IfZzojUcGIsJ2eYWfyHQ.jpeg)

At the summit, you can overlook the entire Seto Inland Sea, enjoy the breeze, and gaze at the small islands, which is very pleasant.

The Itsukushima Shrine is directly built by the sea, with very clean water, creating a serene walking experience; you can also queue to take photos of the torii gate from the front.

During this season, the low tide occurs at 3 AM or 5 PM, so I missed the opportunity to see the low tide at the shrine and the torii gate this time.

For lunch, of course, we had oysters. The oyster rice and fried oysters at [Oyster House](https://tabelog.com/tw/hiroshima/A3402/A340202/34003363/){:target="_blank"} were both over 300 TWD, delicious and affordable, making me an oyster millionaire!

In the afternoon, I returned to Hiroshima city to stroll around the Atomic Bomb Dome and Peace Memorial Park.

In autumn, Hiroshima is adorned with the yellow of ginkgo leaves, the red of maple leaves, and some green leaves, complemented by the cool autumn breeze, reflecting on everything that has happened in Hiroshima.

> _I encountered many Japanese middle school students on outdoor educational trips at the Peace Memorial Park, with teachers explaining the history. It deeply impressed me how much the Japanese nation values the education of historical heritage._

#### Return to the Hotel

As evening approached, I returned to the hotel to rest because I was underdressed, and it was really cold outside.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*QZZruRDOmdJ37ziaWWYZqA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*p-9ReufIDYbzkqls7rd3GA.jpeg)

For dinner, I bought a takeout barbecue meal box from "[Sumiyaki Yakiniku Toshi Saruhashi Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C1hjH3o1KZe9bFFx7){:target="_blank"}" on the way back to the hotel; what initially caught my eye was the several charcoal grills placed at the entrance, which felt very warm as I walked by. I stopped to check the sign and found they offered takeout meal boxes, so I went in!

Another interesting feature was that their meal boxes had a self-heating function. When I got back to the hotel and wanted to eat, I just pulled a cord, and it would start heating itself, releasing hot steam; it felt like it was freshly made no matter when I ate it, which was very thoughtful.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*0RivogHw5D_eDTxmY4NZQQ.jpeg)

Tonight's convenience store late-night snack includes hot dogs, fried chicken, Strong Zero, and I also bought a bottle of Yakult Y1000, which claims to help you sleep well. (But after walking all day today, I was already quite sleepy.)

### Day 3: Onomichi, Senkoji Temple, Fukuyama, Tomonoura

In the morning, I took the Shinkansen to Mihara, and then transferred to a train to Onomichi Station.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*I0K5vrSgtXKMRsyIvntREw.jpeg)

I didn't manage my time well and ended up waiting for over 30 minutes when transferring from Mihara to Onomichi.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*z1Q4sDwaHmuCZ2-OoNR0uQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*XUwZTLkI5AGZ-cP5CCVKjg.jpeg)

I walked out of Onomichi Station through the south exit.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*y-OGrapaY37pTBGIRRwCXQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*CZHXhjDKmoJ28qU5PKJssA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*6CvXsywJ3wC3Mt7blFjpSw.jpeg)

With the nice weather and comfortable temperature, I headed straight to Senkoji Temple after leaving Onomichi Station. Walking on the mountain side felt a bit like walking in Jiufen, with a challenging path filled with many stairs and steep slopes. Looking to the other side, you can see the Seto Inland Sea, which offers a nice view.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*CB8z5W7Il8i-81CEkY1gGA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*1cMVbuqTv1_LkV-wLt4VDQ.jpeg)

Another option is to walk along the main road until you see the sign for the Senkoji cable car, where you can turn in and take the cable car directly up to Senkoji Temple.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*a3e3DRIScoHJ-e-WiGHUqg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*wWrh70gToooi2TxjDmlhCw.jpeg)

The view from Senkoji Temple is great, allowing you to overlook the entire Onomichi city area and the distant Onomichi Bridge.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*7ROiC17DN3oKK8zsV_fOHw.jpeg)

I brought home a cute little Jizo statue (you can choose to write a wish and leave it at Senkoji Temple for worship or take it home as a souvenir):

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*b7GU1RAZnLc4xL8scn6RSQ.png)

After visiting Senkoji Temple, I walked down to the Cat Alley.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*KVJtGO9a6ic9xwy_b7oVgA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*cgWdAx-T48vE_nm303UBXQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*oBkaEI0x4oZhYLWLwJ7ujA.jpeg)

In earlier online articles, Cat Alley was introduced by Japanese bloggers, but during my visit this year, it felt quite different; Cat Alley is a small path leading down from Senkoji Temple, and I didn't see a single stray cat. Most of the cat cafes along the way were closed, giving a somewhat lonely feeling as I walked down. Eventually, I found a cafe that was still open, called "[ブーケ ダルブル](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EEgG9QQ4JEhrgTv78){:target="_blank"}," where I could enjoy a cup of coffee and take a break.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*_II1PZ_V5MIhU6gjjOKkpQ.png)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*X-p1A9aK9axJI5b3fulAWw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*ANvCs92M_L6FjVOIACWxmg.png)

The cafe has a nice location, but the path leading up to it also exudes a lonely vibe with overgrown weeds. The seating inside is limited, and there aren't many food options; however, the owner is very friendly, and the shop cat is quite affectionate, often coming to sit beside you.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*kOOBxwOOYrTrX6qg343Xpw.jpeg)

On the way back to the main street, I encountered a very quiet local shrine.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*smXR5LkLBLLdH_yaJIVH1Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*hMEICjDgcA6MAC-XCe51Yw.jpeg)

On the way back to Onomichi Station, I decided to take the inner shopping street, and for lunch, I had the famous Onomichi ramen — “[Onomichi Ramen Shoya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CCD8F1HshTU59syb7){:target="_blank"}”.

Onomichi ramen (founded by Taiwanese) is quite special, floating with a generous amount of white pork back fat and bamboo shoots.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*CTQVxiffaVYq9PhiVn2OXQ.jpeg)

After leisurely strolling back to Onomichi Station, since it was still early, I decided to head to the nearby Fukuyama City.

> _I didn't calculate the time well, and ended up waiting an extra 30 minutes for the train. Friends coming to Onomichi, remember to manage your time well._

#### Fukuyama

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*cKXBZqaGiLnC_Varn4PcBQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*L5wZN7xGhmNyZ-Ml3ph_YQ.jpeg)

From Fukuyama Station, you can see Fukuyama Castle. I didn't go in, just took a photo from a distance and left.

#### **Tonomachi**

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*ZafEophTKy92TAq14VGdYg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*iqqeITVAoMWdePr97Q6Gvw.jpeg)

Back at Fukuyama Station, you can see the bus boarding instructions to "Tonomachi." Initially, I thought Tonomachi would be hard to reach because it's a seaside town, but I must admire Japan's tourism and transportation signs; they are very clear.

> p.s. I didn't do any special research on Tonomachi before the trip; it was a spontaneous decision to go for a walk.

> My understanding of Tonomachi is limited to being the filming location for "Ponyo on the Cliff," Japan's first modern port city, and a place where Sakamoto Ryoma once negotiated. A must-visit for history buffs.

Once on the bus, the final stop is Tonomachi \(travel time: about 40 minutes\).

#### Senjyo Island

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*nGQpOr-F_uRH2ce3oRMTMw.jpeg)

I directly referred to the local tourist map and thought I would first go to Senjyo Island to see the scenery.

After getting off the bus, I walked back to the "Fukuyama City Ferry Terminal" to take the ferry to Senjyo Island \(about 10 minutes\).

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*vDKtI-s8ndvwrt330G7M_w.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*yeA4jAzn2grg_ZMqfH997g.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*937pWhC7CiWNGyG3S4oZyQ.jpeg)

The boat has an antique feel, giving a sudden sense of becoming a pirate king. Although the journey is short, it offers a bird's-eye view of the Seto Inland Sea and Senjyo Island, with a pleasant breeze.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*TUoVIqRtUWpR89LroEqCQA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*pZ9_AcETxbb9gxMRK04npw.jpeg)

After arriving on the island, I didn't see any pedestrians; the island was desolate. The original Tonomachi beach visitor center was already closed and prepared for demolition, and the trails to other beaches in the mountains were also closed due to falling rocks; only one ryokan at the entrance was still in operation.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*lKqGg_lIDujVWlAs5pkCQA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*QvWNm0FJMxGehq_FXAClLw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*GxAW50j3unwnRdlMxyakfA.jpeg)

Tonomachi beach now only has a vast tranquil beach, with only the occasional sounds of a group of sea ducks playing. \(It was also my first time seeing saltwater ducks, not saltwater chicken\)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*aGuuliBewJVz_DW_lrDD1Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Kx0wR7fhEHmSQoRyWuTlfg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*BVcPUWx0WxZy5bZa4MSsZQ.jpeg)

Approximately stayed for 15 minutes, with nowhere to go, so I waited for the ferry to return; although this place is desolate, there are still vending machines! On the way back, I took a closer look at the distant Benten Island, a lonely little island standing in the middle of the sea with a torii gate.

#### Tomonoura

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*ydwDxOhTwmaiSrD98FuVpg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*t__uaqL-NHuky3Ri3cR0qw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*L-jm3vDxb2-ZqtAmtvCHbA.jpeg)

By the time I returned to Tomonoura, it was close to evening. I strolled to the port to see the lanterns and the scenery of the Japanese town. Along the way, many people and photography enthusiasts were already sitting on the steps by the port, setting up their cameras, waiting for the sunset.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*SeorqAWQs7qe8YLMkXwdPA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*E3kD_XkOhHlG5FJSMQr7UQ.jpeg)

Tomonoura is famous for its nourishing and life-saving sake, and there was a strong medicinal wine smell in the air. Since I needed to hurry back to Hiroshima, I took the bus back to Fukuyama before it got dark.

After returning to Fukuyama, I jumped directly onto the train to Hiroshima, bidding farewell to this tranquil and peaceful city. For dinner, I bought a takeout grilled meat bento box from "[Sumiyaki Yakiniku Minami Saruhashi Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C1hjH3o1KZe9bFFx7){:target="_blank"}" on the way back to the hotel.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*4rgR6XxTqCj3Ttl36q1FnQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*eaZ-_Cby5JKRX4nzyJJNkA.jpeg)

Additionally, I added two fried oysters from the convenience store (only 100 yen each).

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*E0hLC9VLo4tah6MgxOEqog.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*hZQQHGWrXR_hDRmEZ3EZhw.jpeg)

For a late-night snack, I still opted for Y1000+ convenience store hot food.

### Day 4 Kure City, Final Tour of Hiroshima City (Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, Hiroshima Castle, Shukkeien)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*WmcYfx8BQwNrVp_0SQJsEA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*vNoFiM5ZkznaCYLgdjHp7g.jpeg)

Early in the morning, I checked out of Toyoko Inn and dragged my luggage to the Hiroshima APA Hotel where I would stay that night.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*PthDRuEg7AES_KIzrFa-3A.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*GuEtFX9d9PA5Im7PLxkAcQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*ef6aepg-6ERDvr5jJlxZ9A.jpeg)

After storing my luggage, I walked back to Hiroshima Station to take the train to Kure City (about 50 minutes). As I approached Kure City, looking out the right window gave me a feeling of returning to the Fulong and Yilan train routes, with mountains on the left and the sea on the right, the scenery was pleasant.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*gYNCT8nC5xaQ5cd6DpzSGA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*_lyLdp5j60H-lRDZTBMURA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*YffE_SVn5hs9c3AwrLBkwA.jpeg)

After exiting the station, you can go to the tourist information center to get a travel guide for Kure City. (I think the design is great!)

Following the signs, you can walk from the station's sky bridge all the way to the Yamato Museum and the Kure Maritime Museum.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*WWo4EbbEMpeXQBf8eY9dow.jpeg)

When you reach the end, don’t rush to go down the sky bridge; you can capture great views of the Kure Maritime Museum — submarines from the sky bridge.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*c1BkFzWE_wr4tscbWg8hzQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*kPeWz4lsPF1vs4NzVNBneQ.jpeg)

> For friends planning to visit Kure City and Hiroshima in the future, you can also take a boat to Miyajima and back to Hiroshima. I originally wanted to take the boat back to Hiroshima, but I missed the timing, so I gave up this time.

#### Yamato Museum

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*E3npgh-TZU54G4E5JtN1jg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*3TVr3YFnVBEnzbWIlTZ9Ng.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*mUYyUBQvTTx8mbQ2516W2w.jpeg)

Inside, there is a Yamato battleship that can be viewed up close in 360 degrees, with details almost fully realized, as well as the history of battleships and wars, fighter planes, cannons, and more. It's a must-see for battleship and military enthusiasts. Additionally, there happens to be a special exhibition showcasing the design and development history of Japanese aircraft carriers, including design sketches.

#### Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force Kure Museum

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*_G0SMX-74rgnIJtqQJWwvw.jpeg)

After leaving the Yamato Museum, walking further back leads to the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force Kure Museum, which is free to enter.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*9BWAVAGIVbZ4va3NDMjo1A.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Wi-vcHvcF-4RqQosTduksQ.jpeg)

The museum mainly displays the living and working environments inside submarines, engines, mines, and historical artifacts.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*44uKtTLacF4aXq6MPuFjhQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*u7Yog59KOjSAg0R2iWKHMg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*qaRVV4LFdCmfMoNjsLFNjg.jpeg)

The most special part is that you can actually enter a submarine to visit the real compartments, dormitories, captain's room, control room, and use the periscope to see the external environment.

#### Kure City Shopping Street

After visiting the museum, it was close to noon, and I was looking for food. I initially wanted to eat navy curry, but after checking the reviews, it didn't seem particularly special, so I decided to walk back to Kure City Shopping Street to make a decision. (Actually, it was quite far, and in the opposite direction; it took about 30 minutes to walk.)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*08ryfbJs_lMZqiAkj7r_0Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*TuYPPoADttJ1zWk716UK8A.jpeg)

In the end, I chose to eat Kure cold noodles, which are similar to cold noodles with tonkotsu chashu. The noodles are chilled, refreshing in taste, and the portion is quite large, so a small size is sufficient.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*tvKWEChMpB9c1qyPqqsb0g.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*-mgVYo5H_JjdmXhMbplH2Q.jpeg)

After eating, I prepared to head back to the station. On the way, I also bought "Fukuzumi Fried Red Bean Cake," which was a bit sweet and oily, tasting quite ordinary. Additionally, I picked up navy coffee and curry as souvenirs ([subarucoffee_store/](https://www.instagram.com/subarucoffee_store/){:target="_blank"}; the staff were very friendly and enthusiastic).

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*_4hhVGYUBZvVOOhvQNVgpA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*nDnjMo8kQAXiCy8iF6Fb1Q.jpeg)

I walked back to Kure Station and took the train back to Hiroshima.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*wUx4gtoAl8c7kBvhIXhe-w.jpeg)

After returning to Hiroshima, I took a final tour of the Hiroshima city area. Upon exiting Hiroshima Station, there are three routes of sightseeing buses available for selection (included in the JR Pass), allowing you to choose based on your desired direction.

I wanted to visit Shukkeien (Hiroshima Museum of Art) first, so I chose to take the red maple leaf bus.

#### Shukkeien

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*RIFGTX6ipG1G0uSlNsShcg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*cPpsmj5ff-TNM4yEWxExvA.jpeg)

Shukkeien is located right behind the Hiroshima Museum of Art, and when purchasing tickets, you can also buy a combined ticket for Shukkeien + Hiroshima Museum of Art.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*hEU5JheqeYqj8G06-RZyYQ.jpeg)

Shukkei-en is a quaint little garden featuring many miniature landscapes, such as maple leaves, small bridges over flowing water, bamboo groves, pines and cypress trees, and hills... It's quite nice to take a stroll and enjoy the scenery.

#### Hiroshima Castle

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*yxTWLBwpKuf025kiuWemxw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*uWLykJP2_3VnKtZWZATAzQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*biTmLBV6gM3lZjproKG_eg.jpeg)

The next stop is a walk to Hiroshima Castle. The original Hiroshima Castle was destroyed in the atomic bombing, and the current structure is a reconstruction. It looks quite new overall, and the height is not very tall, so there isn't much of a view from the tenshu (main keep).

#### Peace Memorial Museum, Peace Memorial Park

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*sHMbGZ-XOt7yBqxjpN2wcQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*goGSippywpI5vVhdK1WHOg.jpeg)

The final stop is back at the Peace Memorial Park, right next to the [Children's Peace Monument (not very tall, did not go inside)](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/171128?cid=19365&ud1=31b9b3a63abc){:target="_blank"}.

I happened to encounter Shingo Katori in the afternoon paying his respects.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*-HqxYUWhkWiNWXnA20TtZg.jpeg)

I queued to buy tickets to visit the Peace Memorial Museum, which contains a wealth of information about the atomic bombing, history, as well as documents, photographs, and artifacts; the overall experience was very heavy and shocking.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*kRBjSbNgdK5pEgtpkQi2BQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*2FHg46ebTbABH0Yn8Ju4pg.jpeg)

On the other side of the park, there is a memorial hall, but it felt too heavy, so I didn't go in.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*pl1v9-9TO7TXgaPC1wM0ew.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Xq6dIYI1LNr6CQ0oLjvGkQ.jpeg)

In the evening, a light drizzle began to fall, and combined with the feelings after just witnessing the painful lessons of history, I returned to Hiroshima Station.

I casually bought some souvenirs and takeout bento at the station before heading back to the hotel to rest. I still need to do laundry today.

APA hotels are really everywhere, with President curry, President water, and President's books...

The room density is as usual, with over 60 rooms on a single floor.

The room is still small, but well-equipped, and the electronic facilities are very convenient (you can see the laundry room status from the room, and the TV can directly Airplay).

I ran into a big hassle while doing laundry, with a long queue. There are only 7 washing machines for over 1000 rooms in the entire building. In the end, I timed it right, went downstairs to queue when the washing machine was almost done, and finally finished washing and drying my clothes around 11 PM (they weren't dry yet, so I continued to air them out in my room).

Staying up so late, having a late-night snack is quite reasonable! Still Y1000 + milk + convenience store cooked food.

### Day 5 Kurashiki, Okayama

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*hA2HBH2yrYFtbK7CjJ7AxQ.jpeg)

The morning is beautiful, with clear weather; I checked out of the hotel and said goodbye to Hiroshima, heading to the hotel in Kurashiki to drop off my luggage (I could also leave it in Okayama since I need to go to Okayama first before heading to Kurashiki).

#### Kurashiki Bikan Historical Quarter, Achi Shrine

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*qejzHASiMgjfpezApmZIeQ.jpeg)

The first stop is Achi Shrine, which is situated at a higher elevation, allowing for a panoramic view of the entire Kurashiki area. It's quite serene with not many people around.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*wpCQJG_JwCw-nJEVCpX64A.jpeg)

Achi Shrine is not large but is famous for its ema (votive tablets) pavilion. If you draw a bad fortune, you can tie it under the corresponding animal head according to your zodiac sign. There is also the [Hanachandori](https://supertaste.tvbs.com.tw/asia/340177){:target="_blank"} for wishing for good relationships:

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Wwqyd2o3VSN-mnEP6rtstg.jpeg)

The scenic area is not large, but it is very tranquil and pleasant to stroll around. Unfortunately, the boat tickets were sold out that day, so I missed the chance to experience it, but walking around the nearby alleys was quite enjoyable.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*hR5CK8dXU_EQCZto6wMjRA.jpeg)

For lunch, I had the famous [Miyake Shoten](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qdRm9RU7wzMbC8VVA){:target="_blank"} curry set. The rich curry paired with burdock strips was delicious.

After eating, I continued to explore. When I got tired, I went to eat at [Parlor Fruit Komachi](http://www.kurashiki-yoimachi.co.jp/yoimachi/parlor.html){:target="_blank"} (the specialty is that the staff wear Taisho-era maid outfits) and had a fruit sundae with Okayama's "Seirou" grapes and fruit ice cream; the grapes were incredibly sweet.

For souvenirs, you can buy [GOHOBI](https://setouchifinder.com/tw/detail/10118){:target="_blank"} collagen Okayama fruit jelly.

#### Okayama Korakuen Illumination, Okayama Castle

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*YpHCUtOyGE31IdDk5tESjg.jpeg)

Accompanied by the sunset, I took the train back to Okayama Station. Upon exiting, I directly took the streetcar to the area around Okayama Castle.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*3W_9TpZVHOkjYBoMTUK8kg.jpeg)

The first stop was Okayama Korakuen, where the illumination at night felt very romantic and beautiful.

> [**Okayama Korakuen + Okayama Castle has an illumination event every year in mid to late November.**](https://www.okayama-japan.jp/tw/event/19541){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*qpVyBqyJ22Yc8xz90jTYbw.jpeg)

On the way, I visited the neighboring Okayama Castle to enjoy the night view, which had a unique charm under the illumination combined with the maple leaves.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*wgkvVMoF6RNu8L7HMYPfAA.jpeg)

Dinner was conveniently resolved with a bowl of Ippudo ramen, and then I strolled back to Okayama Station (the way was also illuminated, very beautiful). Before heading back to Kurashiki, I had some time to browse the discount store (Don Quijote), but there weren't many souvenirs; I still needed to go to Okayama Station or the department store to find souvenirs...

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*spjr7DRx25wkmWsIE5uweQ.jpeg)

By the time I returned to Kurashiki, it was already evening, the weather was cold, and the people on the street were hurrying home. The Outlet behind Kurashiki Station had already closed.

I just realized that this hotel does not have a 24-hour front desk, but fortunately, I didn't return too late! The hotel room is well-equipped, with a microwave, kettle, and glasses cleaning machine.

On my last night in Japan, I simply had convenience store chicken nuggets for Y1000 and bought an extra bottle of white peach strawberry milk as a late-night snack before falling into a deep sleep.

### Day 6 Okayama, Return Trip

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*1kyJvOpLI3ihAU6mMtHzQQ.jpeg)

Early in the morning, just as the sun was rising, I checked out and headed to Okayama.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Hm1kET2fwTNqTmDCLySGTg.png)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*0cTmOAzxc5q4mlqsWjBogA.jpeg)

> It is planned to take the airport shuttle from Okayama back to the airport. **There is also a direct shuttle from Kurashiki to Okayama Airport, but the frequency is lower ( [For details, please refer to the official website](https://www.okayama-airport.org/tw/access/bus){:target="_blank"} )**. Since I didn't finish exploring Okayama yesterday, I decided to head straight to Okayama and then return from there.

#### Kibitsu Shrine

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*kxqSXDcfqv7tu5hxVFCRVg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*0xcVFXMOHrhMQcIbGUB93w.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*U77ZXlz-x3-e-HtTLAWCeg.jpeg)

After getting off the train, I headed straight to Kibitsu Shrine (about a 30-minute ride). After getting off the train, it takes about another 15 minutes to walk there. There is a historic cypress wood corridor, along with ginkgo trees and historical buildings, making it a nice place to stroll and pay respects.

On the way, there is also Kibitsuhiko Shrine on the other side of the mountain, which can be visited as well, but due to time constraints, I skipped it this time.

#### Okayama AEON

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*3IYXW1HHV8srIHTuJBdMRw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*bykuAeRM2sLnRScqhlwBWQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*ckSyNw4EkKDtUODyWDHR2Q.jpeg)

After returning to Okayama Station, I went to the nearby AEON department store to buy some souvenirs, do some shopping, and have a lunch of tempura soba before preparing to queue for the airport shuttle back to Okayama Airport.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*fJNiCtsSsRnjPOvSzN2Oig.jpeg)

> **There are many people queuing for the shuttle, but there's no need to worry about not getting on, as there will be additional trips to ensure everyone can reach the airport.**
```

#### Okayama Momotaro Airport (OKJ)

The airport is a bit dated and is about the same size as Kumamoto Airport. I completed security checks, check-in, and immigration by around 13:50, leaving almost two hours until the departure time of 15:25.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*DBRSEVhlkEWmssAlqhcySw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*3YCu2TUlMXp6W95RtQsGnQ.jpeg)

The airport has very few flights, so it only took about 15 minutes to check in and drop off luggage. Interestingly, the X-ray machine is located in the airport lobby, and after passing through the X-ray, you get a seal before going to check in (if you open your luggage, you will be asked to go through security again).

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*aIb2fL4eCvk4FsNldk2tSg.jpeg)

After checking in my luggage, I wandered around the terminal (there are only two floors). There is an observation deck, a café, and a few restaurants to eat at. When I got tired, I bought a white peach ice cream to enjoy.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*AV0wiyIjyHbm4LJ4DO8QOQ.jpeg)

Security checks were also quick, but at Okayama Airport, you have to take off your boots for security, which is a bit inconvenient.

I encountered a flight delay and waited in the lounge. Finally, we took off at 16:24 (almost an hour late).

#### Interlude

After the last trip " [10-Day Solo Trip in Kyushu 2023](../d78e0b15a08a/) ", I felt an indescribable sense of loneliness in the following days. Firstly, I was in an unfamiliar place alone, and secondly, I couldn't speak Japanese, so I hardly talked for 10 days. That feeling of loneliness is still fresh in my memory, so I wasn't very eager to go again. It was only because I had to work and happened to find a super discounted flight that I set off.

On the first day, while exchanging for the JR Pass, I happened to get stuck and met a group of Taiwanese people who were also stuck. We took turns trying until we succeeded. Coincidentally, she was also going to Hiroshima, and she reminded me when she got stuck at the entrance. We both bought tickets for the same train, and she got a reserved seat. We both wanted to stop by a convenience store first, and since we were in the same industry, we had a lot to talk about. We were both traveling alone, so we ended up forming a group and completing the same itinerary on the first day.

> **Many of the itineraries, attractions, and time arrangements were provided by Angie. If I had been traveling alone, I might have wandered aimlessly or missed out, and then I would have ended up walking alone for 6 days.**
