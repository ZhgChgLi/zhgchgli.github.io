### [Travel Diary] 2023: 6-Day Free Trip to Hiroshima and Okayama

A 6-day trip to Hiroshima, Okayama, Fukuyama, Kurashiki, and Onomichi in 2023.

### Introduction

After resigning at the end of August, I set off in September for a "10-Day Solo Trip to Kyushu" after nearly three months of rest. I initially planned to return to work in mid-November, and upon starting my new job, I would need to embark on new projects. Since the new company has limited vacation days, I would have to start accumulating annual leave from scratch according to the basic labor laws. Therefore, I considered going on another trip (planning started at the end of October).
#### Update 2024/11/03:
- [Travel Diary: 2024 7-Day Solo Trip to the San'in Region (+Kansai) - Shimane, Tottori, Himeji, Osaka](../aacd5f5cacd1/)

In 2024, I visited the San'in region, and friends with time to spare might consider combining both the San'yō and San'in regions for a trip!

#### Destination — Hiroshima (Okayama)

On my last trip, I had an unexpected little adventure on the way to [Nagasaki](../d78e0b15a08a/) — I received a souvenir from Mihara City in **Hiroshima Prefecture**. After visiting the Atomic Bomb Museum and Peace Memorial Park in Nagasaki, I thought it would be nice to check out **Hiroshima** as well.

Many friends also recommended **Hiroshima**, known for its World Heritage Site — Itsukushima Shrine, oysters, the Seto Inland Sea, Onomichi, and Rabbit Island...

Since I was traveling solo and wanted to avoid big cities and places I had already visited, while also hoping for convenient transportation, **Hiroshima** seemed like a great choice!

#### Dates — 11/13–18

I originally planned to start work on 11/20 (which later got pushed to 12/1). After deducting the last day for a buffer, I booked my return for 11/18 (Saturday).

For the outbound flight, I initially had plans with a friend on 11/12, so I aimed to depart on 11/13 (Monday). However, since I hadn't started work yet, my schedule was flexible, and I decided based on when I could find cheaper flights.

#### A Series of Twists and Turns

**❌ The most intuitive way to get to Hiroshima is through Hiroshima Airport, but the conditions were very unfavorable:**
- Timing: Late arrival (17:20) and early return (09:30); plus, there were no flights on Saturday, so I had to return on Friday (11/17).
- Location: Required a shuttle bus (about 55 minutes), and after landing, I could only catch the last bus at 21:40 or 22:20, arriving at the station around 22:00 or 23:00, which was quite late.
- Price: ~=$17,000, too expensive.

**❌ Fukuoka in and out + Shinkansen was still inconvenient:**
- Timing: Departing at 16:30 and returning at 10:55, also late arrival and early return, but slightly better.
- Location: Convenient transportation, but it would take about 1.5 hours by Shinkansen to get to Hiroshima.
- Price: ~=$12,000; if I wanted to return later (20:35), it would be ~=$17,000 or I could take an early flight at 06:50.

**❌ Later, I found out that I could fly with Tigerair to Okayama:**
- Timing: Departing at 11:10 and returning at 15:25, which was great.
- Location: Okayama Airport also required a shuttle bus, but the arrival time was early, giving me plenty of time.
- Price: Including a 20 KG checked bag, the round trip was about ~= $14,000.

Since I had just spent money on the "10 Days in Kyushu" trip in September, I was hesitant to go unless I could keep the flight price around $10,000, so I was almost ready to give up on this trip.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Agd-DC4jUc5xcvez71cIVw.png)

On 10/31, while scrolling through Facebook, I happened to see a post in the "Japan Free Travel Discussion Group" about a promotional flight discount from an airline. I saw that [Tigerair](https://static.tigerairtw.com/www/events/OKJ23winter/index.html){:target="_blank"} was offering discounts for tickets purchased between 11/3 10:00 and 11/6 23:59. Luckily, I approached it with a laid-back attitude, thinking if I could snag a deal, I would go; if not, it was fine.

On the morning of 11/3, I was fortunate enough to find the best tickets for my desired dates (11/13–18), with the best flight times and prices, so there was no reason not to go!

- Departing at 11:10 and returning at 15:25, including a round trip with 20KG checked baggage, seat selection, and miscellaneous fees: **$7,012**

### Preparations

After securing my flight, there was only a week left until departure, so I jumped right into preparations.

I planned to visit Miyajima, Onomichi, the Kurashiki Bikan Historical Area, and Okayama Castle; therefore, I decided to base myself in Hiroshima for a longer stay and then move to Okayama closer to my return date.
#### Transportation

I purchased the [JR Pass for Okayama, Hiroshima, and Yamaguchi Area](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20311-jr-okayama-hiroshima-yamaguchi-area-pass?cid=19365&ud1=31b9b3a63abc){:target="_blank"} (¥ 17,000, just in time before the price increase at the end of October 2023).

The one-way fare from Okayama to Hiroshima is ¥6,460, and the round trip is ¥12,920; considering trips to Miyajima, Onomichi, and Kure... it should be worth it; buying the JR Pass is the most convenient option.
#### Accommodation (5 Nights)

[**Toyoko Inn Hiroshima Station Baseball Park Front**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sm8WnCdTk2qf2VgCA){:target="_blank"} **(3 Nights)**

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*-YwLmHr8op_lrrQY3SCd2g.png)

- Price: $4,612, $1,537/night, single non-smoking room
- Transportation: It looks close on the map (actually about a 15-minute walk due to construction and crossing a level crossing), and it’s not a lively area, located outside the Mazda Zoom-Zoom Stadium, which is quiet since there are no games.

Toyoko Inn consistently offers great value for money, making it the best accommodation in terms of price and environment this time.

[**APA Hotel Hiroshima Station Front Ohashi**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dSk4agNLsMDA638Z9){:target="_blank"} **(1 Night)**

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*wt4pri9pUzkFiUZzZIgWOQ.png)

- Price: $2,501, 1 night, single non-smoking room
- Location: Closer to Hiroshima Station, but it’s still a bit of a walk, requiring crossing a major road and a bridge (about 10 minutes); it takes about 15 minutes to walk from the previous accommodation, so it’s somewhat convenient.

Since I couldn’t book four nights at Toyoko Inn, I had to stay one night at the APA Hotel.

[**Livemax Okayama Kurashiki Station Front Hotel**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pcPAvCaaH4mzo36o6){:target="_blank"} **(1 Night)**

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*F5rO356jsxQwugfbxANN8w.png)

- Price: $3,263, 1 night, single non-smoking room
- Location: Just outside Kurashiki Station, about a five-minute walk, very convenient.

I found Kurashiki because I couldn’t find an acceptable-priced hotel in Okayama, so I had to look for something along the JR line since Kurashiki also has a shuttle back to Okayama Airport; I decided to find a hotel near Kurashiki.

This was the only hotel in Kurashiki that still had rooms available, was conveniently located, and had a reasonable price.

#### Itinerary

Originally, my plan was as follows:
- 11/13: Shopping and trying Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki
- 11/14: Miyajima and Hiroshima City: Itsukushima Shrine, Momijidani Park, Miyajima Ropeway -> Shishiiwa Observatory, Atomic Bomb Dome, Peace Memorial Park, Atomic Bomb Museum, and the Paper Crane Tower (Hiroshima Tower)
- 11/15: Onomichi and Senkoji Temple
- 11/16: Kure City and Hiroshima City (same as 11/14), Hiroshima Castle
- 11/17: Okayama and Kurashiki: Okayama Korakuen, Okayama Castle, Kibitsu Shrine, Kurashiki Bikan Historical Area, Kurashiki Outlet, and Achi Shrine
- 11/18: Kurashiki Outlet and return trip

Rabbit Island is too far and inconvenient, so it’s only on my reference list.

#### Let’s Go!

### Day 1: Departure

I took off at 11:10 AM, so I took my time getting ready in the morning.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*yeEzGfYKPOkgTloqwikhmg.jpeg)

I took the airport MRT from Taipei Main Station to Taoyuan Airport Terminal 1, arriving at the check-in counter around 08:50.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*JC4MGzSm0SyDbYDdU8SfvA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*224m8Mrtd6cq_NtNa1nE0w.jpeg)

There weren’t many people, so I quickly completed check-in and immigration. [Terminal 1](https://web.taoyuan-airport.com/services_facilities?p=1&m=9CBEA40D-B7AB-EB11-AB4D-D45D6481BBEB&t=1&a=2){:target="_blank"} doesn’t have much to eat, so I just bought some fried chicken and coffee before heading to the boarding area.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*l--F5TKOIv1R1VLw2xhL9Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Wm_YG0rPckM1iq_uUQ2Lgg.jpeg)

While waiting to board, I wasn’t very hungry, so I didn’t eat the food I bought.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*tE1ZkTG7TalQrmr3bsegUw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*lgXM2X4L-OXwTiEMpAi8Ug.jpeg)

We took off at 11:07 and arrived at OKJ (Okayama Momotaro Airport) at 14:11. During the flight, I realized that Tigerair doesn’t allow passengers to bring their own food on board (Peach Airlines doesn’t have a specific rule against it), so I had to hold off on eating until after landing.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*-SpeO3_twTbSibfVz4TufQ.jpeg)

Okayama Airport is super small; I just followed the crowd and went straight through customs without any corners to sneak a snack. Since I had fried chicken, which might have health regulations, I handed the whole package over to customs for disposal.

I completed immigration and baggage claim by around 14:40 (super fast). Later, I checked the flight schedule, and there are very few flights at Okayama Airport; there might only be one international flight a day, so there were hardly any people, just those on my flight. Customs and health inspections were quick, too!

Once outside, I hopped on the airport shuttle. Because of the limited flight schedule, I had to wait until **16:10** for the scheduled shuttle to Okayama Station; however, there was an additional shuttle that left as soon as it filled up (it would wait for the next bus if full), which was very considerate and saved everyone time!

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*JAe4i7XdyYcjdsQkjRDzwQ.png)

After getting off, I found the escalator leading up to Okayama Station and went to exchange my JR Pass. I located the machine marked with green and labeled “**EXPRESS予約、5489 お受取**” to redeem my JR Pass ticket.

I had previously found an [exchange tutorial online](https://icepanda74.com/jr-west-pass/){:target="_blank"} that said to select the blue button for "予約したきっぷのお受取り," but when I tried following the steps, I kept getting a "QR Code Invalid" error when scanning the QR code. Even entering the order number didn’t work.

Finally, after several attempts with a group of Taiwanese travelers, we discovered that we needed to use the yellow button on the bottom left labeled "**QRコードの読取り**" to redeem it. After clicking that, I could scan the QR code directly, and it worked! (I suspect the JR machines have been updated.)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*q7bTApvhtGL0JL1NIDoFDA.png)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*iWb8VSdUEYDonDQ6GDfmXQ.png)

The machine dispensed two instruction sheets and **one JR Pass (the ticket marked ✔ in the image)**. After receiving the JR Pass, I could also use it to [complete my seat reservations](../d78e0b15a08a/). **The JR Pass ticket is used for entering and exiting the stations, while the reservation ticket is just for reference regarding seat and time; it cannot be used for entry and exit.**

I was really hungry since I hadn’t eaten anything, so I went to a convenience store to grab something to eat before taking the next JR train.

I arrived at Hiroshima Station around 16:45.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*oL8_C5_VSGO6QKeHnCbGOQ.jpeg)

I checked into my hotel to drop off my luggage before heading out to find something to eat. The street was quite deserted without any baseball games, and across the street was the railway, with not many shops around, but luckily there was a large Lawson convenience store nearby.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*2SoIwTR9QF8c2jKioGaPYg.jpeg)

![[Hiroshima Okonomiyaki, Station Front Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C8aLTG48rhfKwVQz6){:target="_blank"}](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*mIjh2c9lqbNQm1dug1HcrA.png)

[Hiroshima Okonomiyaki, Station Front Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C8aLTG48rhfKwVQz6){:target="_blank"}

After returning to the station, I went to eat Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki at "[Hiroshima Okonomiyaki, Station Front Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C8aLTG48rhfKwVQz6){:target="_blank"}," located on the 6th floor (next to Ekie department store) on the right side as you exit Hiroshima Station. As soon as I got off the elevator, I was struck by how unique it was; the entire floor is filled with okonomiyaki restaurants, allowing you to choose your favorite place to sit.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*31Pe4NiL7DBIaWdh-wbF-g.jpeg)

I ordered an okonomiyaki with added mochi (which includes fried noodles) and found the taste to be average. It was filling, with both noodles and mochi inside.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*3H1rWAQ3rCQMNqY8wPXO6w.jpeg)

On the way back to the hotel, I picked up a late-night snack. It was quite cold in Hiroshima at night, around 4 degrees Celsius.

Unpacking the room.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*XQ38j0JGEvq6EbBB1VRA9g.jpeg)

When I opened the curtains, I could see the railway outside (there are about 10 lines, so you need to be quick when crossing the tracks). The downside of the room is that you can hear the clattering sound of trains passing by.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*kZ-W5Rp-BGzJfHs_FoE9JQ.jpeg)

For this trip, I brought the [Allite A1 65W GaN Fast Charger + Allite Liquid Silicone Fast Charging Cable](https://reurl.cc/67LEer){:target="_blank"} combination. Since switching to the iPhone 15, almost all my devices now use a Type-C port. When traveling, I only need to bring a Type-C charging cable to cover everything.

The [Allite A1 65W GaN Fast Charger](https://reurl.cc/67LEer){:target="_blank"} supports single-port 65W and dual-port 45W + 18W fast charging. It's compact and easy to carry, so when I see a charging outlet while out, I can plug in to recharge. Back at the hotel, I can charge my power bank with one port and my phone, watch, iPad, or Switch with the other—convenient and fast.

The [Allite Liquid Silicone Fast Charging Cable](https://reurl.cc/67LEer){:target="_blank"} (1.5m) is long enough to use while my power bank is in my bag. The liquid silicone material is different from regular plastic; it's skin-friendly, easy to bend for storage, and won't get all crumpled up.

This was the best charging companion for my trip.

### Day 2: Miyajima (Itsukushima Shrine), Momijidani Park, Shishiiwa Observatory, Atomic Bomb Dome, Peace Memorial Park

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*09NEVdiOQ3PePi_cmthisA.jpeg)

In the morning, I took the JR train to Miyajimaguchi Station. After exiting, I walked towards the pier to find the ferry station. The JR Pass includes the ferry ticket to Miyajima, so there's no need to buy a separate ticket, but you do need to pay an additional [Miyajima Visitor Tax (¥100)](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E7%99%BB%E5%AE%AE%E5%B3%B6%E8%A8%AA%E5%9A%B4%E5%B3%B6%E7%A5%9E%E7%A4%BE-2023%E5%B9%B410%E6%9C%881%E6%97%A5%E8%B5%B7%E9%96%8B%E5%BE%B5%E8%A8%AA%E5%95%8F%E7%A8%85-045414147.html){:target="_blank"}, and there will be staff to guide you in purchasing the visitor tax ticket.

> You can also take the Hiroshima Electric Railway to Miyajimaguchi, but I remember it takes longer.

The ferry takes about 10 minutes to reach Miyajima. It's very stable and doesn't have a diesel smell, and as we approach, you can see the iconic floating torii gate from afar!

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*0-nFldh1yauKTKAhd2FVGw.jpeg)

Once on the island, I headed straight towards the floating torii gate. Taking photos along the shore was beautiful and less crowded.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*-t-wQz9vGbpn7hk2T73g8g.jpeg)

There are also many wild deer on the island that can be quite mischievous XD.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*4UzgS1ocwWemFhgzR4QMVA.jpeg)

After passing by Itsukushima Shrine, I headed to the Miyajima Ropeway to go up to Shishiiwa Observatory.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*6T301OV5u4hrZ_2G2MmAYw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Tm7mBakYqAH4ajoIhGrhWg.jpeg)

You need to take two segments of the ropeway to reach Shishiiwa Observatory. The advantage of taking the ropeway first is that there are almost no crowds (there were many people at the Itsukushima Shrine below). The first segment is a small gondola that holds a maximum of 6 people (it runs frequently and covers a longer distance), while the second segment is a larger gondola (if I remember correctly, it runs every 15 minutes and can accommodate more people, about 20, but the distance is shorter).

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*h_IfZzojUcGIsJ2eYWfyHQ.jpeg)

At the top, you can overlook the entire Seto Inland Sea, feel the breeze, and enjoy the view of the small islands—very relaxing.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*6yCjyDKNlfbicD60-2cD4w.jpeg)

Itsukushima Shrine is built right by the sea, with very clean water, creating a serene atmosphere. You can also queue to take photos of the floating torii gate from the front.

During this season, the low tide occurs at around 3 AM or 5 PM, so I missed the chance to see the shrine and torii gate during low tide.

For lunch, I had to try the oysters. The oyster rice and fried oysters at [Oyster House](https://tabelog.com/tw/hiroshima/A3402/A340202/34003363/){:target="_blank"} were both over 300 yen, delicious and affordable—I'm now an oyster enthusiast!

In the afternoon, I returned to Hiroshima city to visit the Atomic Bomb Dome and Peace Memorial Park.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*wOgawnizU-WTwUl9cr959w.jpeg)

In autumn, Hiroshima is adorned with the yellow of ginkgo trees, the red of maple leaves, and some green leaves, complemented by the cool autumn breeze, as I reflect on everything that has happened in Hiroshima.

> _I encountered many Japanese middle school students on outdoor educational trips at the Peace Memorial Park, with teachers explaining the history. It deeply impressed me how much the Japanese people value historical education and heritage._

#### Back to the Hotel

As evening approached, I returned to the hotel to rest because I was underdressed for the cold outside.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*QZZruRDOmdJ37ziaWWYZqA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*p-9ReufIDYbzkqls7rd3GA.jpeg)

For dinner, I picked up a takeout bento from "[Sumibi Yakiniku Toshi Saruhashi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C1hjH3o1KZe9bFFx7){:target="_blank"}" that I passed on the way back to the hotel. What initially caught my eye was the charcoal grills outside the restaurant, which made it feel very warm. After stopping to check the menu, I discovered they offered takeout bento, so I went inside!

Another interesting feature of their bento is that it has a self-heating function. When I get back to the hotel and want to eat, I just pull a string, and it starts heating up, releasing steam. It feels like it's freshly made no matter when I eat it—very thoughtful!

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*0RivogHw5D_eDTxmY4NZQQ.jpeg)

For my late-night snack from the convenience store today, I got a hot dog, fried chicken, Strong Zero, and a bottle of Yakult Y1000, which is said to help with sleep. (But after walking all day, I was already quite tired.)

### Day 3: Onomichi, Senkoji Temple, Fukuyama, Tomonoura

In the morning, I took the Shinkansen to Mihara, then transferred to a train to Onomichi Station.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*I0K5vrSgtXKMRsyIvntREw.jpeg)

I didn't time it well, so I ended up waiting over 30 minutes to transfer from Mihara to Onomichi.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*z1Q4sDwaHmuCZ2-OoNR0uQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*XUwZTLkI5AGZ-cP5CCVKjg.jpeg)

I exited Onomichi Station through the south exit.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*y-OGrapaY37pTBGIRRwCXQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*CZHXhjDKmoJ28qU5PKJssA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*6CvXsywJ3wC3Mt7blFjpSw.jpeg)

The weather was nice and the temperature was pleasant, so after leaving Onomichi Station, I headed straight to Senkoji Temple. Walking on the mountain side felt reminiscent of Jiufen, with many stairs and steep slopes. Looking to the other side, you can see the Seto Inland Sea, which offers a nice view.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*CB8z5W7Il8i-81CEkY1gGA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*1cMVbuqTv1_LkV-wLt4VDQ.jpeg)

Another option is to take the main road directly to the sign for the Senkoji Temple ropeway, where you can enter and take the ropeway up to the temple.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*a3e3DRIScoHJ-e-WiGHUqg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*wWrh70gToooi2TxjDmlhCw.jpeg)

The view from Senkoji Temple is excellent, allowing you to overlook the entire Onomichi city and the distant Onomichi Bridge.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*7ROiC17DN3oKK8zsV_fOHw.jpeg)

I brought home a cute little Jizo statue (you can choose to write a wish and leave it at Senkoji Temple for blessings or take it home as a keepsake):

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*b7GU1RAZnLc4xL8scn6RSQ.png)

After visiting Senkoji Temple, I headed down to the Cat Alley.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*KVJtGO9a6ic9xwy_b7oVgA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*cgWdAx-T48vE_nm303UBXQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*oBkaEI0x4oZhYLWLwJ7ujA.jpeg)

Early online articles often introduced Cat Alley in Japan, but my visit this year felt different; Cat Alley is a small path down from Senkoji Temple, and I didn't see a single wild cat. Most of the cat cafes along the way were closed, which gave me a bit of a lonely feeling. Eventually, I found one cafe still open, "[Bouquet d'Album](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EEgG9QQ4JEhrgTv78){:target="_blank"}," where I stopped for a coffee break.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*_II1PZ_V5MIhU6gjjOKkpQ.png)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*X-p1A9aK9axJI5b3fulAWw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*ANvCs92M_L6FjVOIACWxmg.png)

The cafe has a nice location, but the path leading up to it felt overgrown and lonely. The cafe had limited seating and menu options, but the owner was very friendly, and the resident cat was quite affectionate, sitting beside me.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*kOOBxwOOYrTrX6qg343Xpw.jpeg)

On my way back down to the main street, I stumbled upon a quiet local shrine.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*smXR5LkLBLLdH_yaJIVH1Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*hMEICjDgcA6MAC-XCe51Yw.jpeg)

On my way back to Onomichi Station, I took a detour through the shopping street and had lunch at the famous Onomichi ramen—"[Onomichi Ramen Shoya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CCD8F1HshTU59syb7){:target="_blank"}."

Onomichi ramen (founded by a Taiwanese person) is quite unique, with a generous amount of pork back fat floating on top, along with bamboo shoots.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*CTQVxiffaVYq9PhiVn2OXQ.jpeg)

After a leisurely stroll back to Onomichi Station, I found that it was still quite early, so I spontaneously decided to head to the nearby Fukuyama City.

> _I miscalculated the time and ended up waiting an extra 30 minutes for the train. Friends coming to Onomichi, make sure to manage your time well._

#### Fukuyama

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*cKXBZqaGiLnC_Varn4PcBQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*L5wZN7xGhmNyZ-Ml3ph_YQ.jpeg)

From Fukuyama Station, you can see Fukuyama Castle. I didn’t go inside but just took a photo from a distance before moving on.

#### **Tomo no Ura**

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*ZafEophTKy92TAq14VGdYg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*iqqeITVAoMWdePr97Q6Gvw.jpeg)

Back at Fukuyama Station, I spotted the bus directions to "Tomo no Ura." Initially, I thought it would be hard to reach since it's a seaside town, but I must commend Japan's tourism and transportation signage; it’s very clear.

> P.S. I didn’t do much research on Tomo no Ura beforehand; it was a spontaneous decision to explore.

> My knowledge of Tomo no Ura was limited to it being the filming location for "Ponyo," Japan's first modern port city, and a historical site where Sakamoto Ryoma once negotiated—definitely a must-visit for history buffs.

Once on the bus, I rode straight to the end stop, which is Tomo no Ura (the journey takes about 40 minutes).

#### Sensuijima

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*nGQpOr-F_uRH2ce3oRMTMw.jpeg)

I referred to the local tourist map and decided to first check out Sensuijima for its scenery.

After getting off the bus, I walked back to the "Fukuyama City Ferry Terminal" to take a ferry to Sensuijima (about a 10-minute ride).

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*vDKtI-s8ndvwrt330G7M_w.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*yeA4jAzn2grg_ZMqfH997g.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*937pWhC7CiWNGyG3S4oZyQ.jpeg)

The ferry had a vintage charm, giving me a sudden feeling of being a sailor. Although the journey was short, it offered a great view of the Seto Inland Sea and Sensuijima, and the breeze was refreshing.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*TUoVIqRtUWpR89LroEqCQA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*pZ9_AcETxbb9gxMRK04npw.jpeg)

Once on the island, I didn’t see any other visitors; it was quite desolate. The original Tomo no Ura beach visitor center was closed and set for demolition, and the trails to other beaches in the mountains were also closed due to falling rocks. The only place still open was a ryokan at the entrance.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*lKqGg_lIDujVWlAs5pkCQA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*QvWNm0FJMxGehq_FXAClLw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*GxAW50j3unwnRdlMxyakfA.jpeg)

The Tomo no Ura beach was left with a vast, tranquil stretch of sand, where I could occasionally hear a group of sea ducks playing. (It was my first time seeing saltwater ducks, not saltwater chicken!)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*aGuuliBewJVz_DW_lrDD1Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Kx0wR7fhEHmSQoRyWuTlfg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*BVcPUWx0WxZy5bZa4MSsZQ.jpeg)

I stayed for about 15 minutes, and with nowhere else to go, I waited for the ferry to return. Despite its desolation, there was still a vending machine! On the way back, I got a closer look at Benten Island, a lonely little island standing in the middle of the sea with a torii gate.

#### Tomo no Ura

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*ydwDxOhTwmaiSrD98FuVpg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*t__uaqL-NHuky3Ri3cR0qw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*L-jm3vDxb2-ZqtAmtvCHbA.jpeg)

By the time I returned to Tomo no Ura, it was nearing evening. I wandered down to the harbor to see the lanterns and the traditional Japanese town scenery. Along the way, I noticed many people and photography enthusiasts already sitting on the steps by the harbor, setting up their cameras and waiting for the sunset.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*SeorqAWQs7qe8YLMkXwdPA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*E3kD_XkOhHlG5FJSMQr7UQ.jpeg)

Tomo no Ura is famous for its nourishing medicinal sake, and the air was thick with the scent of the medicinal brew. Since I needed to head back to Hiroshima, I took the bus back to Fukuyama before it got dark.

Upon returning to Fukuyama, I hopped on the train to Hiroshima, bidding farewell to this peaceful city. For dinner, I picked up a takeout grilled meat bento from "[Sumibi Yakiniku Toshin Saruhashi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C1hjH3o1KZe9bFFx7){:target="_blank"}" on the way back to my hotel.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*4rgR6XxTqCj3Ttl36q1FnQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*eaZ-_Cby5JKRX4nzyJJNkA.jpeg)

I also added two deep-fried oysters from a convenience store (only 100 yen each).

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*E0hLC9VLo4tah6MgxOEqog.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*hZQQHGWrXR_hDRmEZ3EZhw.jpeg)

For a late-night snack, I had a convenience store hot meal for 1000 yen.

### Day 4: Final Tour of Kure City and Hiroshima City (Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, Hiroshima Castle, Shukkeien)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*WmcYfx8BQwNrVp_0SQJsEA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*vNoFiM5ZkznaCYLgdjHp7g.jpeg)

I checked out of the Toyoko Inn early in the morning and dragged my luggage to the APA Hotel in Hiroshima, where I would be staying that night.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*PthDRuEg7AES_KIzrFa-3A.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*GuEtFX9d9PA5Im7PLxkAcQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*ef6aepg-6ERDvr5jJlxZ9A.jpeg)

After dropping off my luggage, I walked back to Hiroshima Station to catch a train to Kure City (about a 50-minute ride). As we approached Kure City, looking out the right window gave me a nostalgic feeling reminiscent of the train routes in Fulong and Yilan, with mountains on the left and the sea on the right—very pleasant scenery.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*gYNCT8nC5xaQ5cd6DpzSGA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*_lyLdp5j60H-lRDZTBMURA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*YffE_SVn5hs9c3AwrLBkwA.jpeg)

After exiting the station, I went to the tourist information center to grab a travel guide for Kure City (which I thought was well-designed!).

Following the signs, I walked across the pedestrian bridge to the Yamato Museum and the Kure Maritime Museum.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*WWo4EbbEMpeXQBf8eY9dow.jpeg)

When I reached the end of the bridge, don’t rush to go down; you can get a great view of the Kure Maritime Museum from the bridge—submarines on display.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*c1BkFzWE_wr4tscbWg8hzQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*kPeWz4lsPF1vs4NzVNBneQ.jpeg)

> For those planning a trip to Kure City and Hiroshima, note that you can also take a boat to Miyajima and back to Hiroshima. I initially wanted to take the boat back to Hiroshima, but I missed the timing, so I decided to skip it this time.

#### Yamato Museum

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*E3npgh-TZU54G4E5JtN1jg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*3TVr3YFnVBEnzbWIlTZ9Ng.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Q5_HnmXY47mtRX7lEtFQkg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*TmwmLHTt94KRSZW6-G_Ehg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*mUYyUBQvTTx8mbQ2516W2w.jpeg)

Inside, there’s a battleship Yamato that you can view up close in 360 degrees, with details almost fully displayed, along with the history of battleships, wars, fighter planes, cannons, etc. It’s a must-visit for battleship and military enthusiasts. Additionally, I happened to catch a special exhibition on the design and development history of Japanese aircraft carriers, including design sketches.

#### Kure Maritime Museum

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*_G0SMX-74rgnIJtqQJWwvw.jpeg)

After leaving the Yamato Museum, I walked to the Kure Maritime Museum, which is free to enter.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*9BWAVAGIVbZ4va3NDMjo1A.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*ZBFyqDEU8IaNXIyJ0yAhOA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Pfdwz6cXtUPDyvpFZTscZw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Wi-vcHvcF-4RqQosTduksQ.jpeg)

The museum mainly showcases the living and working environments inside submarines, engines, torpedoes, and historical artifacts.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*44uKtTLacF4aXq6MPuFjhQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*u7Yog59KOjSAg0R2iWKHMg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*4iMtOOOgVBIbfmhHBiBwvw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*qaRVV4LFdCmfMoNjsLFNjg.jpeg)

The most special part is that you can actually enter a submarine and explore the real compartments, dormitories, captain's room, control room, and use the periscope to see the outside environment.

#### Kure City Shopping Street

After visiting the museums, it was close to noon, and I was ready to find something to eat. I initially wanted to try the navy curry, but after checking reviews, it didn’t seem particularly special, so I decided to walk back to Kure City Shopping Street to make a decision (it was quite a distance, and walking took about 30 minutes).

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*08ryfbJs_lMZqiAkj7r_0Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*TuYPPoADttJ1zWk716UK8A.jpeg)

In the end, I chose to have Kure cold noodles, which are similar to chilled noodles with pork bone chashu. The noodles are chilled and refreshing, and the portion is quite generous, so a small size would suffice.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*tvKWEChMpB9c1qyPqqsb0g.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*-mgVYo5H_JjdmXhMbplH2Q.jpeg)

After eating, I prepared to head back to the station. On the way, I also bought "Fukuzumi Fried Red Bean Cakes," which were a bit too sweet and oily, tasting quite ordinary. Additionally, I picked up some navy coffee and curry as souvenirs (the staff at [subarucoffee_store](https://www.instagram.com/subarucoffee_store/){:target="_blank"} were very friendly and enthusiastic).

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*_4hhVGYUBZvVOOhvQNVgpA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*nDnjMo8kQAXiCy8iF6Fb1Q.jpeg)

I walked back to Kure Station and took the train back to Hiroshima.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*SaD8AQMHzomL2DVlquj_0w.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*9W_382zPShaYzQWQAv_Z0Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*wUx4gtoAl8c7kBvhIXhe-w.jpeg)

After returning to Hiroshima, I embarked on my final tour of the city. Right outside Hiroshima Station, there are three routes of sightseeing buses available (included in the JR Pass), allowing you to choose based on your desired direction.

I decided to visit Shukkeien (Hiroshima Art Museum) first, so I took the red maple leaf bus.

#### Shukkeien

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*RIFGTX6ipG1G0uSlNsShcg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*cPpsmj5ff-TNM4yEWxExvA.jpeg)

Shukkeien is located right behind the Hiroshima Art Museum, and you can purchase a combined ticket for both Shukkeien and the museum.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*hEU5JheqeYqj8G06-RZyYQ.jpeg)

Shukkeien is a quaint little garden featuring many miniature landscapes, such as maple trees, small bridges, flowing water, bamboo groves, and hills. It’s quite nice to stroll around and enjoy the scenery.

#### Hiroshima Castle

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*yxTWLBwpKuf025kiuWemxw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*uWLykJP2_3VnKtZWZATAzQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*biTmLBV6gM3lZjproKG_eg.jpeg)

Next, I strolled to Hiroshima Castle. The original Hiroshima Castle was destroyed in the atomic bombing, and the current structure is a reconstruction. It looks quite new, but it’s not very tall, and the view from the keep isn’t particularly impressive.

#### Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum and Peace Memorial Park

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*sHMbGZ-XOt7yBqxjpN2wcQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*goGSippywpI5vVhdK1WHOg.jpeg)

Finally, I returned to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, right next to the [Children's Peace Monument (I didn’t go inside as it’s not very tall)](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/171128?cid=19365&ud1=31b9b3a63abc){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*ZhBQczjhytPZC-B9Wr_18A.jpeg)

I happened to encounter Shingo Katori paying his respects in the afternoon.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*-HqxYUWhkWiNWXnA20TtZg.jpeg)

I queued to buy a ticket to visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, which has a wealth of information about the atomic bombing, its history, and various artifacts and photographs. The overall experience was very heavy and impactful.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*kRBjSbNgdK5pEgtpkQi2BQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*2FHg46ebTbABH0Yn8Ju4pg.jpeg)

On the other side of the park, there’s a memorial hall, but it felt too heavy, so I didn’t go in.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*pl1v9-9TO7TXgaPC1wM0ew.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Xq6dIYI1LNr6CQ0oLjvGkQ.jpeg)

As evening fell, a light drizzle began, and combined with the somber feelings from just witnessing the painful lessons of history, I returned to Hiroshima Station.

I casually bought some souvenirs and takeout bento at the station before heading back to the hotel to rest. I still need to do laundry today.

![Image 1](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*piIFDZ1ag8ZJibvFii4H1g.jpeg)

![Image 4](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*w3QEBni6N5ItE9a1WLg4FA.jpeg)

At APA, the president is truly everywhere—president curry, president water, president's books...

The room density is as usual, with over 60 rooms on each floor.

[![APA Hotel Hiroshima Station Front Bridge](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/f242_hqdefault.jpg "APA Hotel Hiroshima Station Front Bridge")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDYgKi202Nw){:target="_blank"}

The room is still small but well-equipped, and the electronic facilities are very convenient (you can see the laundry room status from your room, and the TV supports AirPlay).

![Image 5](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*qbZZmp07pwCA7Ezkq3zulw.jpeg)

![Image 6](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*KzVXPr1_w_0NLQ-UjsAuAw.png)

![Image 7](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*7w-qojYRysDghAlXytA84w.jpeg)

I ran into a big hassle while doing laundry—there was a long line. With over 1,000 rooms in the building and only 7 washing machines, I had to time it just right. I went downstairs to queue when the washing machine was almost done, and finally finished washing and drying my clothes around 11 PM (they weren't dry yet, so I hung them up in my room).

Since it got so late, having a late-night snack was reasonable! I went for a Y1000 meal plus milk and some convenience store hot food.

### Day 5: Kurashiki, Okayama

The morning was beautiful and sunny. I checked out of the hotel and said goodbye to Hiroshima, heading to the hotel in Kurashiki to drop off my luggage (I could also leave it in Okayama since I had to go through Okayama to get to Kurashiki).

#### Kurashiki Bikan Historical Quarter, Achi Shrine

![Image 14](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*qejzHASiMgjfpezApmZIeQ.jpeg)

My first stop was Achi Shrine, which is situated at a higher elevation and offers a panoramic view of the entire Kurashiki area. It was quite serene with not many people around.

Achi Shrine is small but famous for its ema (votive tablets) pavilion. If you draw a bad fortune, you can tie it under the corresponding animal head based on your zodiac sign. They also have a charm for good relationships called [Hanachandori](https://supertaste.tvbs.com.tw/asia/340177){:target="_blank"}:

The Bikan area is not large but very tranquil and pleasant to stroll around. Unfortunately, the boat tours were sold out for the day, so I missed that experience, but walking around the nearby alleys was still enjoyable.

![Image 29](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*hR5CK8dXU_EQCZto6wMjRA.jpeg)

For lunch, I had a famous curry set at [Miyake Shoten](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qdRm9RU7wzMbC8VVA){:target="_blank"}. The rich curry paired with burdock strips was delicious.

After eating, I continued to explore. When I got tired, I went to [Parlor Fruit Komachi](http://www.kurashiki-yoimachi.co.jp/yoimachi/parlor.html){:target="_blank"} (the unique feature is that the staff wear Taisho-era maid outfits) for a fruit sundae with Okayama's famous "Seiou" grapes and fruit ice cream. The grapes were incredibly sweet.

![Image 30](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*DSiupZVfIcI70EvWLnIwyw.jpeg)

For souvenirs, I found [GOHOBI](https://setouchifinder.com/tw/detail/10118){:target="_blank"}, a collagen jelly made from Okayama fruits.

#### Okayama Korakuen Light Up, Okayama Castle

![Image 33](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*YpHCUtOyGE31IdDk5tESjg.jpeg)

As the sun set, I took the train back to Okayama Station. Upon exiting, I hopped on a streetcar that took me to the area around Okayama Castle.

![Image 39](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*3W_9TpZVHOkjYBoMTUK8kg.jpeg)

First, I visited Okayama Korakuen, which looked incredibly romantic and beautiful with its evening lights.

![Image 41](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*qpVyBqyJ22Yc8xz90jTYbw.jpeg)

I then headed to Okayama Castle next door to enjoy the night view, which was beautifully illuminated by the lights reflecting off the autumn leaves.

![Image 42](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*wgkvVMoF6RNu8L7HMYPfAA.jpeg)

For dinner, I opted for a quick meal at Ippudo Ramen and then took a leisurely stroll back to Okayama Station (the path was also lit up beautifully). I still had some time before heading back to Kurashiki, so I stopped by a discount store (Don Quijote), but they didn't have many souvenirs. I realized I needed to go to Okayama Station or a department store to find more souvenirs...

![Image 43](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*L__YY34o5cD496fP69vC3A.jpeg)

![Image 45](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*spjr7DRx25wkmWsIE5uweQ.jpeg)

By the time I returned to Kurashiki, it was already evening, and the weather was cold. People on the street were hurrying home, and the outlet mall behind Kurashiki Station was already closed.

![Image 46](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*NI5gnc0wOJ8l2cNZj514_w.jpeg)

![Image 48](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*LTL2XIJrTkia851qe7ygAQ.jpeg)

I then realized that this hotel doesn't have a 24-hour front desk, but thankfully I didn't return too late! The room was well-equipped, with a microwave, kettle, and even a glasses cleaning machine.

On my last night in Japan, I simply had convenience store chicken nuggets for Y1000 and bought an extra bottle of white peach strawberry milk as a late-night snack before drifting off to sleep.

### Day 6: Okayama, Return Trip

![Image 53](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*1kyJvOpLI3ihAU6mMtHzQQ.jpeg)

Early in the morning, just as dawn broke, I checked out and headed to Okayama.

![Image 54](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Hm1kET2fwTNqTmDCLySGTg.png)

![Image 55](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*0cTmOAzxc5q4mlqsWjBogA.jpeg)

> I planned to take the airport shuttle from Okayama. **There is also a direct bus from Kurashiki to Okayama Airport, but the frequency is lower ( [for details, please refer to the official website](https://www.okayama-airport.org/tw/access/bus){:target="_blank"} )**. Since I hadn't finished exploring Okayama yesterday, I decided to head straight there before returning.

#### Kibitsu Shrine

![Image 56](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*kxqSXDcfqv7tu5hxVFCRVg.jpeg)

![Image 57](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*0xcVFXMOHrhMQcIbGUB93w.jpeg)

![Image 61](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*U77ZXlz-x3-e-HtTLAWCeg.jpeg)

After getting off the train, I headed straight to Kibitsu Shrine (about a 30-minute ride). After getting off the train, it takes about another 15 minutes to walk there. The shrine features a historic cypress wood corridor, ginkgo trees, and historical buildings, making it a pleasant place to visit.

There is also another shrine, Kibitsuhiko Shrine, located on the other side of the mountain, which can be visited along the way, but due to time constraints, I skipped it this time.

#### Okayama AEON

![Image 62](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*3IYXW1HHV8srIHTuJBdMRw.jpeg)

![Image 63](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*bykuAeRM2sLnRScqhlwBWQ.jpeg)

![Image 64](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*ckSyNw4EkKDtUODyWDHR2Q.jpeg)

After returning to Okayama Station, I went to the nearby AEON department store to buy some souvenirs, do some shopping, and have a lunch of tempura soba before preparing to queue for the airport shuttle back to Okayama Airport.

![Image 65](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*CAALyqb2A1jEQnURiQF3mQ.png)

![Image 66](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*fJNiCtsSsRnjPOvSzN2Oig.jpeg)

> **There were many people waiting for the shuttle, but there's no need to worry about not getting on, as they will add extra trips to ensure everyone gets to the airport.**

#### Okayama Momotaro Airport (OKJ)

The airport is a bit dated and small, similar to Kumamoto Airport. I completed security checks, check-in, and immigration by around 13:50, with nearly two hours left before my flight at 15:25.

![Image 67](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*DBRSEVhlkEWmssAlqhcySw.jpeg)

![Image 68](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*3YCu2TUlMXp6W95RtQsGnQ.jpeg)

The airport has very few flights, and since there were only people on the same flight, I finished check-in and baggage drop in less than 15 minutes. Interestingly, Okayama Airport is so small that the X-ray machine is located in the airport lobby. After passing through the X-ray, you get a seal before going to check-in (if you open your luggage, you will be asked to go through security again).

![Image 71](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*aIb2fL4eCvk4FsNldk2tSg.jpeg)

After dropping off my luggage, I wandered around the terminal (there are only two floors). There is an observation deck, a café, and a few restaurants to eat at. When I got tired, I bought a white peach ice cream to enjoy.

![Image 72](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*AV0wiyIjyHbm4LJ4DO8QOQ.jpeg)

Security checks were also quick, but if you're wearing boots at Okayama Airport, you need to take them off for security, which is a bit inconvenient.

I encountered a flight delay and waited in the departure lounge until 16:24 when we finally took off (almost an hour late).

#### Souvenir Unboxing

#### Interlude

After my previous trip, "[10-Day Solo Trip in Kyushu 2023](../d78e0b15a08a/)," I experienced an indescribable sense of loneliness in the following days. It was partly due to being alone in an unfamiliar place and not speaking Japanese for 10 days, which meant I hardly talked to anyone. That feeling of loneliness is still fresh in my memory, so I wasn't particularly eager to travel again. However, I ended up going because I had to work soon and found an incredibly cheap flight.

On the first day, while exchanging my JR Pass, I happened to get stuck and met a group of fellow Taiwanese travelers who were also stuck. We took turns trying to figure it out until we succeeded. Coincidentally, one of them was also heading to Hiroshima, and she reminded me when I got stuck at the entrance. We all ended up on the same train, and since we were in the same industry, we had plenty to talk about. We were all traveling alone, so we ended up forming a group and completing the same itinerary together on the first day.

> **Many of the itineraries, attractions, and time arrangements were provided by Angie. If I had been on my own, I might have wandered aimlessly or missed out on things, and then I would have ended up walking alone for six days.**
