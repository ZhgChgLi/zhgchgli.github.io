### Seamless Migration from Medium to Self-Hosted Website

Migrating Medium content to Github Pages (with Jekyll/Chirpy)

### Background

In my fourth year of managing Medium, I have accumulated over 65 articles and nearly 1000+ hours of effort. The reason I chose Medium initially was its simplicity and convenience, allowing me to focus on writing without worrying about other matters. Before this, I had tried self-hosting WordPress, but I found myself preoccupied with setting up the environment, styles, and plugins, feeling dissatisfied no matter how I adjusted things. After getting everything set up, I discovered slow loading times, poor reading experiences, and an unuser-friendly backend for writing articles, which led to infrequent updates.

As I wrote more articles on Medium and accumulated some traffic and followers, I began to desire control over these achievements rather than being at the mercy of a third-party platform (e.g., losing all my work if Medium shuts down). Therefore, since the year before last, I have been searching for a secondary backup website. I would continue to manage Medium but also publish content on a site I could control. The solution I found at that time was — [Google Site](../724a7fb9a364/), but honestly, it could only serve as a personal "portal," with limited functionality for writing articles, making it impossible to truly migrate all my work.

Ultimately, I returned to the path of self-hosting, but this time I opted for a static website instead of a dynamic one (e.g., WordPress). While the features supported are fewer, what I wanted was the ability to write articles and a clean, smooth, customizable browsing experience—nothing more!

The workflow for a static website is: write articles in Markdown format locally, then convert them into static web pages using a static site generator and upload them to the server, completing the process; static web pages provide a fast browsing experience!

Writing in Markdown format allows articles to be compatible with more platforms. If you're not accustomed to it, you can find online or offline Markdown writing tools that provide an experience similar to writing directly on Medium!

In summary, this solution meets my needs for both a smooth browsing experience and a convenient writing interface.

### Installing Ruby

Here, I will use my environment as an example. For other operating system versions, please refer to [Google how to install Ruby](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/){:target="_blank"}.
- macOS Monterey 12.1
- rbenv
- ruby 2.6.5

#### Install [Brew](https://brew.sh/index_zh-tw){:target="_blank"}
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Enter the above command in Terminal to install Brew.
#### Install [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv){:target="_blank"}
```bash
brew install rbenv ruby-build
```

Although macOS comes with Ruby, it is recommended to use rbenv to install another version of Ruby separate from the system's built-in version. Enter the above command in Terminal to install rbenv.
```bash
rbenv init
```

Enter the above command in Terminal to initialize rbenv.
- **Close & reopen Terminal.**

Enter `rbenv` in Terminal to check if the installation was successful!

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*uVcwZLxSUZymjxILlXyNcw.png)

**Success!**
#### Use rbenv to install Ruby
```bash
rbenv install 2.6.5
```

Enter the above command in Terminal to install Ruby version 2.6.5.
```bash
rbenv global 2.6.5
```

Enter the above command in Terminal to switch the Ruby version used by Terminal from the system's built-in version to the rbenv version.

Enter `rbenv versions` in Terminal to check the current settings:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*AJXLDusJQ7XJQjWHQOqWGA.png)

Enter `ruby -v` in Terminal to check the current Ruby version, and `gem -v` to check the current RubyGems status:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*ANyW3uysaKSiySTDGi28gw.png)

> \*After Ruby is installed, [RubyGems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems){:target="_blank"} should also be installed.

**Success!**
#### Install Jekyll & Bundler & ZMediumToMarkdown
```bash
gem install jekyll bundler ZMediumToMarkdown
```

Enter the above command in Terminal to install Jekyll, Bundler, and ZMediumToMarkdown.

**Done!**
### Create a Jekyll Blog from a Template

The default Jekyll Blog style is very simple. We can find styles we like and apply them from the following websites:
- [GitHub.com #jekyll-theme repos](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme){:target="_blank"}
- [jamstackthemes.dev](https://jamstackthemes.dev/ssg/jekyll/){:target="_blank"}
- [jekyllthemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org/){:target="_blank"}
- [jekyllthemes.io](https://jekyllthemes.io/){:target="_blank"}
- [jekyll-themes.com](https://jekyll-themes.com/){:target="_blank"}

The installation method generally uses [gem-based themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#installing-a-theme){:target="_blank"}, and some repos provide installation via Fork; some even offer a one-click installation method. In any case, the installation method for each template may vary, so please refer to the template's usage instructions.

> Additionally, please note that since we are deploying to GitHub Pages, not all templates may be suitable according to the official documentation.

```markdown
### Chirpy Template

Here, I will demonstrate using the template [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/){:target="_blank"} that I adopted for my blog. This template offers the simplest one-click installation method for direct use.

> Other templates rarely provide a similar one-click installation. Using this template is a better way to get started if you are unfamiliar with Jekyll or GitHub Pages. I will update the article later to discuss other template installation methods.

> Additionally, you can find templates on GitHub that can be directly forked (e.g., [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio){:target="_blank"}). If none of these options work, you will need to manually install the template and research how to set up GitHub Pages deployment. I did some research on this but was unsuccessful; I will return to update the article once I have results to share.

#### Create Git Repo from Git Template

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*XRaln4SJiK-la32HhSYPug.png)

[https://github\.com/cotes2020/chirpy\-starter/generate](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter/generate){:target="_blank"}
- Repository name: `Github帳號/組織名稱.github.io` ( **Be sure to use this format** )
- Make sure to select "Public" for the repository

Click "Create repository from template"

The repository is created.

#### Git Clone the Project

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*cQUPBm6tzyceXV-iwY5rzw.png)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zhgchgli0718/zhgchgli0718.github.io.git
```

Clone the repository you just created.

Run `bundle` to install dependencies:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*4ebE2NABGtRbKvc75e6aLA.png)

Run `bundle lock — add-platform x86_64-linux` to lock the version.

> ⚠️ Changes to `_config.yml` require a restart of the local site for the effects to take place!

#### Preview the Site

After the dependencies are installed,

you can start the local site by running `bundle exec jekyll s`:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*f9xi6k6NCjesF0YtgjvogQ.png)

Copy the URL `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` and paste it into your browser to open.

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*BSUbXFi082ZkHil2cWV2BQ.png)

**Local preview successful!**

As long as this Terminal is open, the local site will be running, and the Terminal will continuously update the site access logs, making it easier for us to debug.

We can open another new Terminal for subsequent operations.

### Jekyll Directory Structure

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*Rf8A-Y36J1oy6rwG1Crt8w.png)

Depending on the template, there may be different folders and configuration files. The article directory is:
- **\_posts/**: Articles will be placed in this directory.
Article file naming convention: `YYYY` – `MM` – `DD` - `article_file_name`.md
- **assets/**: 
The directory for website resources, where images for the website or **images within articles** should be placed.

Other directories like \_includes, \_layouts, \_sites, \_tabs… allow you to make advanced modifications.

Jekyll uses [Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/){:target="_blank"} as the page template engine, and the page templates are composed in a manner similar to inheritance:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*g9n4qBgEWb_ErOOwqrUC6Q.jpeg)

Users can freely customize pages. The engine will first check if the user has created a corresponding customized file -> If not, it will check if the template has one -> If not, it will use the original Jekyll style for presentation.

Thus, we can easily customize any page by simply creating a file with the same name in the corresponding directory!

### Create/Edit Articles
- We can first delete all example article files in the `_posts/` directory.

Use [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} (free) or [Typora](https://typora.io/){:target="_blank"} (paid) to create Markdown files. Here, we will use [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} as an example:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*5xgNYYYQXHylU6GV_akGfQ.png)

- Article file naming convention: `YYYY` – `MM` – `DD` - `article_file_name`.md
- It is recommended to use English for the file name (for SEO optimization), as this name will be the path of the URL.

### Download Articles from Medium and Convert to Markdown for Jekyll

With a basic understanding of Jekyll, we continue forward by using the [ZMediumToMarkdown](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"} tool to download existing articles from Medium and convert them into Markdown format to place in our Blog folder.


[![](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/493527574/9b5b7025-cc95-4e81-84a9-b38706093c27)](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"}


After navigating to the blog directory, run the following command to download all articles from the specified Medium user:
```bash
ZMediumToMarkdown -j your Medium account
```


![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*cOFDZUWbpslzO975nT1QAg.png)


Wait for all articles to finish downloading...


> If you encounter any download issues or unexpected errors, feel free to [contact me](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"}; this downloader is written by me \( [development insights](../ddd88a84e177/) \), and can quickly help you resolve issues. 






![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*5UfA22gZLQBXSc5jXgCmlg.png)


Once the download is complete, you can preview the results on your local website.


![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*1Qg8jGrPc5tDRI4tZ1B5dg.png)


**Done!! We have seamlessly imported Medium articles into Jekyll!**

You can check if the articles are formatted correctly and if any images are missing. If there are any issues, feel free to [report them to me](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"} for assistance in fixing them.
### Upload Content to Repo

Once the local preview content is confirmed to be fine, we will push the content to the GitHub Repo.

Use the following Git commands in sequence:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "update post"
git push
```

After pushing, return to GitHub, and you will see that Actions are running CD again:


![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*UV9_80VRsMvmLtYJVpTrog.png)


Wait for about 5 minutes…


![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*ZvVHhaIcZjUZgvtUkFte5w.png)


Deployment complete!
#### Initial Deployment Settings

After the first deployment is complete, you need to change the following settings:


![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*enRTr0wapljkC7pi-qJ91g.png)


Otherwise, visiting the website will only show:
```
--- layout: home # Index page ---
```

After clicking "Save," it will not take effect immediately; you need to return to the "Actions" page and wait for the deployment to restart.

Once the redeployment is complete, you will be able to successfully access the website:


![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*YvIOSgW9sQ14UIWUMFTJww.png)


Demo -> [zhgchg\.li](https://zhgchg.li/){:target="_blank"}

Now you also have a free Jekyll personal blog!!
#### About Deployment

Every time you push content to the Repo, it will trigger a redeployment. You need to wait for the deployment to succeed for the changes to take effect.
### Bind Custom Domain

If you do not like the [zhgchgli0718\.github\.io](https://zhgchgli0718.github.io/){:target="_blank"} GitHub URL, you can purchase a domain you like from [Namecheap](https://namecheap.pxf.io/P0jdZQ){:target="_blank"} or use [Dot\.tk](http://dot.tk/en/index.html?lang=en){:target="_blank"} to register a free .tk domain.
```


After purchasing the domain, go to the domain backend:

Add the following four Type A Record entries
```
A Record @ 185.199.108.153
A Record @ 185.199.109.153
A Record @ 185.199.110.153
A Record @ 185.199.111.153
```


![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*29e7AxJnZpnrNbniRMtkKg.png)


After adding the settings in the domain backend, return to the GitHub Repo Settings:


![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*Q-FB7x5j9t-Q6QKW6LFTow.png)


In the Custom domain field, enter your domain and then click "Save".


![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*ZlXEv-g-W58sbe7lfnT1kQ.png)


Once the DNS is propagated, you can replace the original github\.io URL with zhgchg\.li.


> ⚠️ DNS settings may take at least 5 minutes to 72 hours to take effect. If authentication fails repeatedly, please try again later. 




### Cloud, Fully Automated Medium Synchronization Mechanism

Every time there is a new article, you have to manually run [ZMediumToMarkdown](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"} on your computer and then push it to the project. Is that cumbersome?

[ZMediumToMarkdown](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"} actually provides a convenient [GitHub Action feature](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/zmediumtomarkdown-automatic-bot){:target="_blank"} that allows you to free your computer and automatically synchronize Medium articles to your website.

**Go to the Repo's Actions settings:**


![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*DioRzBToaaSmYzccOrCwBw.png)


Click "New workflow"


![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*jGkqhcqk-H7_cCWWZwVNzg.png)


Click "set up a workflow yourself"


![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*vA7YX2umOfis2pSUxlR60Q.png)

- Change the file name to: `ZMediumToMarkdown.yml`
- The file content is as follows:

```yaml
name: ZMediumToMarkdown
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:

After running, it will also trigger a redeployment. Once the redeployment is complete, the latest content will appear on the website. 🚀

> No manual operation is required at all! This means that in the future, you can continue to update your Medium articles, and the script will automatically help you sync the content from the cloud to your own website!
