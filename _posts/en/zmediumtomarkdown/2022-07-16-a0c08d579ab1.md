### Seamless Migration from Medium to a Self-Hosted Website

Moving Medium Content to Github Pages (with Jekyll/Chirpy)

### Background

In my fourth year of running Medium, I have accumulated over 65 articles and nearly 1000+ hours of effort. The reason I chose Medium initially was its simplicity and convenience, allowing me to focus on writing without worrying about other issues. Before this, I tried self-hosting WordPress, but I spent most of my time dealing with the environment, themes, and plugins. No matter how I adjusted, I was never satisfied. After making changes, I found the loading speed too slow, the reading experience poor, and the backend writing interface not user-friendly, so I stopped updating it frequently.

As I wrote more articles on Medium and gained some traffic and followers, I started wanting to control these achievements myself, rather than being controlled by a third-party platform (e.g., losing everything if Medium shuts down). So, since the year before last, I have been looking for a secondary backup website. I will continue to maintain Medium but also publish content simultaneously on a site I control. The solution I found back then was — [Google Site](../724a7fb9a364/) but honestly, it can only serve as a personal "portal" site. The article writing interface is limited and cannot fully transfer all my articles.

In the end, I returned to self-hosting, but instead of using a dynamic website (e.g., WordPress), I chose a static website. Although it supports fewer features, what I need is just the article writing function and a simple, smooth, customizable browsing experience—nothing else!

The workflow of a static website is: write articles in Markdown format locally, then convert them into static web pages using a static site generator and upload them to the server; done. Static web pages provide a fast browsing experience!

Writing in Markdown format allows your article to be compatible with more platforms; if you're not used to it, you can also find online or offline Markdown editors, which offer an experience similar to writing directly on Medium!

In summary, this solution can achieve both the smooth browsing experience and the convenient writing interface I desire.

### Installing Ruby

Here, I only use my environment as an example. For other operating system versions, please [Google how to install Ruby](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/){:target="_blank"}.

- macOS Monterey 12.1

- rbenv

- ruby 2.6.5

#### Install [Brew](https://brew.sh/index_zh-tw){:target="_blank"}

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Enter the above command in Terminal to install Brew.

#### Install [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv){:target="_blank"}

```bash
brew install rbenv ruby-build
```

Although MacOS comes with Ruby pre-installed, it is recommended to use rbenv to install a separate Ruby version to keep it isolated from the system default. Enter the above command in Terminal to install rbenv.

```bash
rbenv init
```

Enter the above command in Terminal to initialize rbenv

- **Close & Reopen Terminal.**

Type `rbenv` in the Terminal to check if the installation was successful!

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*uVcwZLxSUZymjxILlXyNcw.png)

**Success!**

#### Installing Ruby with rbenv

```bash
rbenv install 2.6.5
```

Enter the above command in Terminal to install Ruby version 2.6.5.

```bash
rbenv global 2.6.5
```

Enter the above command in Terminal to switch the Ruby version used by Terminal from the system default to the rbenv version.

In the Terminal, type `rbenv versions` to check the current settings:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*AJXLDusJQ7XJQjWHQOqWGA.png)

In Terminal, enter `ruby -v` to check the current Ruby version, and `gem -v` to check the current RubyGems version:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*ANyW3uysaKSiySTDGi28gw.png)

> * After installing Ruby, [RubyGems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems){:target="_blank"} should also be installed.

**Success!**

#### Install Jekyll & Bundler & ZMediumToMarkdown

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler ZMediumToMarkdown
```

Enter the above commands in Terminal to install Jekyll, Bundler, and ZMediumToMarkdown.

**Completed!**

### Create a Jekyll Blog from a Template

The default Jekyll Blog style is very simple. We can find styles we like from the following websites and apply them:

- [GitHub.com #jekyll-theme repos](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme){:target="_blank"}

- [jamstackthemes.dev](https://jamstackthemes.dev/ssg/jekyll/){:target="_blank"}

- [jekyllthemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org/){:target="_blank"}

- [jekyllthemes.io](https://jekyllthemes.io/){:target="_blank"}

- [jekyll-themes.com](https://jekyll-themes.com/){:target="_blank"}

The installation method generally uses [gem-based themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#installing-a-theme){:target="_blank"}. Some repositories offer installation via Fork; others provide one-click installation. In short, each theme may have a different installation method, so please refer to the theme's instructions.

> Also note that since we are deploying to GitHub Pages, not all templates are supported according to the official documentation.

### Chirpy Template

Here, I will use the template [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/){:target="_blank"} adopted by my blog as an example. This template offers the simplest one-click installation method and can be used directly.

> Other templates rarely offer similar one-click installation. For those unfamiliar with Jekyll or GitHub Pages, using this template first is a better way to get started. Future articles may cover installation methods for other templates.

> Alternatively, you can find templates on Github that can be directly forked (e.g. [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio){:target="_blank"}) and used immediately. If none suit your needs and you have to manually install a template, you will need to figure out how to set up Github Pages deployment yourself. I tried researching this but was unsuccessful; I will update this article with my findings in the future.

#### Create a Git Repo from a Git Template

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*XRaln4SJiK-la32HhSYPug.png)

<https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter/generate>{:target="_blank"}

- Repository name: `GithubUsername/OrganizationName.github.io` ( **Be sure to use this format** )

- Be sure to select "Public" to make the Repo public.

Click "Create repository from template"

Repository creation completed.

#### Git Clone Project

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*cQUPBm6tzyceXV-iwY5rzw.png)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zhgchgli0718/zhgchgli0718.github.io.git
```

git clone the newly created Repo.

Run `bundle` to install dependencies:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*4ebE2NABGtRbKvc75e6aLA.png)

Run `bundle lock — add-platform x86_64-linux` to lock the version

> ⚠️ Changes to _config.yml require restarting the local website to take effect!

#### Preview Website

After dependency installation is complete,

You can start the local site with `bundle exec jekyll s`:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*f9xi6k6NCjesF0YtgjvogQ.png)

Copy the URL `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` and paste it into your browser to open.

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*BSUbXFi082ZkHil2cWV2BQ.png)

**Local Preview Successful!**

With this Terminal open, the local website stays running. The Terminal continuously updates the website access logs, making debugging easier.

We can open a new Terminal to perform other subsequent operations.

### Jekyll Directory Structure

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*Rf8A-Y36J1oy6rwG1Crt8w.png)

Depending on the template, there may be different folders and configuration files. The article directory is at:

- **_posts/**: Articles will be placed in this directory  
  Article file naming convention: `YYYY` – `MM` – `DD` - `article-file-name`.md

- **assets/**:  
  Directory for website resources. Images used on the website or **images within articles** should be placed here.

Other directories like _includes, _layouts, _sites, _tabs… allow you to make advanced extensions and modifications.

Jekyll uses [Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/){:target="_blank"} as its page template engine. The page templates are composed in a way similar to inheritance:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*g9n4qBgEWb_ErOOwqrUC6Q.jpeg)

Users can freely customize pages. The engine first checks if the user has created a custom file for the page -> if not, it checks the template -> if not, it uses the original Jekyll style.

So we can easily customize any page by simply creating a file with the same name in the corresponding directory!

### Create/Edit Article

- We can first delete all example article files under the `_posts/` directory.

Use [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} (free) or [Typora](https://typora.io/){:target="_blank"} (paid) to create a Markdown file. Here, we use [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} as an example:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*5xgNYYYQXHylU6GV_akGfQ.png)

- Article file naming convention: `YYYY` – `MM` – `DD` - `ArticleFileName` .md

- It is recommended to use English for file names (SEO optimization), as this name will become the URL path.

Article **Content Top Meta**:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title:  "Hello"
description: ZhgChgLi's first article
date:   2022-07-16 10:03:36 +0800
categories: Jeklly Life
author: ZhgChgLi
tags: [ios]

```

- layout: post

- title: Article Title (og:title)

- description: Article description (og:description)

- date: Article publication date (cannot be in the future)

- author: Author (meta:author)

- tags: Tags (multiple allowed)

- categories: Categories (single, separate subcategories with spaces, e.g., `Jeklly Life` means the Life folder under the Jeklly directory)

Please provide the Markdown paragraphs you want me to translate into English.

Write using [Markdown](https://dillinger.io/){:target="_blank"} format:

```markdown

### Download Articles from Medium and Convert to Markdown for Jekyll

With basic Jekyll knowledge, let's move forward by using the [ZMediumToMarkdown](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"} tool to download existing articles from the Medium website and convert them into Markdown format to place in our Blog folder.

[![](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/493527574/9b5b7025-cc95-4e81-84a9-b38706093c27)](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"}

After changing directory to the blog folder, run the following command to download all articles from the user on Medium:

```bash
ZMediumToMarkdown -j Your Medium account
```

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*cOFDZUWbpslzO975nT1QAg.png)

Waiting for all articles to finish downloading...

> If you encounter any download issues or unexpected errors, feel free to [contact me](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"}. This downloader was created by me ( [development insights](../ddd88a84e177/) ) and can help you resolve problems quickly and directly.

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*5UfA22gZLQBXSc5jXgCmlg.png)

After the download is complete, return to the local website to preview the results.

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*1Qg8jGrPc5tDRI4tZ1B5dg.png)

**Done!! We have seamlessly imported the Medium article into Jekyll!**

Please check if the article layout is broken or if any images are missing. If so, feel free to [report to me](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"} for assistance with fixing it.

### Upload Content to Repo

After confirming the local preview is fine, we will push the content to the Github repo.

Use the following Git commands in order:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "update post"
git push
```

After the push is complete, return to GitHub to see the Actions running the CD again:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*UV9_80VRsMvmLtYJVpTrog.png)

Wait about 5 minutes...

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*ZvVHhaIcZjUZgvtUkFte5w.png)

Deployment complete!

#### Initial Deployment and Setup Completed

After the initial deployment, update the following settings:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*enRTr0wapljkC7pi-qJ91g.png)

Otherwise, visiting the website will only show:

```
--- layout: home # Index page ---
```

After clicking "Save," the changes won't take effect immediately. You need to go back to the "Actions" page and wait for the deployment again.

After redeployment, you can successfully access the website:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*YvIOSgW9sQ14UIWUMFTJww.png)

Demo -> [zhgchg.li](https://zhgchg.li/){:target="_blank"}

You now also have a free personal Jekyll Blog!!

#### About Deployment

Every time content is pushed to the repo, it triggers a redeployment. You must wait for the deployment to succeed before the changes take effect.

### Bind a Custom Domain

If you don't like the [zhgchgli0718.github.io](https://zhgchgli0718.github.io/){:target="_blank"} Github URL, you can buy a domain you like from [Namecheap](https://namecheap.pxf.io/P0jdZQ){:target="_blank"} or register a free .tk domain using [Dot.tk](http://dot.tk/en/index.html?lang=en){:target="_blank"}.

After purchasing the domain, enter the domain backend:

Add the following four Type A Record entries

```
A Record @ 185.199.108.153
A Record @ 185.199.109.153
A Record @ 185.199.110.153
A Record @ 185.199.111.153
```

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*29e7AxJnZpnrNbniRMtkKg.png)

After adding and configuring the domain backend, go back to Github Repo Settings:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*Q-FB7x5j9t-Q6QKW6LFTow.png)

Enter your domain in the Custom domain field, then click "Save."

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*ZlXEv-g-W58sbe7lfnT1kQ.png)

After the DNS is resolved, you can use zhgchg.li to replace the original github.io URL.

> ⚠️ DNS settings take at least 5 minutes and up to 72 hours to take effect. If verification keeps failing, please try again later.

### Cloud-Based, Fully Automated Medium Synchronization Mechanism

Every time there is a new article, do you have to manually run [ZMediumToMarkdown](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"} on your computer and then push it to the project? Finding it troublesome?

[ZMediumToMarkdown](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"} also offers a convenient [Github Action feature](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/zmediumtomarkdown-automatic-bot){:target="_blank"}, allowing you to free your computer and automatically sync Medium articles to your website.

**Go to the Actions settings of the Repo:**

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*DioRzBToaaSmYzccOrCwBw.png)

Click "New workflow"

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*jGkqhcqk-H7_cCWWZwVNzg.png)

Click "set up a workflow yourself"

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*vA7YX2umOfis2pSUxlR60Q.png)

- Rename the file to: `ZMediumToMarkdown.yml`

- The file content is as follows:

```yaml
name: ZMediumToMarkdown
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: "10 1 15 * *" # At 01:10 on day-of-month 15.

jobs:

After running, it will also trigger a redeployment. Once redeployment is complete, the latest content will appear on the website. 🚀

> No manual operation needed at all! This means you can continue updating your Medium articles in the future, and the script will automatically and thoughtfully sync the content from the cloud to your own website!
