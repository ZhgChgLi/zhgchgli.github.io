### Seamless Migration from Medium to Self-Hosted Website

Migrating Medium content to GitHub Pages (with Jekyll/Chirpy)

### Background

After running my Medium account for four years and accumulating over 65 articles, I realized I had invested nearly 1000 hours into it. I initially chose Medium for its simplicity and convenience, allowing me to focus on writing without worrying about other aspects. Before that, I had tried self-hosting with WordPress, but I found myself spending too much time on environment setup, styling, and plugins. No matter how I adjusted things, I was never satisfied. Once I got everything set up, I discovered slow loading times, poor reading experiences, and an unintuitive backend for writing articles, which led to infrequent updates.

As I wrote more articles on Medium and gained some traffic and followers, I began to desire control over my content rather than relying on a third-party platform (e.g., losing all my work if Medium shut down). Therefore, I started looking for a secondary backup site two years ago. I planned to continue using Medium while also publishing content on a site I could control. At that time, I found a solution in [Google Sites](../724a7fb9a364/), but honestly, it was only suitable as a personal "portal" with limited article writing features, making it impossible to transfer all my hard work.

Ultimately, I returned to self-hosting, but this time I opted for a static website instead of a dynamic one (e.g., WordPress). While static sites support fewer features, I wanted a writing function and a clean, customizable browsing experience—nothing more!

The workflow for a static website is straightforward: write articles locally in Markdown format, then convert them into static web pages using a static site generator and upload them to the server. This results in fast-loading static pages and a great browsing experience!

Writing in Markdown format allows for compatibility across various platforms. If you're not used to it, you can find online or offline Markdown writing tools that provide an experience similar to writing directly on Medium.

In summary, this solution meets my needs for a smooth browsing experience and a convenient writing interface.

### Installing Ruby

Here’s an example based on my environment; please [Google how to install Ruby](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/){:target="_blank"} for other operating systems.
- macOS Monterey 12.1
- rbenv
- ruby 2.6.5

#### Install [Brew](https://brew.sh/index_zh-tw){:target="_blank"}
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Enter the above command in Terminal to install Brew.

#### Install [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv){:target="_blank"}
```bash
brew install rbenv ruby-build
```

Although macOS comes with Ruby, it’s recommended to use rbenv to install a separate version of Ruby. Enter the above command in Terminal to install rbenv.
```bash
rbenv init
```

Enter the above command in Terminal to initialize rbenv.
- **Close and reopen Terminal.**

In Terminal, enter `rbenv` to check if the installation was successful!

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*uVcwZLxSUZymjxILlXyNcw.png)

**Success!**

#### Use rbenv to Install Ruby
```bash
rbenv install 2.6.5
```

Enter the above command in Terminal to install Ruby version 2.6.5.
```bash
rbenv global 2.6.5
```

Enter the above command in Terminal to switch the Ruby version used in Terminal from the system version to the rbenv version.

In Terminal, enter `rbenv versions` to check the current settings:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*AJXLDusJQ7XJQjWHQOqWGA.png)

In Terminal, enter `ruby -v` to check the current Ruby version and `gem -v` to check the current RubyGems status:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*ANyW3uysaKSiySTDGi28gw.png)

> *Ruby should also have installed [RubyGems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems){:target="_blank"} by default.

**Success!**

#### Install Jekyll, Bundler, and ZMediumToMarkdown
```bash
gem install jekyll bundler ZMediumToMarkdown
```

Enter the above command in Terminal to install Jekyll, Bundler, and ZMediumToMarkdown.

**Done!**

### Create a Jekyll Blog from a Template

The default Jekyll Blog style is very simple. You can find a style you like from the following websites and apply it:
- [GitHub\.com \#jekyll\-theme repos](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme){:target="_blank"}
- [jamstackthemes\.dev](https://jamstackthemes.dev/ssg/jekyll/){:target="_blank"}
- [jekyllthemes\.org](http://jekyllthemes.org/){:target="_blank"}
- [jekyllthemes\.io](https://jekyllthemes.io/){:target="_blank"}
- [jekyll\-themes\.com](https://jekyll-themes.com/){:target="_blank"}

The installation method generally uses [gem\-based themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#installing-a-theme){:target="_blank"}, but some repositories offer installation via Fork or even one-click installation. Each template may have different installation methods, so please refer to the template's usage instructions.

> Additionally, please note that since we are deploying to GitHub Pages, not all templates are compatible according to the official documentation.

### Chirpy Template

I will demonstrate using the template [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/){:target="_blank"}, which provides a very straightforward one-click installation method.

> Other templates rarely offer similar one-click installations. If you're unfamiliar with Jekyll or GitHub Pages, starting with this template is a good way to get acquainted. I may update this article later to discuss other template installation methods.

> You can also find templates on GitHub that can be directly Forked (e.g., [al\-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio){:target="_blank"}) for immediate use. If none of these options work, you will need to manually install the template and research how to set up GitHub Pages deployment. I’ve done some preliminary research on this but haven’t succeeded yet; I’ll return to this article to share any findings later.

#### Create a Git Repo from the Git Template

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*XRaln4SJiK-la32HhSYPug.png)

[https://github\.com/cotes2020/chirpy\-starter/generate](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter/generate){:target="_blank"}
- Repository name: `GithubAccount/OrganizationName.github.io` ( **Make sure to use this format** )
- Ensure you select "Public" for the repository.

Click "Create repository from template" to complete the repo creation.

#### Git Clone the Project

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*cQUPBm6tzyceXV-iwY5rzw.png)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zhgchgli0718/zhgchgli0718.github.io.git
```

Clone the repo you just created.

Run `bundle` to install dependencies:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*4ebE2NABGtRbKvc75e6aLA.png)

Run `bundle lock — add-platform x86_64-linux` to lock the version:

> ⚠️ Any adjustments to `_config.yml` require restarting the local site for the changes to take effect!

#### Preview the Website

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run `bundle exec jekyll s` to start the local site:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*f9xi6k6NCjesF0YtgjvogQ.png)

Copy the URL `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` and paste it into your browser to open it.

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*BSUbXFi082ZkHil2cWV2BQ.png)

**Local preview successful!**

Keep this Terminal open, and the local site will remain active. The Terminal will continuously update the site access logs, making it easier for us to debug.

We can open another new Terminal for subsequent operations.

### Jekyll Directory Structure

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*Rf8A-Y36J1oy6rwG1Crt8w.png)

Depending on the template, there may be different folders and configuration files. The article directory is:
- **\_posts/**: Articles will be placed in this directory.
Article file naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-article-file-name.md`
- **assets/**: 
The resource directory for the website, where images for the site or **images within articles** should be placed.

Other directories like \_includes, \_layouts, \_sites, \_tabs, etc., allow for advanced customization.

Jekyll uses [Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/){:target="_blank"} as its page template engine, where page templates are composed in a manner similar to inheritance:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*g9n4qBgEWb_ErOOwqrUC6Q.jpeg)

Users can freely customize their pages. The engine first checks if the user has created a corresponding customization file for the page. If not, it checks if a template exists. If neither is available, it will display the original Jekyll style.

This means we can easily customize any page by simply creating a file with the same name in the corresponding directory!

### Creating/Editing Articles
- We can start by deleting all example article files in the `_posts/` directory.

Using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} (free) or [Typora](https://typora.io/){:target="_blank"} (paid), we can create Markdown files. Here, we will use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} as an example:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*5xgNYYYQXHylU6GV_akGfQ.png)

- Article file naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-article-file-name.md`
- It is recommended to use English for the file name (for SEO optimization), as this name will be part of the URL path.

**Article Top Meta**:
```markdown
---
layout: post
title:  "Hello"
description: ZhgChgLi's first article
date:   2022-07-16 10:03:36 +0800
categories: Jekyll Life
author: ZhgChgLi
tags: [ios]
---
```
- layout: post
- title: Article title (og:title)
- description: Article description (og:description)
- date: Article publication date (cannot be in the future)
- author: Author (meta:author)
- tags: Tags (can be multiple)
- categories: Category (single, use spaces to separate parent and child categories, e.g., `Jekyll Life` -> Jekyll directory under Life directory)

**Article Content**:

### Downloading Articles from Medium and Converting to Markdown for Jekyll

With a basic understanding of Jekyll, we can move forward by using the [ZMediumToMarkdown](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"} tool to download existing articles from Medium and convert them into Markdown format to place in our Blog folder.

[![](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/493527574/9b5b7025-cc95-4e81-84a9-b38706093c27)](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"}

After navigating to the blog directory, run the following command to download all articles from the specified Medium user:
```bash
ZMediumToMarkdown -j your Medium account
```

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*cOFDZUWbpslzO975nT1QAg.png)

Wait for all articles to finish downloading...

> If you encounter any download issues or unexpected errors, feel free to [contact me](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"}. This downloader is developed by me (see [development insights](../ddd88a84e177/)), and I can help you resolve issues quickly.

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*5UfA22gZLQBXSc5jXgCmlg.png)

Once the download is complete, you can preview the results on your local site.

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*1Qg8jGrPc5tDRI4tZ1B5dg.png)

**Done!! We have seamlessly imported Medium articles into Jekyll!**

You can check if the articles are formatted correctly and if any images are missing. If you find any issues, please [report them to me](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"} for assistance.

### Uploading Content to the Repo

Once the local preview looks good, we need to push the content to the GitHub Repo.

Use the following Git commands in order:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "update post"
git push
```

After pushing, return to GitHub to see the Actions running the CD:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*UV9_80VRsMvmLtYJVpTrog.png)

Wait about 5 minutes...

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*ZvVHhaIcZjUZgvtUkFte5w.png)

Deployment complete!

#### Initial Deployment Settings

After the first deployment, you need to change the following settings:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*enRTr0wapljkC7pi-qJ91g.png)

Otherwise, visiting the website will only show:
```
--- layout: home # Index page ---
```

After clicking "Save," it won't take effect immediately; you need to return to the "Actions" page and wait for the deployment to complete again.

Once redeployed, you will successfully access the website:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*YvIOSgW9sQ14UIWUMFTJww.png)

Demo -> [zhgchg.li](https://zhgchg.li/){:target="_blank"}

Now you have your own free Jekyll personal blog!

#### About Deployment

Every time you push content to the Repo, it will trigger a redeployment. You need to wait for the deployment to succeed for the changes to take effect.

### Binding a Custom Domain

If you don't like the [zhgchgli0718.github.io](https://zhgchgli0718.github.io/){:target="_blank"} GitHub URL, you can purchase a domain you like from [Namecheap](https://namecheap.pxf.io/P0jdZQ){:target="_blank"} or register a free .tk domain using [Dot.tk](http://dot.tk/en/index.html?lang=en){:target="_blank"}.

After purchasing the domain, go to the domain management panel:

Add the following four Type A Record entries:
```
A Record @ 185.199.108.153
A Record @ 185.199.109.153
A Record @ 185.199.110.153
A Record @ 185.199.111.153
```

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*29e7AxJnZpnrNbniRMtkKg.png)

After adding the settings in the domain management panel, return to the GitHub Repo Settings:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*Q-FB7x5j9t-Q6QKW6LFTow.png)

Enter your domain in the Custom domain field and click "Save."

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*ZlXEv-g-W58sbe7lfnT1kQ.png)

Once the DNS is propagated, you can replace the original github.io URL with zhgchg.li.

> ⚠️ DNS settings may take at least 5 minutes to 72 hours to take effect. If verification fails, please try again later.

### Cloud-Based, Fully Automated Medium Sync Mechanism

Do you find it cumbersome to manually run [ZMediumToMarkdown](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"} on your computer every time there’s a new article and then push it to the project?

[ZMediumToMarkdown](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"} also offers a convenient [GitHub Action feature](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/zmediumtomarkdown-automatic-bot){:target="_blank"} that allows you to automate the synchronization of Medium articles to your website without needing to use your computer.

**Go to the Repo's Actions settings:**

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*DioRzBToaaSmYzccOrCwBw.png)

Click "New workflow"

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*jGkqhcqk-H7_cCWWZwVNzg.png)

Click "set up a workflow yourself"

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*vA7YX2umOfis2pSUxlR60Q.png)

- Change the file name to: `ZMediumToMarkdown.yml`
- The file content should be as follows:

```yaml
name: ZMediumToMarkdown
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: "10 1 15 * *" # At 01:10 on day-of-month 15.

Once completed, it will also trigger a redeployment, and after redeployment, the latest content will appear on the website. 🚀
