### [Travelogue] 2023 8-Day Free Trip to Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe

2023/05 Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe 8-Day Independent Travel Record and Food, Accommodation, Transportation, and Entry Information

#### Preface

I have only been to two Southeast Asian countries before: Sabah, Malaysia in 2019, and Bangkok, Thailand in 2018, both on group tours.

![I really like the clear blue skies and the uninhibited freedom in Southeast Asia](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*TPZ1M70G3KF3662-TH_ehA.jpeg)

I really love the clear blue skies and the carefree indulgence in Southeast Asia.

#### ENFP

As an enthusiastic and impulsive ENFP who acts on a whim, this trip was planned and set off within just two weeks. It started because my friend [Huang Xinping](https://medium.com/u/eac9088ed800){:target="_blank"} happened to have a career gap and is also an INFJ, a complementary personality to ENFP. I provided the passionate direction, and he handled the detailed planning. With our collaboration, we spontaneously decided to go.

### Preparation Before Departure

#### Joy

Because everything was casual, I only planned to visit Universal Studios Osaka, so I first bought tickets online; since it was too close to the date, everything was sold out except for regular admission tickets.

> Popular spots and theme parks in Japan really require advance purchase Orz. This time I missed out on baseball tickets; none were available at the venue, so I could only enjoy the park for a day.

Other attractions, temples, and trips are flexible.

You must exchange Japanese yen, as most temple entrance fees, souvenirs, amulets, and some trains (if you want to buy reserved seats) only accept cash.

This time I exchanged ¥50,000, and ended up with about ¥15,000 left.

#### Action

#### 🛫

With less than a month until departure, there’s not much to choose from. I went straight to [SkyScanner](https://www.skyscanner.com.tw){:target="_blank"} and found a flight that suits our laid-back pace:

Taoyuan &lt;-&gt; Kansai

- 5/22 `EVA Air BR 130` 13:35 TPE -> KIX 17:15 (actually delayed over 1 hour, arrived in Japan at 18:40)

- 5/29 `EVA Air BR 177` 11:10 KIX -> TPE 13:05

Round trip: `$14,915`

It seems that since last year, baggage check-in has changed to a piece and weight system: one piece per person, up to 23kg; extra items require additional fees.

> **Since purchasing airline tickets with a credit card includes travel insurance, it is recommended to buy tickets separately for each person and verify your bank credit card's insurance coverage, as some debit cards may not offer this benefit.**

You can also purchase travel insurance yourself (medical, inconvenience, loss, accidents, etc.). This time, 8 days cost about $1,500.

#### The Flight Tracker

I recommend installing [The Flight Tracker App](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/the-flight-tracker/id533365777){:target="_blank"}. Enter your flight details to track real-time flight information, including terminal, gate, and baggage claim details. (It also notifies you of changes, but on-site information should be prioritized.)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*badttSlh9cZNW30TlZlxFw.png)

![You can enable iOS Live Activity feature to track in real-time a few hours before the flight takes off](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Sx7YU5RDmVm028kcwZzNNQ.png)

You can enable the iOS Live Activity feature to track in real-time a few hours before the flight takes off.

#### 📲

I bought an 8-day unlimited data SIM card directly from KKDAY online for about $700; there is also an E-SIM version, but I still prefer swapping a physical SIM card for peace of mind.

- You can keep the SIM card (including the SIM ejector tool) with you and switch to the Japanese SIM card on the plane after it lands safely.

- Remember to enable roaming after the change, then restart your device.

- All-you-can-eat plans in Japan may not truly be unlimited; speeds may be reduced after a certain data limit. Please check with the provider for details. It is recommended to use Wi-Fi when sending or watching videos.

#### 🚈

Trains, subways, and buses all accept the Sucia EasyCard; some convenience stores and shops also accept it.

iPhone can directly go to "Wallet & Apple Pay" -> "Add Card" -> "Transit Card" -> "Japan" -> "Suica" -> directly activate the virtual Suica.

> However, to top up, you must use a MasterCard credit card. I failed to top up with a Visa card; **it is strongly recommended to complete the top-up in Taiwan first. Otherwise, if you find out in Japan that you cannot top up and do not receive the SMS verification code, it means you cannot use it at all.**

If you cannot use an iPhone Suica or Android; currently, physical Suica cards in Japan are out of stock. You can only buy the 28-day Welcome Suica limited-time card, which can be loaded and used, **but it will expire after the period and cannot be refunded**.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*gae6qhvGRJPz4mU5of-Ciw.png)

Apple Watch also supports Suica (not shared with iPhone). Remember to set it up and top up in Taiwan first.

iPhone transit cards do not require you to open the Apple Pay screen when tapping; simply take out the device, and it will automatically wake up for sensing.

#### Accommodation

Mainly use [Agoda](https://www.agoda.com){:target="_blank"} to find places close to tram or subway stations.

#### Kyoto 2 Nights: [Toyoko INN Kyoto Shijo Omiya](https://www.toyoko-inn.com/index.php/china/search/detail/00027/){:target="_blank"}

Toyoko INN is a chain hotel recommended by friends familiar with Northeast Asia. It offers great value for money and is reliable, plus it includes a Japanese-style breakfast (rice balls or curry rice).

Because the booking was made too late, only four rooms are available at Toyoko INN Omiya; it is farther from Kyoto Station, about 3 kilometers away:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*YHktsP2WIZdgMmR6mbCeFg.png)

`2 people total NT$3,844`

#### Osaka 4 Nights: [APA Hotel Osaka Umeda (大阪梅田)](https://www.agoda.com/apa-hotel-osaka-umeda/hotel/osaka-jp.html?cid=1844104){:target="_blank"}

Also, because we booked too late, there were few options; we chose another APA chain hotel closer to the station but more expensive. It does not include breakfast but has facilities like a swimming pool and public bathhouse.

About a 15-minute walk from Osaka Umeda Station:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*CReJWCYGJK4-q6cUpWjM1g.png)

`2 people total NT$21,459`

#### Pre-Arrival Application (Express Clearance)

No special visa application or COVID vaccine/test proof is required; once your flight and hotel bookings are done, you can fill in your entry information on Visit Japan. After landing and connecting your phone to the internet, you can enter directly. Without prior application, you can only fill out a paper form on the spot.

Steps upon entry:

- Connect to the internet and log in to the website

- Scroll down to the bottom of the webpage to find "Show QR Code"

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*DvxjZ8Ound43OxwuSUHenw.png)

#### [2024–11–25 Update] The "Immigration Inspection" and "Customs Declaration" QR Codes have been merged into a single "Immigration and Customs Declaration QR Code." There is no distinction between blue and yellow codes. The following content is for record only and can be ignored.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*GiET7RkLvkwTBhyHkwaS8A.png)

- Show your passport and QR code to the visa officer (yellow code)

- Step 2: After collecting your luggage and passing through customs, click on the "Customs Declaration QR Code" (blue code).

At the self-service customs inspection machine, scan your passport and this QR code. Once confirmed, you can complete the customs clearance and entry process.

### Day 1 Departure

#### A1 Taipei Main Station [Pre-flight Check-in](https://web.taoyuan-airport.com/ITCI/mobile/index.html){:target="_blank"}

Since the flight is at noon, we left slowly in the morning and arrived at Taoyuan Airport MRT A1 Taipei Main Station at 9 AM to complete online check-in:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*73iapWDHhWL47WKxQ-G3Qg.png)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*QWTmlFlUon0pCLR6MS8Adg.jpeg)

[**Online Check-in**](https://web.taoyuan-airport.com/ITCI/mobile/index.html){:target="_blank"} **= Complete check-in, baggage screening, and luggage drop-off at A1 Taipei Main Station (also available at A13 New Taipei Industrial Park); you can go straight to immigration at the airport without waiting in line at the counter.**

If you are coming from the MRT, remember not to go straight down the escalator into the Airport MRT. Check-in is located outside the Airport MRT.

**Limitations:**

- Only certain airlines are eligible. For details, please refer to the [official website](https://web.taoyuan-airport.com/ITCI/mobile/index.html){:target="_blank"}

- Check-in and baggage drop must be completed at least 3 hours before the flight departure on the same day.

**Service Hours:**

#### Traveling Light on the Airport MRT to Terminal 2

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*yydntoZ3uzC1-pIoKcEzIA.png)

Remember to first check the airport schedules on the [Taoyuan Metro official website](https://www.tymetro.com.tw/tymetro-new/tw/_pages/travel-guide/timetable.php){:target="_blank"} for **express train** times, which better control your actual arrival time at the airport; **be sure to take the express train**.

#### Waiting for the plane

Left too early + checked in online, still nearly 3 hours before departure after immigration.

![Airport with few people at noon](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*DYcsCXL8fErCA60ZjLrM2g.jpeg)

![There is actually Xingbo Coffee!](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*O8NDf79oSA4H5gcPn5ygLQ.png)

There's even Xingbo Coffee!

![Due to a delayed landing, the departure was also delayed by over an hour](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*sj6-szSL_3W0ZPeDnC-pYA.jpeg)

The delayed landing caused the departure to be delayed by over an hour as well.

I’m not sure if it’s because of the online check-in, but the ground staff announced our names while waiting at the gate to confirm our presence and boarding.

![Bye 🇹🇼](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*gOQ5Dcp9tuqVrENowSuSCw.jpeg)

Bye 🇹🇼

After landing and inserting the Japanese SIM card to connect to the internet, you can log in to [Vista Japan](https://www.vjw.digital.go.jp/main/#/vjwpco001){:target="_blank"} to complete immigration and customs procedures.

#### Heading to Kyoto

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*BOlV6ZOZ1wu1CcFuZGunKw.png)

After exiting Kansai Airport, we took the `JR Kansai Airport Limited Express HARUKA` directly to `Kyoto Station`. It took about 1.5 hours, with only a few stops along the way.

It is recommended to buy tickets at the ticket machine to guarantee a seat.

![The iconic Kyoto Tower seen right outside the station](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*3DP2os8MPHenEIZFVQ4nQg.jpeg)

Right outside the station, you can see the iconic Kyoto Tower.

Then take a taxi to the hotel (because of the luggage, we didn’t take the bus, although there is a bus available); plus the flight delay, we arrived at the hotel after 9 PM on the first day.

![[Toyoko INN Kyoto Shijo Omiya](https://www.toyoko-inn.com/index.php/china/search/detail/00027/){:target="_blank"}](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*iyI_iir-8y35RrTeMiVk2Q.png)

[Toyoko INN Kyoto Shijo Omiya](https://www.toyoko-inn.com/index.php/china/search/detail/00027/){:target="_blank"}

The hotel front desk has a lady who speaks Chinese. I asked her about the best way to get to tomorrow's itinerary—very kind and helpful!

[![Toyoko INN Kyoto Shijo Omiya](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1b07_hqdefault.jpg "Toyoko INN Kyoto Shijo Omiya")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-TCPJ1a4c8){:target="_blank"}

The room is cool, consisting of two single rooms mirrored perfectly, connected with a shared bathroom.

![[Hanamaru Kushikatsu Workshop Omiya Branch](https://goo.gl/maps/gPPVsxyS7T7ZXFpp9){:target="_blank"}](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*vVM39pBMcUF08ZwVmhEFHQ.jpeg)

[Hanamaru Kushikatsu Seisakusho Omiya Branch](https://goo.gl/maps/gPPVsxyS7T7ZXFpp9){:target="_blank"}

It was late, so after dropping off our things at the hotel, we went out nearby to find something to eat and chose a fried skewer shop to go in.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*XB_EgLEPjiPWcRF1Ktn1Yg.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*tBd64pSc8p58LVQMZSIwxg.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*zq67bnypeGpEz3ynSXudSQ.jpeg)

![Plum Tea Rice](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*RUAalr6Hx6Kl5MyKBpQR1g.jpeg)

Plum Tea over Rice

The cheapest skewer starts at 80 yen, fresh, tasty, and affordable! An unexpected delight and favorite. When I wanted to visit again the next day, the shop was closed QQ

After eating, it's customary to go to the convenience store LAWSON to buy a late-night snack and continue eating back at the hotel:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*-LbI46XU6lZ0Ue7NWXiq6g.jpeg)

Soy sauce fried noodles are so-so and taste quite greasy.

### Day 2 (Kiyomizu-dera, Kinkaku-ji, Kyoto Tower)

Get up early and go downstairs to pack breakfast to eat in the room:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*5QWczrQqnTk-aj8Qyt1Ziw.jpeg)

Curry rice feels a bit too heavy after eating, so I still prefer Western or Taiwanese-style breakfast.

#### Yasaka Shrine

After eating, take the bus to Yasaka Shrine:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*-iXEQYC4rtsUMhU2uByLlA.jpeg)

Walk all the way to Kiyomizu-dera Temple

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*-GQLPV-UL9G0m9_LDpBQxw.jpeg)

The streets of Kyoto are eerily clean, with even the concrete blocks by the roadside free from any dirt or grime.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*zR0AujFfcUqzOsKNBdUMsg.jpeg)

Walking from Yasaka Shrine to Kiyomizu Temple is about 1–2 kilometers, but just enjoy the street scenery along the way!

![Yasaka Pagoda](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*1R_RQc0Yvx_z-FFQpv_kPQ.jpeg)

Yasaka Pagoda

Stopped by a shop for iced matcha and brown sugar dumplings:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*N_EfRICMRdzdOgEBJmhmHg.jpeg)

There is also delicious sake ice cream:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*AcjpEeRkNcjtTluWqvPzbg.jpeg)

#### Kiyomizu-dera Temple

Arrival

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*bXj9AKFMhbPZY3coeN7G5Q.jpeg)

The sun is strong, and there are many people.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*RD2_6GNXqnry8w5PFGqs_Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*o9yDC_Tlktu1dxkXL6tjMQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*W3CXMMQEz1KsiCzBnAhsDA.jpeg)

![Otowa Waterfall](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*PVpYqaRMj-bT_uiX-8L7Mw.png)

Otowa Waterfall

Queue up to pray for academic success, love, and long-lasting health.

After finishing the visit, I walked back down to Yasaka Shrine, grabbed a quick rice bowl, and followed the trend by buying a cup of % coffee.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*X8zLHy7qQAGXDLcEYUw8pg.jpeg)

**In the afternoon, take the bus to "Kaohsiung".... (Just kidding, it's Kinkaku-ji)**

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*dpfIGuJWmJpg6HjhHNS0_g.jpeg)

After getting off, it takes about a 15-minute walk to reach Kinkaku-ji:

#### Kinkaku-ji

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*SNjSHhgouBBxuCC-sinp9g.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*l2YQe7RomWZR2ruZ18dBXg.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*GcsrNE8nqnDep6E6ZqgqvQ.jpeg)

The bus stop for the return trip was crowded with many people. Those who are willing to walk can, like us, go to the next intersection to catch another bus route to avoid the crowd and head to Kyoto Tower.

#### Kyoto Tower

Around 5:30 PM, arrive at Kyoto Tower Observation Deck:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*AN__sVqUBCJgvFY_ybee7A.jpeg)

You can birdwatch the vast, unreachable Kyoto from above, with a bar downstairs; we originally planned to go down to rest first and come back up at night to see the night view, but when we finished eating and wanted to go back up, we found out re-entry was not allowed and we had to buy a new ticket, so we gave up.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*H7yOZRfu1ly0jIXSG418zA.jpeg)

Add a photo of the Kyoto Tower night view taken outdoors. (The weather was really nice)

![Cute Items](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Y7IljE0fXrQX-YFkuF2qWw.jpeg)

Cute Accessories

Just go to the convenience store to buy some instant noodles for a late-night snack and eat them back at the hotel.

### Day 3 (Arashiyama, Osaka)

On the second day, we skipped the hotel breakfast. After a good sleep, we checked out, left our luggage at the hotel, and headed out to Arashiyama.

Eating McDonald's Breakfast (15 TWD Cheaper than in Taiwan)

![After eating, walk straight across to catch the bus to Arashiyama](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*PZbsWuuO5-Oeo8EICxidFw.jpeg)

After eating, go straight across to catch the bus to Arashiyama.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*R7hF2Yz8z0Qd7H7qm_0GnQ.jpeg)

Shijo-Omiya is the starting station, and you can take the train directly to the last stop, Arashiyama. It's very convenient and you will definitely get a seat.

#### Arashiyama

Arrival:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*ywvHbpWCmqgfB4lukfyDdQ.jpeg)

Then head towards the Arashiyama direction:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*-IBXMS6B6UvEuu5RvUfKqA.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*_opLaTgAFt5liqk1iRNAwg.jpeg)

You can experience a boat ride to enjoy the river view (similar to Xiao Bitan?).

**If you have good stamina, you can choose a short hike:**

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*vVMBkstwBLLm6_X_rihRaQ.jpeg)

We went hiking to see monkeys and enjoy the panoramic view. It takes about 30–45 minutes to go from the bottom to the top of the mountain, and it's not difficult.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*2OLWr19-WJtVEghsNYqfRw.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*_GBZMqsC9oQv3AqtR_KqRQ.jpeg)

![There really is a monkey](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*JxJFLvqV6MKv2eigxdz9tw.jpeg)

There really is a monkey

After descending the mountain and heading back, I ate tempura soba for lunch along the way:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*FdUuFkOpbeqlypLHHLf6sA.jpeg)

Clicked the wrong one; it shouldn't be the rice with holes, as it will turn into soba noodles + tempura rice with holes.

After eating, head in another direction to "Daihon-zan Tenryu-ji":

#### Tenryu-ji Temple

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*IU0xz_xGQf5A6mBDfs1IRQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*IwR3iwVNfd8t8pSdbvIKyQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*EH9aanPhX6jD5Ezft1kXGw.jpeg)

Exit from the back gate of Tenryu-ji Temple and go straight to the bamboo grove:

There are really many people, so you need to find a good angle for photos 🥵

Shooting from bottom to top is also very beautiful.

Return to Omiya Station to pick up your luggage at the hotel and prepare to head to Osaka:

![The hotel is right outside Hankyu Omiya Station](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*wRzZYp5OBKid9GBqn308nw.jpeg)

The hotel is right outside Hankyu Omiya Station

On the first day, I felt it was a bit inconvenient because it was far from Kyoto Station; but later I realized it was actually great. It is centrally located between Kinkaku-ji and Kiyomizu-dera, with a direct train to Arashiyama right outside. To go to Osaka, you can also just take the train directly from there (about an hour's ride).

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*lM5wSwMr4TJO0XZN1fAlqg.png)

Arriving in Osaka for the first time, it’s easy to get lost because there are many exits. Osaka and Umeda actually refer to the same area.

#### Arrival at APA Hotel

The hotel rooftop features a free outdoor swimming pool, there is a convenience store inside the hotel, and public hot spring baths are available for free.

After dropping off our luggage, we went out to find something to eat:

The playground has a polar bear that mocks itself!!

### Day 4 Osaka Castle, Tsuruhashi, Nintendo

According to Google Maps directions, take the train and then walk to Osaka Castle. The walking part from the station to the moat and then to the main castle takes about 30 minutes, which is quite a distance.

> ***The line at the ticket counter is very long. You can [buy tickets online](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/155057?cid=19365&ud1=76d66c2e34af){:target="_blank"} to skip the queue and enter directly.***

#### Osaka Castle

View from the summit overlooking Osaka:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*6R4txDuX0m72KK4iH4tMDQ.jpeg)

Each layer contains an introduction to the history of the Warring States period:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*_MzKCjC8Makb94z085fzEg.jpeg)

After leaving Osaka Castle, I took a long walk around the nearby area to explore and find something to eat.

Then head to suburban Tsuruhashi to find some small shops for shopping.

#### Tsuruhashi

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*iP-KsL30b5ALsJMcny9uYQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*ILqXij71VdF4mdNq-vqovQ.jpeg)

After walking around Tsuruhashi for a long time, this area seems to be a non-touristy zone with few visitors; there are many Korean-themed shops, more like a Korean town for Japanese people.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*AqWknhZOFjA2Z71PFfrvsQ.jpeg)

Just came to Xiaodian to buy Korean cultural products, but later found out they are also sold in Taiwan - _ -

#### Nintendo

After walking all around Osaka, my feet were about to give out; fortunately, on the way back to Osaka Umeda Station, I stopped by Nintendo for a visit.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*47Jyiy6GbtyMsgpulz5ang.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*xj413-aR0XpGTN0ewEA29g.jpeg)

Nintendo Osaka is located upstairs in the Daimaru Department Store right next to the station.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Abyl6hUb_Q7JKuQJ02Njiw.jpeg)

Go crazy and buy tons of Zelda merchandise:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*9jo2K8KLDpJYn99_sKyjng.jpeg)

Everything feels high-quality; the badge is metal and finely crafted.

### Day 5 Universal Studios

> [***KKday Universal Studios Japan \| Universal Express Pass***](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/18618?cid=19365&ud1=76d66c2e34af){:target="_blank"}

We didn’t buy Express Passes or Super Mario World tickets, nor did we wake up early to line up; we took a laid-back, casual approach and entered the park after 10 a.m.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*hnEaw3xDmUtJ8s9oWbOgLw.jpeg)

The park was very crowded. Upon entering, I quickly used the app to try my luck at winning a Super Mario World ticket. Fortunately, thanks to the expert [Huang Xinping](https://medium.com/u/eac9088ed800){:target="_blank"}, I won the 5 PM entry slot for Mario World.

First, take a stroll around the Harry Potter-themed area:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*26bNykqgbS5f1s3AQyPq4Q.png)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*EhwXuclmBE4vdFFcntw_wg.jpeg)

![Butterbeer](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*zGOIfNIMihJ9q6SS1NSTPw.jpeg)

Butterbeer

Queued up to buy Butterbeer (non-alcoholic, very sweet). I think if you really want to collect it, you should buy the most expensive glass one.

Next Stop: Jurassic Park:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*d6Q__KSmajuK0UZPnV_ZZQ.jpeg)

Waited about 45 minutes for the ride; sat in the front row.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*En62Hiyumf-rpBd1N0HVNw.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Xwd9qgtHOhU_u8VtbB_C9w.jpeg)

Similar to a volcano adventure, it ends with a drop 🥵 (I'm very afraid of the weightless feeling).

[![USJ Jussia Park](/assets/76d66c2e34af/3381_hqdefault.jpg "USJ Jussia Park")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT6HG_S1eK0){:target="_blank"}

But luckily I got to visit. Later, I saw in the news that this facility will undergo renovation starting in June and will be closed for a few years.

#### After playing until nearly noon, we started wandering around and looking for food

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*vnmxVIqJrfEnrXb8GHNhtA.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*EYtfOe9nHxQ3oU-AnOEd2w.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*LWdvXTdLr7dpvDZ9DJdJxQ.jpeg)

The scenery inside is very realistic; you would think you're in the 🇺🇸.

#### NO LIMIT! Parade! Parade

[![NO LIMIT! Parade featuring Pokémon & Mario Kart First Performance - Universal Studios Japan](/assets/76d66c2e34af/4619_hqdefault.jpg "NO LIMIT! Parade featuring Pokémon & Mario Kart First Performance - Universal Studios Japan")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6O7iCsHpvg){:target="_blank"}

![Yoshi!!](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*iNe18pEWD5-B0-_IGjIFdA.png)

Yoshi!!

The unexpected joy and fun in the beginning still lingers in my mind with that melody today!

There will be floats featuring characters like Mario, Pokémon, and Sesame Street, along with dancers leading the crowd. At each stop, they will pause to get everyone moving together! All staff, including those maintaining order, will join in the dancing, creating a strong sense of involvement!

#### Super Mario World

Wandering around, I headed to Super Mario World at around five o'clock.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*gBhAC7fmzC88fOJCEfwcsg.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*ktiwOfpvtskS_lyq7w4uTQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*2dRBvOGNsJqIEacTXerBUg.jpeg)

I have to praise this scene design; it completely brings the game world into reality, like stepping into a paradise!

Since it was close to closing time, I didn't buy the watch to play the interactive scenes and only queued for Yoshi's attraction.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Fu7eeY_5bPGKDPOFbnFUJQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*74dfil0rh_oFD9ARir9-kw.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Yv35pE__YYy5-9zz1GzUAg.jpeg)

Every detail is crafted with great precision!

#### Farewell

Before closing, I took some night shots of Universal. Many places that were usually crowded became much easier to photograph.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*ocpZz_rQfIkj7FuET1w3xg.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*pbZcIUZRL2Yu1c_bFNvSjQ.jpeg)

Especially in the Harry Potter themed area, the wand interaction scenes usually have long lines, but before closing time, there was no one. I saw a girl enjoying every interaction scene all by herself XD

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Zqz4M7W4SY8LcYyhpoBRUg.png)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*3gdoxcodfV0aj6zeNUVXrw.jpeg)

Finally, took a last shot of the Earth, goodbye Global.

Had dinner at an izakaya and bought Nissin instant noodles for a late-night snack (after trying many, this one still tastes the best).

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*2NGQ9V5hEPmNMO9uzk3shQ.jpeg)

### Day 6 Kobe, Dotonbori

Got up early and took the train to Kobe.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*MMX0boFOG6L5SbBrWWcS9g.jpeg)

First, visit the Kobe shopping street.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*rwKM6_Zww3PeGl2AW2q-dg.png)

Taste the famous Kobe beef croquette

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*RAeMaoiRVFmqK6HqZwP1Og.jpeg)

Walk from the shopping street all the way to Kobe Port

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*tHKgOArJAFTc7MyJ2ELfPQ.jpeg)

Just realized the Kobe Tower is under maintenance QQ

![Detailed completion time uncertain](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*5oUCxrlF0IfmbRj-jKnwnw.jpeg)

The exact completion time is uncertain.

On the way back, stroll through the streets of Kobe

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*BYf32j2Xz3yseNNI6yGzwA.png)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*4g_Tw4Vk2JgJhHUUdMf8LQ.jpeg)

Stopped by a café in Kobe to take a break:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*jH413eSBntykPmEbNxXZzQ.jpeg)

Strawberry chocolate milkshake smoothie, tasty but very sweet.

#### Dotonbori

From Kobe to the Dotonbori area

For dinner, we went to the famous [Osaka Shinsekai Kushikatsu Ittoku](https://www.to-kosan.com/){:target="_blank"}.

After eating, start the tourist itinerary: take photos at scenic spots and visit drugstores to shop.

Back in Taiwan [I realized I took the photo wrong only after checking IG](https://www.instagram.com/p/CrSgDNDvUYH/){:target="_blank"} XD. Entering from the side of the department store offers a better photo spot.

Return to the hotel to continue eating instant noodles and drinking sake as a late-night snack.

![No Taste Memory](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*2UhMnFMRaGlxo3SWuAzwgg.jpeg)

No memory of the taste

### Day 7 Koshien, Namba, Drugstores, Shopping Spree

Last day before returning to Taiwan, just a quick sightseeing trip.

#### Koshien, Check-in Failed

Early in the morning, I suddenly decided to go to Koshien to watch the Hanshin Tigers baseball game and took the subway to Koshien Station.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*jub3IRmKUp3J47biO6Plrg.jpeg)

Exit leads directly to Koshien Baseball Stadium.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*vgXRR6pO2HykF2XWkU-Buw.jpeg)

But we were turned away; unlike baseball games in Taiwan where seats are always available, Hanshin games are sold out through July. You have to buy tickets early, or else you'll end up just hanging around outside the stadium all day.

Finally, we grabbed a bite nearby, bought some Hanshin Tigers merchandise, had a coffee at Cote d'Azur, and then left.

![I always thought it was called "Coffee Place"](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*2py39zcMErSshqtbURXgbA.jpeg)

I always thought it was called "Coffee Place."

![Hanshin Tigers Sticker](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*PMA8DNhqXi4bCTItZInnpQ.png)

Hanshin Tigers Stickers

#### Namba

After leaving Koshien, head to Namba for shopping and strolling.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Hmlb6Zq_w6yDoY4gZUhXSQ.png)

Also, grab some takoyaki and crab legs from the street vendors.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*_C9tEPwHwVSOl4niFQnVQg.png)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*RmURVoIjSSS97T_HCWVufQ.png)

Might have gone to the wrong store, felt very ordinary.

Walked back to the Dotonbori area, then continued to the Don Quijote main store.

![The only store with a Ferris wheel](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*ZCvf4uNNeBgHO9l6gITqEA.jpeg)

The only store with a Ferris wheel

After sightseeing, return to Osaka in the evening and find an izakaya near your accommodation for the last dinner.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*79m0d5nrZ5eBJS3GTMfdSg.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*VWGKN_9NAENw4k_FyNjiLQ.png)

One last look at the night view of Osaka.

#### Day 8 Return Trip

The flight is at noon, so I checked out at 7 AM to head to Kansai Airport.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*S8ztBQbh8T4A03erJejgTg.jpeg)

Starting today, the weather in Osaka has changed, becoming cloudy and rainy, fitting the mood of farewell perfectly.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*wALoeYw7vetSaC5cz1U5tw.jpeg)

Finally, took a photo of the Osaka building view as a farewell.

> I originally planned to take the train to Kansai Airport, but I didn’t want to carry my luggage up and down. The day before, I specifically checked the bus routes (including times and stops). Early in the morning, I went to the bus station to see if there were many people. Fortunately, the line was short, so we bought bus tickets to Kansai Airport and comfortably took the bus directly there.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*D1vu7K69LugUXZA6tXieJg.png)

You can also enjoy the final view of Osaka along the way.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*EA3htzbhXBOoZ4PFhHc2WA.jpeg)

Just arrived at the airport and was shocked by the long queue at the check-in counter.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*YAeZK91NqBpCFDK9eFm5SA.jpeg)

Finally, we found the correct check-in counter. We completed the online check-in and can go straight to the baggage drop-off counter! This saved us nearly an hour.

> Actually, I want to tell the people in line that if you open the webpage and click to get your e-ticket, you can go check in your luggage and then proceed to exit.

After passing through immigration, Kansai Airport was under renovation, with few food options and shops available. In the end, I bought a pork cutlet curry toast from Shinsekai.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*H_edW4jnC7qqiEArQBXSDg.jpeg)

Waiting at the airport, heading back to Taiwan.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*VKaFk3yiIBi2bqcFSL5Gyw.jpeg)

Arrived safely in Taiwan in the afternoon, heading home to rest! 🇹🇼

### Loot

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*sbi4h728VMU194WAVz2fYQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*qgp-9OrzQtrZuNnXY1yEXw.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*QeatVpK3I4QxmRDignMTfg.jpeg)

Actually, I didn't buy much, just whatever caught my eye. After comparing, I found that the drugstores near Kyoto Station were the cheapest (about 100-300 yen cheaper than in Osaka), with Don Quijote being the most expensive.

[![Youtube](/assets/76d66c2e34af/7ed2_hqdefault.jpg "Youtube")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bnx85z78O2w){:target="_blank"}

Yodobashi's theme song is really catchy; after shopping in Kyoto, I was immediately hooked.

Japan's tax-free policy requires a minimum purchase of ¥5,000 with a passport to qualify for tax exemption. Items will be sealed in a plastic bag, which must only be opened after returning home (the above photo was taken at home). Opening the bag inside Japan could lead to tax charges if caught at the border, though inspections seem rare. For compliance, remember that liquids must be checked in; if the sealed bag contains liquids, the entire bag must be checked in.

For food, besides the famous snacks, I mostly look for century-old local shops. I can't guarantee they taste great, but I guarantee they're a hundred years old. The snacks everyone recommends are definitely delicious, but you have to queue up and they're not century-old XD.

In the end, it's still best to find good food!

### Epilogue

Fell in love with Japan on my first visit and started planning the next trip as soon as I got back.

> Actually, I went to Tokyo again from 6/7 to 6/11 😝 Travelogue part two coming soon

Overall, the transportation is convenient, the environment is quiet, and the climate is pleasant (visiting in May feels like autumn in Taiwan, with cool evenings). People respect personal boundaries and are polite; I really like it!

Given the current value of the Japanese yen and prices, consumption is actually cheaper than in Taiwan...

#### Accommodation and Transportation:

- Trains and buses have wider coverage and are more convenient than in Taiwan; during the entire trip, I only took a taxi to the hotel on the first day.

- Although transportation is convenient, Japan is large, and most of the time you need to be active on foot, walking nearly 20,000 steps daily.

- Standing on the left or right is not fixed; in Kyoto, stand on the left, but in Osaka, stand on the right.

- Buses wait for passengers to be seated before starting and wait for you to stand up and get off slowly; therefore, there is no need to move around before the stop. Japanese people also dislike this behavior.

- Hotel bathrooms are very clean and comfortable; even the smallest rooms have bathtubs.

- Toilets are almost all bidet-style. In department stores, there is even background water sound to prevent awkwardness.

![5/23–5/28 Step Count Peak](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*qmwiX0LqkOv-izZIFSqHeA.jpeg)

5/23–5/28 Step Count Peak

#### Culture:

- The cityscape is clean and highly uniform (e.g., all entrances look the same; there are no cases where some households have shoe cabinets while others do not—either all have them or none do).

- No one eats while walking; everyone finishes eating in front of the shop before leaving.

- Trash can only be taken back to the hotel, as there are very few trash bins on the street. Therefore, it's most convenient to return the trash to the store after eating at the entrance.

- The store only accepts its own trash.

- English is basically incomprehensible, so communication relies on simple phrases, gestures, or translation apps; however, drugstores and large shopping malls usually have Chinese-speaking staff.

- Buying tickets, receipts, giving change, and handing money should be done by directly placing or taking from the tray without touching the staff.

- Avoid physical contact and staying too close.

- Public transportation is generally very quiet, especially buses.

- **When taking photos or videos, avoid capturing people's faces. If uploading to social media, blur any faces.**

- When photographing temples, shoot at an angle, not straight on.

- Focus on detailed SOPs; also, it seems difficult to integrate into Japan.

- Japanese people generally dress formally or at least stylishly, and women are usually very well-groomed.

> Also, don't criticize others. At Universal Studios, we encountered a group from Taiwan (he had a 🇹🇼 sticker on his bag) who seemed to be on a company trip for a multi-level marketing company. They were loudly shouting slogans and filming, saying things like "Shout super awesome, sales going up." Because the place was crowded and they stood in the middle of the path, a group shouting slogans and repeatedly filming and shouting was really embarrassing.

#### Returning to Work and "Product"

My personal feeling is that if you want to enter the Japanese market, relying solely on advertising and marketing will be very difficult. At best, you might reach some people who want to try something new. Japan has a strong cultural unity, so you need to find a way to integrate into their lifestyle and habits to have a chance to win their hearts.

Another issue is the low fault tolerance, such as bugs or unexpected appearances of other languages; for us, one or two times might be acceptable or at least not frequent; for them, even one occurrence could cause a shutdown because this system is not rigorous enough or does not take them seriously.
