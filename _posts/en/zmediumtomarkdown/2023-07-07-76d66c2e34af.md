### \[Travel Journal\] 2023: 8-Day Free Trip to Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe

Record of the 8-day free trip to Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe in May 2023, including accommodation and transportation information.

#### Introduction

Previously, I had only visited two Southeast Asian countries, Malaysia 🇲🇾 Sabah in 2019 and Thailand 🇹🇭 Bangkok in 2018, both as part of group tours.

![I really love the clear blue skies and the unrestrained indulgence of Southeast Asia](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*TPZ1M70G3KF3662-TH_ehA.jpeg)

I really love the clear blue skies and the unrestrained indulgence of Southeast Asia.

#### ENFP

As an enthusiastic and impulsive ENFP, there was only a two-week gap between the proposal and departure for this trip; the reason being that my friend [Huang Xingping](https://medium.com/u/eac9088ed800){:target="_blank"} happened to have a career gap, and he is also an INFJ, which complements my ENFP personality. I provided the enthusiastic direction, and he provided the detailed planning, and together we spontaneously set off.

### Pre-Trip Preparation
#### Fun


Since everything is quite spontaneous, I only arranged to go to Universal Studios Osaka, so I bought tickets online first; however, due to the timing being too close, everything was sold out, and I could only purchase general admission tickets.

> Popular attractions and amusement parks in Japan really need to be booked in advance Orz. This time, I lost out due to baseball; there were no tickets available on-site, so I could only do a one-day tour of the venue.

Other attractions, temples, and the itinerary are flexible.

You must exchange yen; most temple tickets, souvenirs, amulets, and some train tickets (if you want to buy a reserved seat) can only be paid in cash.

This time I exchanged ¥50,000, and I ended up with about ¥15,000 left.
#### Travel
#### 🛫

With less than a month until departure, there wasn't much to choose from, so I went directly to [SkyScanner](https://www.skyscanner.com.tw){:target="_blank"} to find a flight that matched our spontaneous pace:

Taoyuan &lt;-> Kansai
- 5/22 `EVA Air BR 130` 13:35 TPE -> KIX 17:15 (actually delayed over an hour, arrived in Japan at 18:40)
- 5/29 `EVA Air BR 177` 11:10 KIX -> TPE 13:05

Round trip: `$14,915`

It seems that since last year, checked baggage has changed to be charged by piece + weight, with a limit of one piece per person & under 23kg; everything else incurs additional fees.

> **Since purchasing tickets with a credit card comes with travel insurance, it is recommended to buy tickets separately for individuals and check the insurance details of your bank's credit card, as some debit cards may not have it.**

Additionally, you can also purchase travel insurance (medical, inconvenience, loss, accident, etc.); this time, the insurance for 8 days was about $1,500.
#### The Flight Tracker

I recommend installing [The Flight Tracker App](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/the-flight-tracker/id533365777){:target="_blank"} to input flight information and track it in real-time, including terminal, gate, and baggage check-in information. (It will notify you of changes, but still rely on on-site information.)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*badttSlh9cZNW30TlZlxFw.png)

![You can enable the iOS Live Activity feature to track in real-time a few hours before the flight takes off](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Sx7YU5RDmVm028kcwZzNNQ.png)

You can enable the iOS Live Activity feature to track in real-time a few hours before the flight takes off.
#### 📲

For the internet, I directly bought an 8-day unlimited SIM card from KKDAY for about $700; there is also an E-SIM version, but I still prefer to swap physical SIM cards for peace of mind.
- You can keep the SIM card (including the SIM card pin) with you, and after a safe landing, you can switch to the Japanese SIM card on the plane.
- Remember to enable roaming in the settings after switching, then restart your phone.
- The unlimited plan in Japan may not truly be unlimited; exceeding a certain data limit will result in reduced speeds. For details, please inquire with the seller; it is recommended to connect to Wi-Fi if you need to send or watch videos.

#### 🚈

You can directly use the Suica card for trains, subways, or buses; it can also be used at some convenience stores and shops.

On iPhone, you can go to "Wallet & Apple Pay" -> "Add Card" -> "Transit Card" -> "Japan" -> "Suica" -> and directly activate the virtual Suica.

> However, you need to use a MasterCard credit card for recharging; I had failed to recharge using a Visa card. **It is recommended to set up and recharge in Taiwan beforehand; otherwise, if you find out you can't recharge in Japan and also don't receive the SMS verification code, it will be unusable.**

If you can't use the iPhone Suica or Android; currently, physical Suica cards are out of stock in Japan, and you can only buy the 28-day Welcome Suica limited-time card, which can be recharged and used, **but it will expire after the deadline and is non-refundable**.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*gae6qhvGRJPz4mU5of-Ciw.png)

Apple Watch also has Suica available (not interchangeable with iPhone), so remember to set it up and recharge it in Taiwan as well.

The iPhone transit card does not require you to specifically bring up the Apple Pay screen when sensing; just take out the device, and it will sense automatically (it will wake up to sense).
#### Accommodation

I mainly used [Agoda](https://www.agoda.com){:target="_blank"} to find places close to train and subway stations.
#### Kyoto 2 Nights: [Toyoko Inn Kyoto Shijo Omiya](https://www.toyoko-inn.com/index.php/china/search/detail/00027/){:target="_blank"}

Toyoko Inn is a chain hotel system recommended by friends from Northeast Asia, known for its high cost-performance ratio and reliability, plus it includes a Japanese breakfast (rice balls or curry rice).

Since I booked too late, only the Toyoko Inn at Shijo Omiya had available rooms; it is relatively far from Kyoto Station, about 3 kilometers:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*YHktsP2WIZdgMmR6mbCeFg.png)


`2 people total NT$3,844`
#### Osaka 4 Nights: [APA Hotel Osaka Umeda \(大阪梅田\)](https://www.agoda.com/apa-hotel-osaka-umeda/hotel/osaka-jp.html?cid=1844104){:target="_blank"}

Due to booking at a late time, there were not many options available; we chose another chain hotel, APA, which is closer to the station but at a higher price. No breakfast is included, but there are facilities such as a swimming pool and public bath.

It takes about a 15-minute walk from Osaka Umeda Station:


![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*CReJWCYGJK4-q6cUpWjM1g.png)


`2 people total NT$21,459`
#### Pre-Entry Application \(Fast Track\)

No special visa application is required, and no COVID vaccine or nucleic acid test proof is needed; once the flight and accommodation are booked, you can go to Visit Japan to fill in your entry information. When you land and connect to the internet, you can enter directly. If you haven't applied in advance, you will have to fill out a paper form on-site.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Vkl74skGLh0XxyIdJRNRSA.png)

- Scroll to the bottom of the webpage to find "Display QR Code"



![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*DvxjZ8Ound43OxwuSUHenw.png)

#### \[2024–11–25 Update\] "Immigration Inspection" and "Customs Declaration" QR Codes have been merged into the same "QR Code for Immigration Inspection and Customs Declaration," with no distinction between blue and yellow codes. The following content is for record-keeping purposes and can be ignored.


![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*GiET7RkLvkwTBhyHkwaS8A.png)

- Present your passport and QR code to the immigration officer \(yellow code\)



![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*U1XWkLSM-cxgaZaxNntk6A.png)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*MSXAq5-Y-bpq-NtLTdonlg.png)

At the self-service customs inspection machine, scan your passport and this QR code, and once confirmed, you can complete your exit and entry process.
### Day 1 Departure

Log in to the airline's website or email to check in online, and you can directly add your boarding pass to Apple Pay, fully digitalized.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*S-sLxOCtlTXZjOUAeezBsQ.jpeg)

#### A1 Taipei Station [Pre-check-in](https://web.taoyuan-airport.com/ITCI/mobile/index.html){:target="_blank"}

Since it’s a noon flight, we took our time in the morning and arrived at the A1 Taipei Station at 9 AM for pre-check-in:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*73iapWDHhWL47WKxQ-G3Qg.png)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*QWTmlFlUon0pCLR6MS8Adg.jpeg)

[**Pre-check-in**](https://web.taoyuan-airport.com/ITCI/mobile/index.html){:target="_blank"} **= You can complete check-in + luggage security check + luggage drop-off at A1 Taipei Station (A13 New Taipei Industrial Park also has this service); you can go directly to the departure area at the airport without crowding at the counter.**

If you are coming from the MRT, remember not to go directly down the escalator to the airport MRT; the pre-check-in is outside the airport MRT.

**Restrictions:**
- Only certain airlines are eligible; please refer to the [official website](https://web.taoyuan-airport.com/ITCI/mobile/index.html){:target="_blank"} for details.
- You must complete check-in and luggage drop-off at least 3 hours before the flight departure.

**Service Hours:**
- A1 Taipei Station 06:00~21:30
- A3 New Taipei Industrial Park Station 09:00~16:00

#### Traveling to the airport with empty hands -> Terminal 2

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*yydntoZ3uzC1-pIoKcEzIA.png)

Remember to check the [Airport MRT official website](https://www.tymetro.com.tw/tymetro-new/tw/_pages/travel-guide/timetable.php){:target="_blank"} for **direct train** schedules to better manage your actual time to the airport; **make sure to take the direct train**.
#### Waiting for the Flight

Leaving too early + pre-check-in means we have nearly 3 hours after exiting before the flight takes off.

![The flight was delayed by more than an hour due to a late landing](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*sj6-szSL_3W0ZPeDnC-pYA.jpeg)

The flight was delayed by more than an hour due to a late landing.

I don't know if it was because of the pre-check-in, but during the waiting time, the ground staff made announcements calling our names to confirm our presence for boarding.

![Bye 🇹🇼](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*gOQ5Dcp9tuqVrENowSuSCw.jpeg)

Bye 🇹🇼

After the plane landed, I switched to a Japanese SIM card to connect to the internet and then logged into [Vista Japan](https://www.vjw.digital.go.jp/main/#/vjwpco001){:target="_blank"} to complete the entry and exit procedures.
#### Heading to Kyoto

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*BOlV6ZOZ1wu1CcFuZGunKw.png)

After exiting Kansai Airport, we took the `JR Kansai Airport Express HARUKA` directly to `Kyoto Station`, which takes about an hour and a half, stopping at only a few stations along the way.

It is recommended to buy tickets from the ticket machine to ensure you have a seat.

![As soon as you exit the station, you see the iconic Kyoto Tower](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*3DP2os8MPHenEIZFVQ4nQg.jpeg)

As soon as you exit the station, you see the iconic Kyoto Tower.

Then we took a taxi to the hotel (since we had luggage, we didn't take the bus, although there is a bus that goes there); due to the flight delay, we arrived at the hotel after 9 PM on the first day.

![[Toyoko Inn Kyoto Shijo Omiya](https://www.toyoko-inn.com/index.php/china/search/detail/00027/){:target="_blank"}](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*iyI_iir-8y35RrTeMiVk2Q.png)


[Toyoko Inn Kyoto Shijo Omiya](https://www.toyoko-inn.com/index.php/china/search/detail/00027/){:target="_blank"}

At the hotel front desk, there was a sister who could speak Chinese. I asked her how to get to tomorrow's itinerary smoothly—she was very kind and helpful!

[![Toyoko Inn Kyoto Shijo Omiya](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1b07_hqdefault.jpg "Toyoko Inn Kyoto Shijo Omiya")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-TCPJ1a4c8){:target="_blank"}

The room was cool; it was two single rooms with a full-length mirror that shared a bathroom.

![[Hanamaru Kushikatsu Omiya](https://goo.gl/maps/gPPVsxyS7T7ZXFpp9){:target="_blank"}](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*vVM39pBMcUF08ZwVmhEFHQ.jpeg)

[Hanamaru Kushikatsu Omiya](https://goo.gl/maps/gPPVsxyS7T7ZXFpp9){:target="_blank"}

It was quite late, and after putting our things away at the hotel, we went out to find something to eat nearby. We chose a fried skewer shop to go in.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*XB_EgLEPjiPWcRF1Ktn1Yg.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*tBd64pSc8p58LVQMZSIwxg.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*zq67bnypeGpEz3ynSXudSQ.jpeg)

![Plum Tea Rice](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*RUAalr6Hx6Kl5MyKBpQR1g.jpeg)

Plum Tea Rice

The cheapest skewer starts at 80 yen, fresh, delicious, and inexpensive! It was an unexpected surprise and delight, but when we wanted to visit again the next day, the shop was closed QQ.

After eating, we inevitably went to the convenience store LAWSON to buy a late-night snack to continue eating back at the hotel:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*-LbI46XU6lZ0Ue7NWXiq6g.jpeg)

The soy sauce fried noodles were mediocre and quite greasy.

### Day 2 (Kiyomizu Temple, Kinkaku-ji, Kyoto Tower)

Woke up early and went downstairs to pack breakfast to eat in the room:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*5QWczrQqnTk-aj8Qyt1Ziw.jpeg)

Curry rice; it felt a bit too heavy afterward. I'm still used to Western or Taiwanese breakfasts.

#### Yasaka Shrine

After a full meal, we took the bus to Yasaka Shrine:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*-iXEQYC4rtsUMhU2uByLlA.jpeg)

We walked all the way to Kiyomizu Temple.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*-GQLPV-UL9G0m9_LDpBQxw.jpeg)

The streets of Kyoto are frighteningly clean; even the roadside concrete blocks don't show any dirt or grime.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*zR0AujFfcUqzOsKNBdUMsg.jpeg)

Walking from Yasaka Shrine to Kiyomizu Temple takes about 1–2 kilometers, but just enjoy the street scenery!

![Yasaka Pagoda](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*1R_RQc0Yvx_z-FFQpv_kPQ.jpeg)

Yasaka Pagoda

On the way, we found a shop to drink iced matcha and eat brown sugar dumplings:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*N_EfRICMRdzdOgEBJmhmHg.jpeg)

And also had delicious sake ice cream:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*AcjpEeRkNcjtTluWqvPzbg.jpeg)

#### Kiyomizu Temple

Arrived

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*bXj9AKFMhbPZY3coeN7G5Q.jpeg)

The sun was very bright, and there were many people.

![Otowa Waterfall](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*PVpYqaRMj-bT_uiX-8L7Mw.png)

Otowa Waterfall

We queued to make wishes for academic success, love, and health.

After the visit, we walked back down to Yasaka Shrine, casually eating a rice bowl and buying a cup of % coffee along the way.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*X8zLHy7qQAGXDLcEYUw8pg.jpeg)

**In the afternoon, we took the bus to "Kaohsiung"... (Just kidding, it's Kinkaku-ji)**

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*dpfIGuJWmJpg6HjhHNS0_g.jpeg)

After getting off the bus, it takes about a 15-minute walk to reach Kinkaku-ji:
#### Kinkaku-ji

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*GcsrNE8nqnDep6E6ZqgqvQ.jpeg)

The bus stop on the return trip was crowded with many people. Friends who are more active can walk to the next intersection to catch another bus route to avoid the crowd and head to Kyoto Tower.
#### Kyoto Tower

Arriving at the Kyoto Tower observation deck around 5:30 PM:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*AN__sVqUBCJgvFY_ybee7A.jpeg)

You can enjoy a panoramic view of Kyoto, and there’s a bar downstairs. We initially thought about going down to rest and coming back up to see the night view, but when we were ready to go back up after eating, we found out that re-entry was not allowed, and we had to buy tickets again, so we gave up.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*H7yOZRfu1ly0jIXSG418zA.jpeg)

Here’s a night view of Kyoto Tower taken from outside after we left. (The weather was really nice)

![Cute little items](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Y7IljE0fXrQX-YFkuF2qWw.jpeg)

Cute little items

We also went to a convenience store to buy some instant noodles for a late-night snack back at the hotel.
### Day 3 (Arashiyama, Osaka)

On the second day, we skipped the hotel breakfast, got up early after a good sleep, checked out, and stored our luggage before heading to Arashiyama.

After eating, we walked directly across the street to catch a bus to Arashiyama.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*R7hF2Yz8z0Qd7H7qm_0GnQ.jpeg)

Shijo Omiya is the starting station, and you can take the bus directly to the last stop, Arashiyama, which is very convenient and always has seats available.
#### Arashiyama

Arrival:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*ywvHbpWCmqgfB4lukfyDdQ.jpeg)

Then we headed towards Arashiyama:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*_opLaTgAFt5liqk1iRNAwg.jpeg)

You can experience a boat ride to enjoy the river view (similar to Xiaobi Lake?).

**If you have good stamina, you can choose a small hike up the mountain:**

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*vVMBkstwBLLm6_X_rihRaQ.jpeg)

We ran up the mountain to see monkeys and enjoy the panoramic view. It takes about 30–45 minutes to walk from the bottom to the top, and it’s not difficult.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*_GBZMqsC9oQv3AqtR_KqRQ.jpeg)

![There are really monkeys](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*JxJFLvqV6MKv2eigxdz9tw.jpeg)

There are really monkeys.

After coming down the mountain, we walked back and had lunch, tempura soba:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*FdUuFkOpbeqlypLHHLf6sA.jpeg)

I ordered incorrectly; I shouldn’t have ordered the tempura rice bowl, which turned out to be soba noodles + tempura rice bowl.

After eating, we headed in another direction towards "Daibutsusan Tenryuji":

After exiting the back gate of Tenryuji, we went directly to the bamboo grove:

There were really a lot of people, and it was hard to find a good angle for photos 🥵

Taking photos from below is also beautiful.

Returning to Shijo Omiya to pick up luggage and prepare to head to Osaka:


![The hotel is right outside Hankyu Omiya Station](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*wRzZYp5OBKid9GBqn308nw.jpeg)

The hotel is right outside Hankyu Omiya Station

When I first arrived here, I thought it was a bit inconvenient because it was far from Kyoto Station; but later I realized it was actually great; right in the center of Kinkaku-ji and Kiyomizu-dera, there’s a direct train to Arashiyama, and going to Osaka is also straightforward (it takes about an hour).


![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*lM5wSwMr4TJO0XZN1fAlqg.png)


Upon arriving in Osaka, I found it easy to get lost, as there are many exits; Osaka and Umeda are actually the same location.
#### Arriving at APA Hotel

The hotel has a free rooftop pool, a convenience store inside, and a free public bath.

After dropping off my luggage, I went out to find something to eat:

### Day 4 Osaka Castle, Tsuruhashi, Nintendo

Following Google Maps, I took the train and then walked to Osaka Castle. The walking part took about 30 minutes from the station to the moat and then to the main castle, which is a bit of a distance.


> **_The line at the ticket counter is very long; you can buy tickets [online](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/155057?cid=19365&ud1=76d66c2e34af){:target="_blank"} to skip the line and enter directly._**

Climbing to the top for a panoramic view of Osaka:


![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*6R4txDuX0m72KK4iH4tMDQ.jpeg)


Each floor has an introduction to the history of the Sengoku period:


![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*_MzKCjC8Makb94z085fzEg.jpeg)


After leaving Osaka Castle, I wandered around the area looking for food.

Then I headed to the suburbs of Tsuruhashi to find some small shops to buy things.
#### Tsuruhashi

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*ILqXij71VdF4mdNq-vqovQ.jpeg)


I walked around Tsuruhashi, which seems to be a non-touristy area with very few visitors; there are quite a few Korean shops, resembling a Korean town for Japanese people.


![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*AqWknhZOFjA2Z71PFfrvsQ.jpeg)

```markdown
Just came to buy some Korean cultural items, and later found out they are also sold in Taiwan - _ - 
#### Nintendo

After walking a long way in Osaka, my feet were about to give out; fortunately, I turned back and stopped by Nintendo while heading back to Osaka Umeda Station.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*47Jyiy6GbtyMsgpulz5ang.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*xj413-aR0XpGTN0ewEA29g.jpeg)

Osaka's Nintendo is located right above the Daimaru department store next to the station.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Abyl6hUb_Q7JKuQJ02Njiw.jpeg)

I went a bit crazy buying Zelda merchandise:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*9jo2K8KLDpJYn99_sKyjng.jpeg)

Everything has a great quality; the badges are metal and very finely crafted.
### Day 5 Universal Studios

> [**_KKday Japan Universal Studios | Universal Express Pass_**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/18618?cid=19365&ud1=76d66c2e34af){:target="_blank"} 

I didn't buy the Express Pass for Super Mario World, nor did I wake up early to queue; we took a laid-back approach and entered the park around 10 AM.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*hnEaw3xDmUtJ8s9oWbOgLw.jpeg)

There were a lot of people entering the park, and as soon as we got in, we quickly checked the app for Super Mario World tickets; luckily, thanks to the amazing [Huang Hsin-Ping](https://medium.com/u/eac9088ed800){:target="_blank"}, we got a 5 PM entry qualification for Mario World.

First, we strolled around the Harry Potter themed area:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*26bNykqgbS5f1s3AQyPq4Q.png)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*EhwXuclmBE4vdFFcntw_wg.jpeg)

![Butterbeer](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*zGOIfNIMihJ9q6SS1NSTPw.jpeg)

Butterbeer

I queued to buy Butterbeer (non-alcoholic and very sweet) and thought that if I were to collect it, I should buy the most expensive glass.

Next stop: Jurassic Park:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*d6Q__KSmajuK0UZPnV_ZZQ.jpeg)

We queued for the ride, which took about 45 minutes; we sat in the front row.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*-Zi4CLnaYNTb6s4NFfOZag.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*En62Hiyumf-rpBd1N0HVNw.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Xwd9qgtHOhU_u8VtbB_C9w.jpeg)

It was similar to a volcanic adventure, and in the end, we plunged down 🥵 (I really dislike the feeling of weightlessness).

[![USJ Jussia Park](/assets/76d66c2e34af/3381_hqdefault.jpg "USJ Jussia Park")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT6HG_S1eK0){:target="_blank"}

But thankfully, we got to ride it; later I saw in the news that this attraction will be undergoing renovations starting in June and will likely be closed for a few years.
#### After finishing, we started wandering around and looking for food

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*vnmxVIqJrfEnrXb8GHNhtA.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*EYtfOe9nHxQ3oU-AnOEd2w.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*LWdvXTdLr7dpvDZ9DJdJxQ.jpeg)

The scenery inside is very realistic; if you didn't say anything, you'd think you were in 🇺🇸.
#### NO LIMIT! Parade!

[![NO LIMIT! Parade featuring Pokémon & Mario Kart First Performance - Universal Studios Japan](/assets/76d66c2e34af/4619_hqdefault.jpg "NO LIMIT! Parade featuring Pokémon & Mario Kart First Performance - Universal Studios Japan")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6O7iCsHpvg){:target="_blank"}

![Yoshi!!](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*iNe18pEWD5-B0-_IGjIFdA.png)

Yoshi!!

The initial unexpected joy was so interesting that the melody still lingers in my mind today!

There were floats (Mario, Pokémon, Sesame Street... characters) and dancers leading the movements. At each segment, they would stop and get everyone moving together! All the staff, including those maintaining order, would join in the dance, creating a strong sense of immersion!
#### Super Mario World

We swayed our way to Super Mario World around five o'clock.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*gBhAC7fmzC88fOJCEfwcsg.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*2dRBvOGNsJqIEacTXerBUg.jpeg)

I must admire the design of this scene; it completely brings the game world into reality, as if stepping into a paradise!!

Since it was close to closing time, I didn't buy a watch to play the interactive scenes and only queued for Yoshi's attraction.

Every detail is crafted with great precision!
#### Farewell

Before closing, I took some night shots of Universal, and many places that were originally crowded became great for photography.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*ocpZz_rQfIkj7FuET1w3xg.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*pbZcIUZRL2Yu1c_bFNvSjQ.jpeg)

Especially in the Harry Potter themed area, where the interactive wand scenes usually had long lines, there was no one before closing time. I saw a sister enjoying every interactive scene by herself XD

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Zqz4M7W4SY8LcYyhpoBRUg.png)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*3gdoxcodfV0aj6zeNUVXrw.jpeg)

Finally, I took a picture of the globe. Goodbye, Universal.

For dinner, I had izakaya and bought Nissin instant noodles to enjoy as a late-night snack (after trying various options, this one is still the best).

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*2NGQ9V5hEPmNMO9uzk3shQ.jpeg)

### Day 6 Kobe, Dotonbori

I woke up early and took the train to Kobe.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*MMX0boFOG6L5SbBrWWcS9g.jpeg)

First, I strolled through the Kobe shopping street.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*rwKM6_Zww3PeGl2AW2q-dg.png)

Tried the famous Kobe beef croquette.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*RAeMaoiRVFmqK6HqZwP1Og.jpeg)

Walked from the shopping street to Kobe Harbor.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*eTgGzkj137X3SBpNt9e06A.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*tHKgOArJAFTc7MyJ2ELfPQ.jpeg)

Only to find out that the Kobe Tower is under maintenance QQ.

![Completion time is uncertain](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*5oUCxrlF0IfmbRj-jKnwnw.jpeg)

Completion time is uncertain.

On the way back, I strolled through the streets of Kobe.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*BYf32j2Xz3yseNNI6yGzwA.png)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*4g_Tw4Vk2JgJhHUUdMf8LQ.jpeg)

I found a café in Kobe to take a break:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*jH413eSBntykPmEbNxXZzQ.jpeg)

Strawberry chocolate milkshake, delicious but very sweet.
#### Dotonbori

From Kobe, I headed to Dotonbori.

For dinner, I went to the famous [Osaka Shinsekai Kushi Katsu Ittoku](https://www.to-kosan.com/){:target="_blank"}.
```

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*b7LkMARjX_7jiEj5fArxgQ.jpeg)

After eating, we started our sightseeing itinerary, taking photos at attractions and visiting drugstores to shop.

Glico

When I returned to Taiwan, I realized I took the wrong photo after checking [IG](https://www.instagram.com/p/CrSgDNDvUYH/){:target="_blank"} XD. There was a better viewpoint from the department store next door.

Back at the hotel, I continued to eat instant noodles and drink sake as a late-night snack.

### Day 7 Koshien, Namba, Drugstores, Shopping

It's the last day before returning to Taiwan, just a quick sightseeing itinerary.
#### Koshien, Failed Photo Op

Early in the morning, we spontaneously decided to go to Koshien to watch a Hanshin Tigers baseball game, taking the subway to Koshien Station.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*jub3IRmKUp3J47biO6Plrg.jpeg)

Upon exiting the station, we arrived at Koshien Stadium.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*vgXRR6pO2HykF2XWkU-Buw.jpeg)

However, we were turned away; unlike baseball games in Taiwan where there are always seats available, all tickets for Hanshin's games were sold out until July. You need to buy tickets in advance, or else you can only enjoy a day out outside the stadium.

In the end, we grabbed a bite nearby, bought some Hanshin Tigers merchandise, and then went to Doutor for a coffee before leaving.

![I Always Thought It Was Called "Coffee Place"](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*2py39zcMErSshqtbURXgbA.jpeg)

#### Namba

After leaving Koshien, we headed to Namba for shopping.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Hmlb6Zq_w6yDoY4gZUhXSQ.png)

We also stopped to eat some street takoyaki and crab legs.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*_C9tEPwHwVSOl4niFQnVQg.png)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*RmURVoIjSSS97T_HCWVufQ.png)

We might have gone to the wrong shop, as it felt quite average.

We walked back to Dotonbori and continued to the main store of Don Quijote.

![Only the Main Store Has a Ferris Wheel](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*ZCvf4uNNeBgHO9l6gITqEA.jpeg)

Only the Main Store Has a Ferris Wheel

After shopping, we returned to Osaka in the evening and found an izakaya near our accommodation to have our last dinner.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*79m0d5nrZ5eBJS3GTMfdSg.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*VWGKN_9NAENw4k_FyNjiLQ.png)

One last look at the Osaka night view.
#### Day 8 Return Trip

With a noon flight, we checked out at 7 AM to head to Kansai Airport.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*S8ztBQbh8T4A03erJejgTg.jpeg)

Today, the weather in Osaka changed, starting to rain, which matched the mood of farewell.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*wALoeYw7vetSaC5cz1U5tw.jpeg)

Finally, I took a photo of the Osaka skyline as a farewell.

> I originally planned to take the train to Kansai Airport, but it would mean dragging luggage up and down; the **day before, I specifically checked the bus route (including time and station locations)**. In the morning, I went to the bus station to see how crowded it was, and fortunately, there weren't many people in line, so we bought bus tickets to Kansai Airport and comfortably took the bus directly there.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*D1vu7K69LugUXZA6tXieJg.png)

沿途還能一路欣賞最後的大阪景觀

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*EA3htzbhXBOoZ4PFhHc2WA.jpeg)

剛到機場被櫃檯排隊人群嚇到，落落長。

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*YAeZK91NqBpCFDK9eFm5SA.jpeg)

最後發現排錯櫃檯，我們已經線上點一點完成報到，可以直接去排行李托運櫃檯！直接省了快一小時。

> 其實很想跟排隊的人說，你現在網頁打開點一點領好電子機票，就能去排托運然後出境了。

出境後，關西機場整修中，沒什麼吃的跟店家，最後又買了新世界的豬排咖哩吐司。

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*H_edW4jnC7qqiEArQBXSDg.jpeg)

候機，回台灣囉。

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*VKaFk3yiIBi2bqcFSL5Gyw.jpeg)

下午時分安全抵達台灣，回家休息！🇹🇼
### 戰利品

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*sbi4h728VMU194WAVz2fYQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*qgp-9OrzQtrZuNnXY1yEXw.jpeg)

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*QeatVpK3I4QxmRDignMTfg.jpeg)

其實沒買什麼東西，就是看到什麼買什麼；藥妝最後比較下來發現京都車站出來的藥妝店最便宜（大概比大阪便宜 $100\-$300 日圓）其中唐吉訶德最貴。

[![Youtube](/assets/76d66c2e34af/7ed2_hqdefault.jpg "Youtube")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bnx85z78O2w){:target="_blank"}

Yodobashi 的主題曲真的洗腦，在京都逛完直接被洗腦。

日本免稅規定是要滿 $5,000 日圓憑護照才能免稅，會用塑膠袋封起來，回國才能拆封（以上是回家拍的，在境內拆封如果出境查到可能要補稅，但感覺也沒在查；但如果要合規定記得注意液體只能托運，如果封起來的東西裡面有液體就只能整包托運）。

吃的部分除了有名的零食之外，我比較多找百年老店的地產，不保證好吃但保證百年；大家推薦的零食保證好吃，但保證要排隊\+不是百年ＸＤ

最後心得還是找好吃的吧！
### 後記

第一次去日本直接愛上，回來開始查下一次的日本行程。

> 其實我 6/7–11 就又跑去東京了 😝 遊記下集待續

總體來說，交通方便、安靜、氣侯怡人\(五月去體感大約是台灣秋天天氣，晚上會涼\)、人與人有邊界感、有禮貌；很喜歡！

消費照目前日幣幣值跟物價，其實比台灣還便宜。。。
#### 住行：
- 電車、公車比台灣覆蓋率更高更方便；去這麼多天只有第一天去飯店搭過計程車。
- 承上雖然交通方便，但日本幅員遼闊，大部分時候腳要夠勤，每天都走快 20,000 步
- 站左站右不一定，在京都站左在大阪又變站右
- 公車會等人坐好才開、下車會等你起身慢慢下車；所以不需要在還沒到站就開始騷動，日本人也不喜歡這樣
- 飯店衛浴，都非常乾淨舒服；再小都有浴缸
- 馬桶幾乎都是免治馬桶，如果是百貨公司的還會有背景水聲\(防尷尬\)

![5/23–5/28 步數巔峰](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*qmwiX0LqkOv-izZIFSqHeA.jpeg)

5/23–5/28 步數巔峰
#### 文化：
- 市容整潔且一體性很強 \(e\.g\. 門口都長一樣，不會出現有幾戶有鞋櫃有幾戶沒有，有就都有沒有就都沒有\)
- 沒有人邊走邊吃，都是在店門口吃完再走
- 垃圾只能帶回飯店，路邊很少垃圾桶，因此在門口吃完把垃圾還給店家最方便
- 店家只收自己店家的垃圾
- 英文基本上不通，只能用很簡單的跟比手畫腳；或用翻譯溝通；但藥妝店、大型購物中心基本上都有中文店員
- 買票、收據、找錢、給錢要記得直接放/從盤子拿，不要接觸到店員
- 避免肢體接觸及靠太近
- 公共運輸上普遍很安靜，尤其公車
- **拍照攝影盡量不要對著人拍或拍到人臉，上傳社群應該對人臉打馬賽克**
- 拍廟宇要斜拍，不能正拍
- 重視細節 SOP，另外感覺要融入日本並不容易
- 日本人普遍穿著很正式或至少會打扮，女生也都很精緻

> 另外也不要說別人怎樣，我們在環球影城就遇到台灣\(他貼🇹🇼在包包上\)類似直銷公司的員工旅遊很大聲的在裡面喊口號拍影片「喊什麼 super 讚，業績直直讚」什麼的；因為人本來就多，還擋在路中間，一群人在那喊口號，沒拍好還一直重複拍重複喊，很丟臉。

```markdown
#### Returning to Work and "Products"

My personal feeling is that if we want to enter the Japanese market, relying solely on advertising and marketing would be quite difficult; at most, we would attract some curious individuals. Japan has a strong cultural unity, and we need to find ways to integrate into their lives and habits to have a chance at winning their hearts.

Additionally, the tolerance for errors is very low. For example, bugs or unexpected appearances of other languages; while we might think that one or two occurrences are acceptable or at least should not happen frequently, I believe that for them, even one instance could lead to a negative impression, as it shows a lack of rigor and respect for them.
