Why do so many iOS apps read your clipboard?

### ⚠️ 2022/07/22 Update: Upcoming Changes in iOS 16

Starting from iOS ≥ 16, when the user does not actively paste, the app's attempt to read the clipboard will trigger a prompt, requiring the user to grant permission before the app can access clipboard information.

Top notification when the clipboard is accessed by an app

Starting with iOS 14, users are notified when an app reads their clipboard. Particularly, apps from mainland China are notoriously known for this, and with the media amplifying the reports, it has caused significant privacy panic; however, it's not just Chinese apps—many apps from the [United States](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/hejp5o/popular_apps_tiktok_npr_nyt_and_more_spying_on/){:target="_blank"}, Taiwan, Japan, and various other places around the world have also been exposed. So why do so many apps need to read the clipboard?

### Security

The clipboard may contain personal information, including passwords, such as those copied from password managers like 1Password or LastPass. If an app has the ability to read it, it also has the ability to send that information back to a server. It all depends on the developer's integrity. If one wants to investigate, they can use [man-in-the-middle sniffing](../46410aaada00/) to monitor what data the app sends back to the server, including whether it contains clipboard information.
### Background

The [Clipboard API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uipasteboard){:target="_blank"} has existed since iOS 3 in 2009; it is just that starting from iOS 14, users will receive more prompts to inform them. Over the past decade, if there were malicious apps, they would have already collected sufficient data.
### Why

Why do so many apps, both domestic and international, read the clipboard upon **opening**?

Here, I need to clarify that I am referring to the situation when the **app is opened**, not when the app reads the clipboard during use; reading the clipboard during use is more related to specific functionalities within the app, such as Google Maps automatically pasting the recently copied address, but it cannot be ruled out that some apps continuously steal clipboard information.

> "A kitchen knife can be used to chop vegetables or to kill someone, depending on what the user intends to do with it."

The main reason the app reads the clipboard upon opening is to enhance the **user experience** for the "[iOS Deferred Deep Link](../b08ef940c196/)," as shown in the process above. When a product offers both a website and an app, we prefer users to install the app (as it leads to higher engagement). Therefore, when users browse the mobile version of the website, they are directed to download the app, and we hope that upon opening the app after downloading, it will automatically display the page they were on when they left the website.

> _EX: When I browse the PxHome mobile website in Safari -> see a product I like and want to purchase -> PxHome hopes to direct traffic to the app -> download the app -> open the app -> display the product I just saw on the website._

If this is not done, users can only 1. return to the webpage and click again or 2. search for the product again within the app; either option increases the difficulty and hesitation in making a purchase, which may lead to them not buying at all!

On the other hand, from an operational perspective, knowing the source from which installations were successfully made is very helpful for marketing and advertising budget allocation.

#### Why must we use the clipboard? Are there any alternative methods?

This is a **cat-and-mouse game** because Apple does not want developers to have the ability to reverse track user sources. Before iOS 9, the method was to store information in web cookies, which could be read after the app was installed. After iOS 10, this route was blocked by Apple; with no way out, everyone resorted to the final method — "using the clipboard to transmit information" to achieve this. iOS 14 introduced a new prompt that made developers uncomfortable.

Another route is to use [Branch.io](https://branch.io/){:target="_blank"} to record user profiles (IP, mobile information) and then read the information through a matching process. This is theoretically feasible but requires a significant investment of manpower (involving backend, database, app) to research and implement, and it may lead to misjudgments or collisions.

> _*On the other hand, Android Google originally supported this functionality without the need for the roundabout methods used in iOS._ 

#### Affected Apps

Many app developers may not be aware that they also face clipboard privacy issues because Google’s Firebase Dynamic Links service uses the same principle:

```javascript
// Reason for this string to ensure that only FDL links, copied to clipboard by AppPreview Page
// JavaScript code, are recognized and used in copy-unique-match process. If user copied FDL to
// clipboard by himself, that link must not be used in copy-unique-match process.
// This constant must be kept in sync with constant in the server version at
// durabledeeplink/click/ios/click_page.js
```

> Therefore, any app that uses Google Firebase Dynamic Links service may be affected by clipboard privacy issues!

### Personal Opinion

There are indeed security issues, but it comes down to **trust**; trusting that developers will do the right thing. If developers intend to do harm, there are many other ways to do so, such as stealing credit card information or recording real passwords, which are far more effective than this.

> The purpose of the prompt is to make users aware of when the clipboard is being accessed; if it seems unreasonable, they should be cautious!

#### Reader Questions

Q: "Is TikTok's response that accessing the clipboard is to detect spam behavior correct?"

A: Personally, I believe this is just an excuse to deflect public opinion. TikTok's intention seems to be "to prevent users from copying and pasting advertising messages everywhere"; however, it could actually filter or block this when the message is completed or sent, without the need to constantly monitor the user's clipboard information! Should they also monitor if the clipboard contains advertisements or "sensitive" information? I haven't pasted anything to publish it.

### What Developers Can Do

If you don't have a spare device to upgrade to iOS 14 for testing, you can first download [XCode 12 from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/){:target="_blank"} and test it using the simulator.

Everything is still very new. If you are using Firebase, you can refer to [Firebase-iOS-SDK/Issue #5893](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/issues/5893){:target="_blank"} to update to the latest SDK.

If you are implementing DeepLink yourself, you can refer to the modifications in Firebase-iOS-SDK [#PR 5905](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/pull/5905){:target="_blank"}:

Swift:
```swift
if #available(iOS 10.0, *) {
  if (UIPasteboard.general.hasURLs) {
      //UIPasteboard.general.string
  }
} else {
  //UIPasteboard.general.string
}
```

Objective-C:
```c
if (@available(iOS 10.0, *)) {
    if ([[UIPasteboard generalPasteboard] hasURLs]) {
      //[UIPasteboard generalPasteboard].string;
    }
  } else {
    //[UIPasteboard generalPasteboard].string;
  }
  return pasteboardContents;
}
```

First, check if the clipboard content is a URL (the content copied via web JavaScript is a URL with parameters) before reading it, so that the app does not prompt every time it is opened regarding clipboard access.


> _Currently, this is the only way; the prompt will still appear, but it will be more focused._



Additionally, Apple has introduced a new API: [DetectPattern](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uipasteboard/3621870-detectpatternsforpatterns?changes=latest_minor&language=objc){:target="_blank"}, which helps developers more accurately determine if the clipboard information is what we need before reading it and prompting the user, allowing users to feel more secure and enabling developers to continue using this feature.


> _DetectPattern is still in Beta and can only be implemented in Objective-C._




#### Or…
- Switch to [Branch.io](https://branch.io){:target="_blank"}
- Implement the principles of Branch.io yourself
- **The app first shows a customized alert to inform the user, then reads the clipboard (to reassure the user)**
- Add new privacy terms
- **iOS 14's latest App Clips? Web -> Direct to App Clips for lightweight use -> Deep dive into the app**
