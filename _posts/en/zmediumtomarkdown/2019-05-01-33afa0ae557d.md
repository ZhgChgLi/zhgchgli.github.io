### AirPods 2 Unboxing and Hands-On Experience (Laser Engraved Version)
#### More ingenious, incredibly amazing.

#### [\[Latest\] Apple Watch Series 6 Unboxing & Two-Year Experience &gt;&gt;&gt; Click here](../eab0e984043/)

When AirPods first came out, I didn't pay much attention; at first glance, they seemed like a wireless Bluetooth headset resembling a showerhead, and at that time, the wireless Bluetooth headset market was flourishing with various options. You could find products that matched any style or need, and the prices were not friendly, so what was so special about them?

It wasn't until I actually got my hands on them that I felt their **"amazing"** qualities. Since their launch, AirPods have consistently dominated the Bluetooth headset sales rankings, and this is not just due to the loyalty of Apple fans. So what makes them so useful? Let's continue to explore.

### Background of Purchase

Originally, I was just a simple iPhone user. Last year, I got a MacBook Pro and an [Apple Watch S4](../a2920e33e73e/), and I started to get immersed in the Apple ecosystem (commonly known as the Apple family bundle). Having bought the watch, I was just missing a pair of headphones.

The Bluetooth headset I was using had served me for a while; it was a decent headset—neither bad nor particularly outstanding, with average sound quality and sufficient battery life. If I had to point out its shortcomings, it would be that the call quality was unclear, the signal was easily interfered with, and it required a long press to turn on and off, with unclear pairing and battery indicators. These were all minor issues. I usually used it for commuting and exercising, while I mostly used speakers or wired headphones in front of the computer, so it met my basic needs.

After the release of AirPods 1, most of my friends had positive experiences with them. This time, I happened to catch the trend of AirPods 2, so I decided to get them.

_p.s. Since I had never used the first generation, my considerations for purchasing were not based on comparisons with the first generation, and this article will not mention the differences with the first generation._

### Choosing Between Wireless and Wired Versions

The price difference between the wireless and wired versions is $1,200. Initially, I was considering buying the wireless version; thinking about the messy charging cables on my nightstand and how I could travel with one less cable made it quite tempting for convenience!

After Apple announced that AirPower was dead, I searched online for similar products and bought a 2-in-1 wireless charging version, which could charge both the iPhone and Apple Watch. Since the iPhone and AirPods don't usually need to be charged at the same time, it could be used as a 3-in-1.

Everything seemed great until I placed the order and received the product. In actual use, I found that I couldn't charge both the phone and the watch simultaneously; the watch's charging level was almost zero, and the speed was very slow—the current just couldn't keep up! Even using a 5.1V/2.1A adapter didn't help. I checked [user reviews](https://www.facebook.com/gusha.tw/posts/1219673421523621?comment_id=1255505397940423){:target="_blank"}, and this situation was not unique. In the end, I reluctantly returned it.

Thinking about it, it was just two cables (both the AirPods and iPhone use lightning, while the Apple Watch uses a dedicated cable), and the speed is still faster with wired connections. The wireless version would require that version + the cable + possibly a larger adapter? Compared to that, there was no particular convenience advantage.

**So in the end, I chose the wired version of AirPods 2.**

> p.s. The only difference between the wireless and wired versions is that the charging case for the wired version is the same as the first generation (with the indicator light inside); the wireless version has the indicator light outside and can also be charged with a wired connection.

### Placing the Order

From the announcement to the sale (in Taiwan), it took about a month. I checked the official website daily to see if it was available, and I'm sure many netizens did the same XD; the wait was truly nerve-wracking, especially since other countries had already started selling!

On April 23, when it went on sale, I immediately placed my order. This time, AirPods 2 could be laser engraved (customized), so of course, I had to get it engraved:

You can engrave **11 characters**, including Chinese/English/symbols/spaces; testing shows that most symbols should work, and unsupported ones will display “Cannot engrave these characters:”, so there’s no need to worry about garbled text.

_p.s. Engraving may take an additional week; if you don’t want engraving, you can buy directly at 101 or through distributors (prices are cheaper)_

The estimated arrival time given by the official source is: 5/3~5/10, and I was notified on 4/29 that it shipped from Shanghai. Fortunately, I received it on 4/30 just before the May Day holiday (super fast!! From Shanghai to Taipei)

The unboxing is complete! Overall, it feels substantial, and the hand feel and quality are excellent; the engraving is also very detailed; it meets the standards expected of an Apple product!
### Usage
#### First Use:


![](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*GdIZpl46uQiX50zIkoLSjw.jpeg)


When using the brand new AirPods for the first time, simply open the AirPods case near your iPhone, and it will prompt you to pair; there’s no need to press the pairing button.
#### Setting Up Headphone Operations:

**Mobile Version:**


![Open "Settings" -> "Bluetooth" -> "Find Your AirPods" -> "Settings"](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*Aktq6bFF9dDTfWXxrUSQTA.jpeg)

Open "Settings" -> "Bluetooth" -> "Find Your AirPods" -> "Settings"

**MacBook Version:**


![Top left "" -> "System Preferences" -> "Bluetooth" (if there's no sound, please select AirPods)](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*lkDI9yIkdo1X-FmqAftxpA.jpeg)

Top left "" -> "System Preferences" -> "Bluetooth" (if there's no sound, please select AirPods)

You can choose the double-tap action for each ear.

**The click location is just below the small hole on the side of the headphone body:**

#### Some Tips

**Quickly switch back to using iPhone:**


![Pull up the menu -> select the audio block -> select the top right icon -> switch to AirPods](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*WAp5lJK3JPqsKEY6tX840g.jpeg)

Pull up the menu -> select the audio block -> select the top right icon -> switch to AirPods

You can also check the battery level of the AirPods here (shows the battery level of the one with lower charge).

**Using a widget to check battery level:**


![Swipe left to Control Center -> bottom "Edit" -> find "Batteries" to add and sort](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*CvQhTsxObgHlso2DfbQLTg.jpeg)

Swipe left to Control Center -> bottom "Edit" -> find "Batteries" to add and sort

From now on, you can directly swipe left in the Control Center to check the AirPods battery level (shows the battery level of the one with lower charge). To check the battery levels of both ears and the case, you need to place one of the AirPods back in the case and open the case (since the case itself does not have Bluetooth functionality):

*Inside the box are the dust-proof stickers I applied


> There is a bug here; if your battery tool shows the power level and then disappears, please go to "Settings" -> "Display & Brightness" -> "Text Size" -> and revert to the default size (the third option)!


**How to check battery on Apple Watch:**


![Swipe up to control center -> tap on battery](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*A7ZVJoLehIN14J0LM5Y3qA.jpeg)

Swipe up to control center -> tap on battery

The battery display window on the Apple Watch will also show the battery level of the AirPods below.

_p.s. However, there seems to be a bug where it sometimes does not display._
#### Additional Information about Battery:


> 1. When the AirPods battery is low, you will hear a chime in one or both AirPods. You will hear a chime once when the battery is low, and another chime will sound before the AirPods turn off.


> 2. If the AirPods are in the charging case with the lid open, the indicator light shows the charging status of the AirPods. If the AirPods are not in the charging case, the indicator light shows the status of the charging case. Green indicates fully charged, while amber indicates there is less than one full charge left.

### User Experience


![](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*vlDbOyPlOGtttbTXf-Q_IA.jpeg)


Before sharing my experience, let me mention a recent entrepreneurial story I heard; in short, it is: "When making a product, we should not target a broad range, but rather choose a small niche and then gradually expand."

The biggest difference between AirPods and other brands of Bluetooth headphones is the attention to small details in the experience. For example, when you take one earbud out, the music automatically pauses, and when you put it back in, it resumes playback. Plus, you can use them right out of the case without worrying about turning them on or off or connecting them. In terms of comfort, you can hardly feel their presence when wearing them.

The charging speed is incredibly fast, and they automatically charge when placed in the case; so you just need to pay a little attention to whether the case still has power (the case can charge about five times), and you won't encounter the issue of needing to use Bluetooth headphones only to find they are out of battery and having to wait for them to charge.

The latency is as rumored; when watching videos or playing games, you can hardly feel any delay (I tested it with a racing game).

**As for Hey Siri**, I initially thought it was a bit unnecessary since I have a watch that can also activate Hey Siri from a distance; however, after experiencing it, as mentioned above, everything is about "the details." The Hey Siri feature on AirPods takes it to another level, allowing you to call Hey Siri without even raising your hand; you can just call Hey Siri directly, achieving a truly omnipresent feeling with Siri. 

A possible scenario is when you are tidying up around the house with both hands full; at this time, this feature is quite convenient! Also, you can **call Siri to adjust the volume**: "Hey Siri! Turn it up," "Hey Siri! Set the volume to 75%."

To summarize my experience using AirPods in one sentence:


> "Everything feels so natural."


You don't need to spend energy on unnecessary things; headphones should just be headphones.

**The call quality** is equally impressive; in addition to stable basic call quality, the pickup quality rivals that of a microphone, which is truly amazing. During a test call with a friend, he could hardly tell I was using AirPods!

**As for wearing them while riding a bike**, I was initially looking forward to using them for navigation while riding, but a friend who has the first generation said, "No way." With more than 3/4 of a helmet, the process of putting on the helmet presses against the ears, making it easy for the earbuds to fall out. I tested this as well and felt a bit nervous; I recommend that if you need to listen to navigation while riding, just wear one earbud, as it is safer to focus on one ear when putting on and taking off the helmet.
#### **Cons:**

Ultimately, I still need to mention the drawbacks I perceive.

The gestures for controlling functions are too few... I am really used to controlling the volume with gestures (but fortunately, I can control Spotify volume with my watch).

Additionally, while the connection speed to the phone is indeed very fast, the connection speed to the computer is slower: my MacBook Pro 2018 is quite slow, but another Mac Mini connects as quickly as the phone.

The TESTV review channel also mentioned that when using the MacBook Pro with the lid closed and connected externally, the signal with AirPods would be intermittent! (I don't have this issue).

However, why are there these differences? I guess it is due to other signal interference (lights, screen output, other Bluetooth devices), right?
#### Rumors:
1. The size and shape are the same as wired EarPods, making them easy to fall out:
First, the size and shape differ from EarPods; I find EarPods a bit loose, but AirPods feel very secure, and they don't fall out even when jumping around. However, it really depends on the person; some may indeed experience fit issues, so I recommend borrowing a pair from a friend who has AirPods to try them on before purchasing!
[_*Or you can stick some artificial skin on the earbud tips to increase surface area and resistance_](https://applealmond.com/posts/35916){:target="_blank"}
2. The sound quality is very similar to EarPods: As mentioned, there is actually a significant difference; the sound quality of AirPods is much better. I feel that although there may be a gap compared to headphones in the same price range that focus on sound quality, and they lack noise-canceling features, AirPods themselves are not sound quality-oriented headphones, so the choice depends on personal preference. 

From my personal experience, the sound quality has noticeable surround layers and a wide sound range, overall maintaining a good standard!

### Accessories:

Due to my clumsy hands, I treat my AirPods like a fragile egg, and I'm really afraid of dropping them and breaking them; after reading many recommendations for protective cases, quite a few people recommended this one: Catalyst AirPods Waterproof Storage Case (Protective Case).

The reasons for choosing this one are: waterproof, drop-resistant, has a hook, and is convenient to use (you don't need to take it off when retrieving the earbuds or charging).

Price: around $1000

**Mini Unboxing:**

_p.s. To be able to use the AirPods immediately, I actually bought the case before the AirPods 😂_

**Question from netizens: Can the protective cases for the 1st and 2nd generation be interchangeable?**

The distinction is not between the 1st or 2nd generation, but between wired and wireless versions; if you have the wired version, both the 1st and 2nd generations can be used. For the wireless version, the indicator light is on the outside, and the pairing button is positioned more centrally on the back, making it incompatible with the wired version. This is something to be aware of ⚠️

#### Next is the dust-proof sticker inside the case:

![AHA AirPods Dust-proof Sticker](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*mgL_FMaH5So-U0iAGJsVFg.jpeg)

AHA AirPods Dust-proof Sticker

**Some netizens asked about the fit:**

If not applied well, it may not fit perfectly; it took me a long time to get it to fit completely. The edges feel slightly rough (doesn't affect functionality, could be due to tolerances?).

It's a bit difficult to apply because the dust-proof sticker is a metal piece, and the case itself has magnets that can easily pull it away while aiming.

Currently, I feel it's somewhat unnecessary; I'm not sure how effective it will be after some time, so I will remain cautious for now.

### Anti-fraud Awareness

Please be especially careful, as counterfeit versions with cracked chips have appeared across the strait, pairing with the same animations and battery displays, and are almost indistinguishable from the genuine ones.

The main identification methods currently focus on software:
1. Battery display: Genuine ones can show the battery levels for the left ear, right ear, and case / counterfeit only shows one.
2. In Bluetooth settings, genuine ones can set click functions for the left and right ears / counterfeit only has disconnect and forget options.
3. The charging case indicator light on genuine ones will turn off after connecting / counterfeit will remain lit.

However, it is uncertain whether counterfeit versions will fix these issues in the future, so it's safer to purchase from official or major retail channels.

### ⚠️ Unethical merchants are now more rampant, selling counterfeits at prices close to genuine ones ⚠

Recently, I discovered unscrupulous merchants on Facebook and Google ad networks selling counterfeits at prices close to genuine ones (the website is a common [one-page scam site](https://www.facebook.com/ecotcpd/posts/%E5%85%AD%E5%A4%A7%E7%89%B9%E5%BE%B5%E7%A0%B4%E8%A7%A3%E4%B8%80%E9%A0%81%E5%BC%8F%E5%BB%A3%E5%91%8A%E8%A9%90%E9%A8%99%E8%BF%91%E6%9C%9F%E8%87%89%E6%9B%B8line%E5%8F%8A%E5%90%84%E5%A4%A7%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF%E5%B9%B3%E8%87%BA%E4%B8%8A%E5%87%BA%E7%8F%BE%E8%A8%B1%E5%A4%9A%E4%B8%80%E9%A0%81%E5%BC%8F%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF%E8%B3%BC%E7%89%A9%E5%BB%A3%E5%91%8A%E5%9B%A0%E7%82%BA%E5%95%86%E5%93%81%E5%83%B9%E6%A0%BC%E6%AF%94%E5%B8%82%E5%83%B9%E4%BD%8E%E4%BA%86%E5%A5%BD%E5%B9%BE%E5%80%8D%E8%A8%B1%E5%A4%9A%E7%B6%B2%E8%B3%BC%E6%97%8F%E5%9B%A0%E8%80%8C%E4%B8%8B%E6%A8%99%E8%B3%BC%E8%B2%B7%E6%94%B6%E5%88%B0%E8%B2%A8%E5%93%81%E5%BE%8C%E6%89%8D%E7%99%BC%E7%8F%BE%E8%88%87%E7%B6%B2%E9%A0%81%E6%89%80%E5%88%8A/1986377751611350/){:target="_blank"}), which is very malicious; I think if you are trying to save a little money and spend around 1000 to buy AirPods, you should be aware that it might be fake, but selling counterfeits at genuine prices is truly low-class!

> _Please note that the price of the brand new AirPods should not be lower than $4500._
