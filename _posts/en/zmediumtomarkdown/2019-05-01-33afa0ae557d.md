### AirPods 2 Unboxing and Initial Experience Review (Laser Engraved Edition)

#### More clever, incredibly impressive.

#### [[Latest] Apple Watch Series 6 Unboxing & Two-Year Usage Experience >>> Click Here](../eab0e984043/)

When AirPods first came out, I didn't pay much attention; at first glance, they just looked like wireless Bluetooth earbuds shaped like a showerhead. At that time, the wireless Bluetooth earbud market was already crowded with many options, covering every style and need you could think of, plus the price wasn't affordable. What was so special about them?

I only truly appreciated its **"amazing"** qualities after using it myself. Since its launch, AirPods have consistently ranked among the top-selling Bluetooth earphones, and this reputation is well-earned. It's not just the loyalty of Apple fans. So, what makes it so good? Let's continue reading.

[True Fragrance Meme](https://www.ettoday.net/news/20181227/1341755.htm){:target="_blank"}

### Background of Acquisition

Originally just a simple iPhone user, last year I got a MacBook Pro and an [Apple Watch S4](../a2920e33e73e/), starting to fall into the Apple ecosystem (commonly called the Apple family bucket). I bought the watch, but was still missing a pair of earphones.

The Bluetooth earphones I was originally using had been in service for a while. They were a fairly standard model—not bad but nothing outstanding. The sound quality was average, and the battery life was sufficient. The main issues were unclear call quality, signal interference, long press needed to power on/off, waiting for pairing, and unclear battery indicators—small annoyances. I mostly used them for commuting and exercising, while at the computer I usually used speakers or wired earphones, so they met my basic needs.

After the release of AirPods 1st generation, most of my friends had positive experiences. This time, I decided to follow the trend and got the AirPods 2nd generation.

*p.s. Since I have never used the 1st generation, my reasons for purchasing will not focus on improvements compared to the 1st generation (this article will not mention differences from the 1st generation).*

### Choosing Between Wireless or Wired Versions?

The wireless and wired versions differ by $1,200. At first, I was considering buying the wireless version; thinking about the messy charging cables on my bedside table and having one less cable to carry when traveling abroad, the convenience really tempted me!

After Apple announced the cancellation of AirPower, I searched online for similar products and bought a 2-in-1 wireless charging pad for iPhone and Apple Watch. Since iPhone and AirPods don’t often need charging at the same time, alternating their use allows it to function as a 3-in-1 charger.

Everything seemed fine until I placed the order and received the product. When I actually used it, I found that it couldn't charge both my phone and watch simultaneously. The watch's battery level was almost 0%, and the charging speed was very slow. The current just couldn't ramp up! Even using a 5.1V/2.1A charger didn't help. I'm not sure what voltage charger is needed. Checking [user reviews](https://www.facebook.com/gusha.tw/posts/1219673421523621?comment_id=1255505397940423){:target="_blank"}, this issue is not isolated. In the end, I reluctantly returned it.

Just two cables (AirPods and iPhone both use Lightning / Apple Watch has a dedicated cable), and wired is still faster; wireless requires that version + the board's cable + possibly a bigger connector? Compared to that, there's no clear convenience advantage.

**So in the end, I chose the wired version of AirPods 2.**

> p.s. The difference between the wireless and wired versions is that the wired version's charging case is the same as the first generation (indicator light inside); the wireless version's charging case has the indicator light outside and can also be charged with a cable.

### Ordering

From the announcement to the sale (Taiwan), about one month passed. Every day, I checked the official website three times a day to see if the sale had started. I believe many users did the same XD; it was really nerve-wracking, especially since other countries had already started selling!

4/23 As soon as it went on sale, I placed an order immediately. This time, AirPods 2 can be laser engraved (engraving), so of course I got it engraved:

![ΛVICII ◢ ◤ — Official Preview Image](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*Mq5OL0FPCng7aWCk7WuIZQ.png)

> “One day you’ll leave this world behind So live a life you will remember.” [Avicii — The Nights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtF6Jej8yb4){:target="_blank"}

You can engrave **11 characters**, including Chinese/English/symbols/spaces; most symbols are supported in tests. If unsupported, it will show "Cannot engrave these characters:", so no need to worry about garbled text.

*p.s Engraving takes about one extra week. Without engraving, you can buy directly at 101 or through dealers (cheaper prices).*

The official estimated delivery time is: 5/3~5/10. On 4/29, I was notified that the shipment left Shanghai. Luckily, I received it on 4/30, just before the Labor Day holiday on May 1st (super fast!! From Shanghai to Taipei).

Unboxing is done! The overall weight feels substantial, and the texture and quality are excellent. The engraving is also very detailed; it meets the standard expected of Apple products!

### Usage

#### First Use:

![](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*GdIZpl46uQiX50zIkoLSjw.jpeg)

When using brand new AirPods for the first time, simply open the AirPods case near your iPhone, and a prompt will appear to complete the pairing; there is no need to press the pairing button.

#### Set up headphone controls:

**Mobile Version:**

![Open "Settings" -> "Bluetooth" -> "Find your AirPods" -> "Settings"](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*Aktq6bFF9dDTfWXxrUSQTA.jpeg)

Open "Settings" -> "Bluetooth" -> "Find your AirPods" -> "Settings"

**MacBook Version:**

![Top left corner "" -> "System Preferences" -> "Bluetooth" (If no sound, please switch the audio output to AirPods)](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*lkDI9yIkdo1X-FmqAftxpA.jpeg)

Top left corner "" -> "System Preferences" -> "Bluetooth" (If no sound, please switch the audio output to AirPods)

You can choose the double-tap action for either the left or right ear.

**Click location is below the small hole on the upper side of the earphone body:**

![Actually, I explored a bit to find the location](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*Mm_AMBVgSu6KhflqIOkNGg@2x.jpeg)

Actually, I had to explore a bit to find the location.

#### Some Tips

**Quickly switch back to using on iPhone:**

![Pull down menu -> Select audio block -> Choose top right icon -> Switch to AirPods](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*WAp5lJK3JPqsKEY6tX840g.jpeg)

Pull up the menu -> Select the audio section -> Tap the icon at the top right -> Switch to AirPods

You can also check the AirPods battery level here. (Shows the battery level of the one with lower power)

**How to Check Battery Level Using Widgets:**

![Swipe left to Control Center -> tap "Edit" at the bottom -> find "Battery" to add and reorder](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*CvQhTsxObgHlso2DfbQLTg.jpeg)

Swipe left to Control Center -> tap "Edit" at the bottom -> find "Battery" to add and reorder

In the future, you can swipe left on the Control Center to directly check the AirPods battery level (showing the battery of the earbud with lower charge). To see the battery levels of the left and right earbuds and the case, you need to put one AirPod back into the case and open the case (because the case itself has no Bluetooth function):

![*The dust-proof film I applied inside the box](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*qoUfpf1Jh_jVrHN_l3QRew.jpeg)

*Inside the box are the dust-proof stickers I applied

> There is a BUG where your battery widget shows the battery level briefly and then disappears; please go to "Settings" -> "Display & Brightness" -> "Text Size" -> reset to the default size (third level) to fix it!

**How to Check Battery Level on Apple Watch:**

![Swipe up Control Center -> Tap Battery](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*A7ZVJoLehIN14J0LM5Y3qA.jpeg)

Swipe up Control Center -> Tap Battery

The battery display window on the Apple Watch will also show the AirPods battery level below.

*p.s. But there seems to be a BUG sometimes it doesn't display*

#### Additional Notes on Battery:

> 1. When the AirPod battery is low, you will hear a chime in one or both AirPods. You will hear one chime when the battery is low, and another chime before the AirPods turn off.

> 2. If AirPods are in the charging case with the lid open, the indicator light shows the AirPods' charging status. If the AirPods are not in the case, the indicator light shows the case's status. Green means fully charged, while amber means less than one full charge remains.

### User Experience

![](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*vlDbOyPlOGtttbTXf-Q_IA.jpeg)

Before writing my reflections, let me share a recent startup story I heard; in short: "When creating a product, we should not target a broad audience but focus on a small niche and then gradually expand."

The biggest difference between AirPods and other brands of Bluetooth earphones lies in the small-scale detailed experience. For example, music automatically pauses when you take one earbud out and resumes when you put it back in. You can use them right away when you take them out, and just put them back when not in use, without worrying about turning them on, off, or connecting. In terms of comfort, you can hardly feel they are there when wearing them.

Charging is very fast, and it automatically charges when placed in the case; so you only need to keep an eye on the case's battery level (the case can charge about 5 times). You rarely encounter situations where the Bluetooth earphones are dead and you have to wait for them to charge slowly.

The delay is just as rumored; when watching videos or playing games, the lag is almost unnoticeable (I tested with the racing game Speed Domain).

**The Hey Siri feature** initially seemed unnecessary since I could already use Hey Siri remotely with my watch. But after trying it, as mentioned above, it's all about the "detailed experience." Hey Siri on AirPods takes it to another level—you don’t even need to raise your hand to activate it. You can just say Hey Siri directly, achieving a truly omnipresent Siri experience.  
A common scenario is when you’re tidying up and both hands are full; this feature becomes very convenient!  
Also, you can **ask Siri to adjust the volume**: "Hey Siri! Louder," or "Hey Siri! Set volume to 75%."

A one-sentence summary of using AirPods is:

> "Everything is so natural"

You don't need to worry about unnecessary things; headphones should just be headphones.

**Call Quality** is equally impressive. Besides stable basic call quality, the microphone performance is outstanding, almost like a professional mic—truly amazing. During a test call with a friend, they could hardly tell I was using AirPods!

**Wearing While Riding**: I originally looked forward to listening to navigation while riding, but friends who have the first generation device said it’s not feasible. With more than 3/4 of the helmet on, the helmet pressing against the ears causes the earphones to fall off easily. This was confirmed in actual tests, which was a bit alarming. It’s recommended to only wear one earbud when riding and listening to navigation, as focusing on one ear is safer when putting on or taking off the helmet.

#### **Disadvantages:**

Finally, I have to mention the drawbacks I noticed.

There are too few items controllable by gestures… I’m really used to controlling volume with gestures (but thankfully, the watch can control Spotify volume).

Also, the connection speed on the phone is indeed very fast, but the connection speed on my computer: my MacBook Pro 2018 is quite slow, while another Mac Mini connects as fast as the phone.

The TESTV review channel also mentioned that when using the MacBook Pro closed with an external display, the AirPods signal would cut in and out! (I don't experience this issue)

However, why are there these differences? I guess it's because of other signal interference (lights, screen output, other Bluetooth devices).

#### Rumor Clarification:

1. The size and shape are similar to wired EarPods, with the issue of easily falling off:  
   First, there is a difference in size and shape compared to EarPods. I find EarPods a bit loose, but AirPods feel very stable and don’t fall off even when moving around. However, it really depends on the person; some may experience fit issues. It’s recommended to borrow a pair from a friend who has AirPods to try before buying!  
   [**Or stick some artificial leather on the earbud to increase surface area and friction**](https://applealmond.com/posts/35916){:target="_blank"}

2. Sound quality is similar to EarPods: Actually, there is a big difference; AirPods have much better sound quality. Although it may fall short compared to other headphones in the same price range that focus on sound quality and lacks noise cancellation, AirPods are not designed primarily for sound quality, so it depends on personal preference.  
   From my personal experience, the sound quality shows clear surround layers and a wide range, maintaining a good overall standard!

### Accessories:

Because I have buttery hands, my AirPods are like an egg to me—I’m afraid they’ll slip and break easily. After reading many protective case recommendations, many people suggest this one: Catalyst AirPods Waterproof Carrying Case (Protective Case).

The reasons for choosing this are: waterproof, drop-resistant, has a hook, and convenient to use (no need to remove it when taking out earphones or charging).

Price: Around $1000

**Mini Unboxing:**

![Front side, bought dark color to avoid dirt](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*Lw1clUAV8LkY9BmFN5LqBg.jpeg)

Front side: I bought a dark color because I was afraid of dirt.

![Buttons with corresponding paired keys on the back](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*5qO-NZPG1EO1XtYG-oCJyQ.jpeg)

There are also corresponding paired keys on the back.

![Just flip open the top half to take out the earphones](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*gI9dn0sq2HzRo2Q5wjTN5A.jpeg)

To wear the earbuds, simply flip open the top half.

![The bottom charging port has a cover that can be opened and closed](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*BJKzNjJeASWYHr9pDjzoQQ.jpeg)

The charging port at the bottom has a cover that can be opened and closed.

*p.s. To use the AirPods right away, I actually bought the case before the AirPods 😂*

**User Question: Can the cases for the 1st and 2nd generation be used interchangeably?**

The distinction is not between generation 1 or 2, but between wired and wireless versions. If you have the wired version, both generation 1 and 2 are compatible. The wireless version has an indicator light on the outside and a pairing button located near the top center on the back. It cannot share a protective case with the wired version, so please pay attention to this ⚠️

#### Next is the dust-proof sticker inside the box:

![AHA AirPods Dustproof Stickers](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*mgL_FMaH5So-U0iAGJsVFg.jpeg)

AHA AirPods Dustproof Sticker

**A user asked about the fit issue:**

If not applied properly, it won’t fit tightly. I spent a long time making it fit perfectly; the edges feel slightly rough to the touch (doesn’t affect use, possibly due to tolerance?).

It's not easy to stick because the dust-proof sticker is a metal sheet, and the box itself has magnets that can easily pull it off during alignment.

Currently, I find it somewhat unnecessary and am unsure of the effects after using it for a while, so I remain cautious for now.

### Anti-Fraud Awareness

Please be especially careful. Counterfeit versions of the chip have appeared across the strait, featuring the same pairing animation and battery display, making them nearly indistinguishable from the original in appearance.

The current main identification method is through software:

1. Battery Display: The genuine product shows battery levels for the left ear, right ear, and case separately; the counterfeit only shows one.

2. In the Bluetooth settings, the genuine version allows you to set click functions for the left and right ear; the counterfeit version only has disconnect and forget options.

3. The charging case indicator light turns off when connected to a genuine product / stays on with a counterfeit one

But since it’s uncertain whether counterfeit versions will be fixed later, it’s safer for everyone to buy from official or major retail channels.

### ⚠️Unethical merchants are now more rampant, selling pirated goods at prices close to the genuine ones⚠

Recently, on Facebook and Google Ad Network, I found some unscrupulous sellers offering pirated products at prices close to the genuine ones (the website is a common [one-page scam page](https://www.facebook.com/ecotcpd/posts/%E5%85%AD%E5%A4%A7%E7%89%B9%E5%BE%B5%E7%A0%B4%E8%A7%A3%E4%B8%80%E9%A0%81%E5%BC%8F%E5%BB%A3%E5%91%8A%E8%A9%90%E9%A8%99%E8%BF%91%E6%9C%9F%E8%87%89%E6%9B%B8line%E5%8F%8A%E5%90%84%E5%A4%A7%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF%E5%B9%B3%E8%87%BA%E4%B8%8A%E5%87%BA%E7%8F%BE%E8%A8%B1%E5%A4%9A%E4%B8%80%E9%A0%81%E5%BC%8F%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF%E8%B3%BC%E7%89%A9%E5%BB%A3%E5%91%8A%E5%9B%A0%E7%82%BA%E5%95%86%E5%93%81%E5%83%B9%E6%A0%BC%E6%AF%94%E5%B8%82%E5%83%B9%E4%BD%8E%E4%BA%86%E5%A5%BD%E5%B9%BE%E5%80%8D%E8%A8%B1%E5%A4%9A%E7%B6%B2%E8%B3%BC%E6%97%8F%E5%9B%A0%E8%80%8C%E4%B8%8B%E6%A8%99%E8%B3%BC%E8%B2%B7%E6%94%B6%E5%88%B0%E8%B2%A8%E5%93%81%E5%BE%8C%E6%89%8D%E7%99%BC%E7%8F%BE%E8%88%87%E7%B6%B2%E9%A0%81%E6%89%80%E5%88%8A/1986377751611350/){:target="_blank"} ), which is very malicious; I think if you are trying to save a little money by spending around 1000 to buy AirPods, you should be aware that they are fake, but selling pirated products at genuine prices is really low-level!

> *Please note, the price of brand new AirPods should not be below $4500.*
