### AirPods 2 Unboxing and Hands-On Experience \(Laser Engraved Edition\)
#### More clever, incredibly amazing.

#### [\[Latest\] Apple Watch Series 6 Unboxing & Two-Year Experience Review &gt;&gt;&gt; Click here](../eab0e984043/)

When AirPods first came out, I didn't pay much attention; at first glance, they just looked like wireless Bluetooth headphones resembling a showerhead. At that time, the wireless Bluetooth headphone market was already saturated with options, and you could find products that matched any style or need, plus the prices weren't friendly. What was so special about them?

It wasn't until I actually got my hands on them that I felt their **"wow factor."** Since their launch, AirPods have consistently dominated the Bluetooth headphone sales charts, and this is not just due to the loyalty of Apple fans. So what makes them so good? Let's continue to explore.

### Background of Purchase

I was originally just a regular iPhone user, but last year I got a MacBook Pro and an [Apple Watch S4](../a2920e33e73e/), and I started to get immersed in the Apple ecosystem (commonly referred to as the "Apple Family Bundle"). I had bought a watch, but I was still missing a pair of headphones.

The Bluetooth headphones I was using had been in service for a while; they were average headphones—not bad, but not particularly outstanding either. The sound quality was mediocre, but the battery life was sufficient. If I had to point out some issues, it would be that the call quality was unclear, the signal was easily interfered with, and turning them on and off required a long press, plus the pairing and battery indicators were unclear—these were all minor problems. I usually used them for commuting and exercising, and when I was at my computer, I mostly used speakers or wired headphones, so they met my basic needs.

After the release of AirPods 1, most of my friends had positive experiences with them. This time, I decided to jump on the trend with AirPods 2.

_p\.s\. Since I had never used the first generation, my considerations for purchasing were not based on comparisons with the first generation, and this article will not mention the differences from the first generation._

### Choosing: Wireless or Wired Version?

The wireless and wired versions had a price difference of $1,200. Initially, I was considering buying the wireless version; I thought about the messy charging cables on my nightstand and how I could avoid bringing an extra cable when traveling. The convenience was very tempting!

After Apple announced that AirPower was dead, I searched online for similar products and bought a 2-in-1 wireless charging version that could charge both the iPhone and Apple Watch. Since the iPhone and AirPods don't usually need to be charged at the same time, I could use them interchangeably for a 3-in-1 setup.

Everything seemed great until I received the product and found out that I couldn't charge my phone and watch simultaneously. The watch's charging was almost zero, and the speed was very slow; the current just couldn't keep up! Even using a 5.1V/2.1A adapter didn't help. After checking [user reviews](https://www.facebook.com/gusha.tw/posts/1219673421523621?comment_id=1255505397940423){:target="_blank"}, I found that this situation was not unique, and I ended up reluctantly returning it.

Thinking about it, it was just two cables (both the AirPods and iPhone use Lightning, while the Apple Watch uses a proprietary cable), and the speed of wired charging was still faster. Wireless charging required that version + the appropriate cable + possibly a larger adapter? In comparison, there was no significant convenience advantage.

**So in the end, I chose the wired version of AirPods 2.**

> p\.s\. The only difference between the wireless and wired versions is that the wired version's charging case is the same as the first generation (including the indicator light), while the wireless version's charging case has the indicator light on the outside and can also be charged with a cable.

### Placing the Order

From the announcement to the sale (in Taiwan), it took about a month. I checked the official website daily to see if they were available, and I'm sure many others did too XD; it was really nerve-wracking waiting, especially since other countries had already started selling them!

On April 23, when they went on sale, I immediately placed my order. This time, AirPods 2 could be laser engraved, so of course, I had to get it engraved:

You can engrave **11 characters**, including Chinese/English/symbols/spaces; I tested and found that most symbols are supported. If a symbol is not supported, it will display "Unable to engrave these characters," so there's no need to worry about garbled text.

_p\.s\. Engraving takes about an extra week; if you don't want engraving, you can buy directly at 101 or through a distributor (which is cheaper)._

The estimated delivery time given by the official site was: 5/3~5/10. On April 29, I was notified that it shipped from Shanghai, and luckily, I received it on April 30, just before the May Day holiday (super fast!! From Shanghai to Taipei).

The unboxing is complete! Overall, it feels substantial, and the hand feel and quality are excellent; the engraving is also very detailed—it's the standard you would expect from an Apple product!

### Usage
#### First Use:

![](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*GdIZpl46uQiX50zIkoLSjw.jpeg)

When using the brand new AirPods for the first time, simply open the AirPods case near your iPhone, and it will prompt you to pair them; there's no need to press a pairing button.

#### Setting Up Headphone Controls:

**Mobile Version:**

![Open "Settings" -> "Bluetooth" -> "Find Your AirPods" -> "Settings"](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*Aktq6bFF9dDTfWXxrUSQTA.jpeg)

Open "Settings" -> "Bluetooth" -> "Find Your AirPods" -> "Settings"

**MacBook Version:**

![Top Left "" -> "System Preferences" -> "Bluetooth" (If there's no sound, select AirPods)](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*lkDI9yIkdo1X-FmqAftxpA.jpeg)

Top Left "" -> "System Preferences" -> "Bluetooth" (If there's no sound, select AirPods)

You can choose the double-tap actions for the left and right earbuds.

**The click area is located just below the small hole on the side of the earbud:**

![I actually had to feel around to find the location](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*Mm_AMBVgSu6KhflqIOkNGg@2x.jpeg)

I actually had to feel around to find the location.
#### Some Tips

**Quickly Switch Back to iPhone:**

![Pull down the menu -> Select the audio block -> Select the upper right icon -> Switch to AirPods](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*WAp5lJK3JPqsKEY6tX840g.jpeg)

Pull down the menu -> Select the audio block -> Select the upper right icon -> Switch to AirPods

You can also check the battery level of the AirPods here (it shows the battery level of the one with lower charge).

**Using a Widget to Check Battery Level:**

![Swipe left to Control Center -> Tap "Edit" at the bottom -> Find "Batteries" to add and sort](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*CvQhTsxObgHlso2DfbQLTg.jpeg)

Swipe left to Control Center -> Tap "Edit" at the bottom -> Find "Batteries" to add and sort

From now on, you can directly swipe left to the Control Center to check the battery level of the AirPods (it shows the battery level of the one with lower charge). To check the battery levels of both earbuds and the case, you need to put one AirPod back in the case and open the case (since the case itself doesn't have Bluetooth functionality):

![\*The inside of the case has a dust sticker I applied](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*qoUfpf1Jh_jVrHN_l3QRew.jpeg)

> There is a bug here; if your battery widget shows the battery level and then disappears, go to "Settings" -> "Display & Brightness" -> "Text Size" -> and reset it to the default size (the third option) to fix it!

**Checking Battery Level on Apple Watch:**

![Swipe up to Control Center -> Tap on Battery](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*A7ZVJoLehIN14J0LM5Y3qA.jpeg)

Swipe up to Control Center -> Tap on Battery

The battery display on the Apple Watch will also show the battery level of the AirPods below it.

_p\.s\. But there seems to be a bug where it sometimes doesn't display._

#### Additional Information on Battery:

> 1\. When the AirPods battery is low, you will hear a notification sound in one or both AirPods. When the battery is low, you will hear a notification sound once, and just before the AirPods turn off, you will hear it again.

> 2\. If the AirPods are in the charging case with the lid open, the indicator light shows the charging status of the AirPods. If the AirPods are not in the charging case, the indicator light shows the status of the charging case. Green means fully charged, while amber means there is less than one full charge left.

### Experience Review

![](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*vlDbOyPlOGtttbTXf-Q_IA.jpeg)

Before sharing my thoughts, let me mention a recent entrepreneurial story I heard; in short, it goes: "When making a product, we should not target a broad audience, but rather choose a small niche and then gradually expand."

The biggest difference between AirPods and other brands of Bluetooth headphones is the attention to small details in the user experience. For example, when you take one earbud out, the music automatically pauses, and when you put it back in, it resumes playing. You can take them out and use them immediately, and when you're done, just put them back without worrying about turning them on or off or connecting them. In terms of comfort, you can hardly feel their presence when wearing them.

The charging speed is incredibly fast, and they automatically charge when placed in the case; so you just need to keep an eye on whether the case has battery left (the case can charge about five times). You won't encounter situations like before when you wanted to use Bluetooth headphones, but they were out of battery and you had to wait for them to charge.

As for latency, it is as rumored; when watching videos or playing games, I hardly noticed any delay (I tested it with a racing game).

**The Hey Siri feature** initially seemed a bit unnecessary to me since I could also use Hey Siri from my watch at a distance; however, after experiencing it, as mentioned earlier, it’s all about the "details." The Hey Siri feature on AirPods takes it to another level—you don't even need to raise your hand to activate it; just calling out Hey Siri works, truly achieving the feeling of Siri being omnipresent. 

One possible scenario is when you're doing housework and both hands are occupied; at that moment, this feature is incredibly convenient! Plus, you can **call Siri to adjust the volume**: "Hey Siri! Turn it up," "Hey Siri! Set the volume to 75%."

To sum up my experience using AirPods in one sentence:

> "Everything feels so natural."

You don't need to spend energy on unnecessary things; headphones should just be headphones.

**As for call quality**, it is equally impressive. Besides stable basic call quality, the pickup quality rivals that of a microphone—it's truly amazing. When I tested it with a friend, he could hardly tell I was using AirPods!

**Regarding wearing them while riding a bike**, I was actually looking forward to using them for navigation while biking. However, friends who had the first generation told me, "No way," as more than three-quarters of a helmet would press against the ears, causing the earbuds to easily fall out. I tested this myself and felt a bit anxious; I recommend that if you really want to listen to navigation while biking, just wear one earbud, as it's safer to focus on one ear when putting on and taking off the helmet.

#### **Cons:**

Finally, I have to mention the drawbacks I noticed.

The gestures for controlling functions are too limited... I'm really used to controlling the volume with gestures (but fortunately, I can control Spotify's volume with my watch).

Additionally, while the connection speed to the phone is indeed very fast, the connection speed to my MacBook Pro 2018 is quite slow; however, another Mac Mini connects just as quickly as the phone.

The TESTV review channel also mentioned that when using the MacBook Pro with the lid closed and connected to an external display, the signal with AirPods would be intermittent! (I can't comment on this part.)

---
However, why are there these differences? I guess it's due to other signal interference (lights, screen outputs, other Bluetooth devices)?

#### Debunking Myths:
1. Size and shape are the same as wired earpods, and they easily fall out:
   First, the size and shape differ from earpods; I find the earpods a bit loose, but the AirPods feel very secure and don't fall out even when jumping around. However, it really depends on the person; some may indeed experience fit issues. I recommend borrowing a pair from a friend who has AirPods to try them on before purchasing!
   [_\*Or you can stick some artificial skin on the earbud tips to increase surface area and resistance_](https://applealmond.com/posts/35916){:target="_blank"}

2. Sound quality is very similar to earpods: As mentioned, there's actually a significant difference; the sound quality of AirPods is much better. I feel that while there may be a gap compared to headphones in the same price range that focus on sound quality, AirPods are not primarily sound-oriented headphones, so it’s a matter of personal choice. From my personal experience, the sound quality has noticeable surround layers and a wide sound range, overall maintaining a good standard!

### Accessories:

Since I have slippery hands, AirPods feel like an egg to me, and I'm very afraid of dropping them and breaking them. I searched through many recommendations for protective cases, and a lot of people recommended this one: Catalyst AirPods Waterproof Storage Case \(Protective Case\).

The reasons for choosing this are: waterproof, drop-resistant, has a hook, and is convenient to use (you don’t have to take it apart to access the earbuds or charge).

Price: Around $1000

_p\.s\. To get my AirPods ready for immediate use, I actually bought the case before the AirPods 😂_

**User Question: Can the protective cases for the 1st and 2nd generation be shared?**

The distinction is not between the 1st or 2nd generation, but rather between wired and wireless versions; if you have the wired version, both the 1st and 2nd generations will fit. The wireless version has the indicator light on the outside and the pairing button positioned more centered on the back, which cannot share the protective case with the wired version, so please take note ⚠️

#### Next is the dust-proof sticker inside the case:

![AHA AirPods Dust-proof Sticker](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*mgL_FMaH5So-U0iAGJsVFg.jpeg)

AHA AirPods Dust-proof Sticker

**Some users asked about the fit:**

If not applied well, it may not fit perfectly; it took me a long time to get it to fit completely. The edges feel slightly rough (but it doesn't affect functionality, maybe it's just tolerance?).

It's a bit tricky to apply because the dust-proof sticker is a metal piece, and the case itself has magnets that can easily pull it away while aiming.

Currently, I feel it's somewhat unnecessary; I don't know how effective it will be after some time, so I’m keeping a reserved attitude for now.

### Fraud Prevention Awareness

Please be especially cautious; counterfeit versions with cracked chips have already appeared across the strait, pairing with the same animations and battery displays, making it almost impossible to distinguish from the genuine ones.

The main identification methods currently focus on software:
1. Battery display: Genuine ones can show battery levels for the left ear, right ear, and case / counterfeit only shows one.
2. In Bluetooth settings, genuine ones can set click functions for the left and right ears / counterfeit only has disconnect and forget options.
3. The charging case indicator light on genuine ones will turn off after connecting / counterfeit will remain lit.

However, it’s uncertain whether counterfeit versions will fix these issues in the future, so it’s safer to purchase from official or large retail channels.

### ⚠️ Unethical merchants are now more rampant, selling counterfeits at prices close to genuine ones ⚠

Recently, I discovered unscrupulous merchants on Facebook and Google Ads networks selling counterfeits at prices close to genuine ones \(the website is a common [one-page scam site](https://www.facebook.com/ecotcpd/posts/%E5%85%AD%E5%A4%A7%E7%89%B9%E5%BE%B5%E7%A0%B4%E8%A7%A3%E4%B8%80%E9%A0%81%E5%BC%8F%E5%BB%A3%E5%91%8A%E8%A9%90%E9%A8%99%E8%BF%91%E6%9C%9F%E8%87%87%E6%9B%B8line%E5%8F%8A%E5%90%84%E5%A4%A7%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF%E5%B9%B3%E8%87%BA%E4%B8%8A%E5%87%BA%E7%8F%BE%E8%A8%B1%E5%A4%9A%E4%B8%80%E9%A0%81%E5%BC%8F%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF%E8%B3%BC%E7%89%A9%E5%BB%A3%E5%91%8A%E5%9B%A0%E7%82%BA%E5%95%86%E5%93%81%E5%83%B9%E6%A0%BC%E6%AF%94%E5%B8%82%E5%83%B9%E4%BD%8E%E4%BA%86%E5%A5%BD%E5%B9%BE%E5%80%8D%E8%A8%B1%E5%A4%9A%E7%B6%B2%E8%B3%BC%E6%97%8F%E5%9B%A0%E8%80%8C%E4%B8%8B%E6%A8%99%E8%B3%BC%E8%B2%B7%E6%94%B6%E5%88%B0%E8%B2%A8%E5%93%81%E5%BE%8C%E6%89%8D%E7%99%BC%E7%8F%BE%E8%88%87%E7%B6%B2%E9%A0%81%E6%89%80%E5%88%8A/1986377751611350/){:target="_blank"}), which is very malicious; I think if you are trying to save a little money and spend around $1000 to buy AirPods, you should also be aware that it might be fake, but selling counterfeits at genuine prices is truly low-class!

> _Please note, the price of a brand new AirPods should not be less than $4500._
