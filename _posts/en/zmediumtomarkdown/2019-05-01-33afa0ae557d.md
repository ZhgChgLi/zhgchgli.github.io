### AirPods 2 Unboxing and Hands-On Experience \(Laser Engraved Edition\)
#### More clever, incredibly amazing.

#### [\[Latest\] Apple Watch Series 6 Unboxing & Two-Year Experience Review &gt;&gt;&gt; Click here](../eab0e984043/)

When AirPods first came out, I didn't pay much attention; at first glance, they looked like a wireless Bluetooth headset resembling a showerhead. At that time, the wireless Bluetooth headset market was bustling with options, and you could find products that matched any style or need, plus the prices weren't friendly. What was so special about them?

It wasn't until I actually got my hands on them that I felt their **"wow factor."** Since their release, AirPods have consistently topped the Bluetooth headset sales charts, and it's not just due to Apple fans' loyalty. So what makes them so good? Let's continue to explore.

### Background of Purchase

Originally, I was just a simple iPhone user. Last year, I got a MacBook Pro and an [Apple Watch S4](../a2920e33e73e/), and I started to get immersed in the Apple ecosystem (commonly known as the "Apple Family Bundle"). I had bought a watch, but I was still missing a pair of headphones.

The Bluetooth headset I was using had been in service for a while; it was a standard headset—nothing bad, but nothing particularly outstanding either. The sound quality was mediocre, and the battery life was sufficient. If I had to point out a downside, it was that the call quality was unclear, the signal was easily interfered with, and it required a long press to turn on and off, with unclear pairing and battery indicators. These were all minor issues. I mainly used it for commuting and exercising, and at my computer, I mostly used speakers or wired headphones, so it met my basic needs.

After the release of AirPods 1, most of my friends had positive experiences with them. This time, I decided to jump on the trend with AirPods 2.

_p\.s\. Since I never used the 1st generation, my considerations for purchasing weren't based on comparisons with the 1st generation (this article will not mention differences with the 1st generation)._
### Choosing Between Wireless and Wired Versions

The price difference between the wireless and wired versions is $1,200. Initially, I was considering buying the wireless version; I thought about the tangled charging cables on my messy nightstand and how I could avoid bringing an extra cable when traveling. The convenience was very tempting!

After Apple announced that AirPower was dead, I searched online for similar products and bought a 2-in-1 wireless charging version that could charge both my iPhone and Apple Watch. Since my iPhone and AirPods don't usually need charging at the same time, I could use them interchangeably.

Everything seemed great until I received the product and found that I couldn't charge my phone and watch simultaneously. The watch's charging was almost zero, and the speed was very slow; the current just couldn't keep up! Even using a 5.1V/2.1A adapter didn't help. I checked [user reviews](https://www.facebook.com/gusha.tw/posts/1219673421523621?comment_id=1255505397940423){:target="_blank"}, and this issue wasn't unique. In the end, I reluctantly returned it.

I thought about it and realized I only needed two cables (both AirPods and iPhone use Lightning, while Apple Watch uses a dedicated cable), and wired charging is faster. Wireless charging would require a specific version and possibly a larger adapter. Compared to that, there was no significant convenience advantage.

**So ultimately, I chose the wired version of AirPods 2.**

> p\.s\. The only difference between the wireless and wired versions is that the wired version's charging case is the same as the 1st generation (including the indicator light); the wireless version's charging case has the indicator light on the outside and can also be charged via wired connection.

### Placing the Order

From the announcement to the sale (in Taiwan), it took about a month. I checked the official website daily to see if they were available, and I'm sure many others did too XD; the wait was agonizing, especially since other countries had already started selling them!

On April 23, when they went on sale, I immediately placed my order. This time, AirPods 2 could be laser engraved, so of course, I had to get it engraved:

> “One day you’ll leave this world behind So live a life you will remember.” [Avicii — The Nights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtF6Jej8yb4){:target="_blank"}

You can engrave **11 characters**, including Chinese/English/symbols/spaces; in practice, most symbols can be used, and unsupported characters will show "Unable to engrave these characters," so there's no need to worry about garbled text.

_p\.s\. Engraving takes about an extra week; if you don't want engraving, you can buy directly at 101 or through a distributor (which is cheaper)._

The estimated delivery time given by the official site was: 5/3~5/10. On April 29, I was notified that it shipped from Shanghai, and luckily, I received it on April 30, just before the May Day holiday (super fast!! From Shanghai to Taipei).

### Unboxing!

The unboxing is complete! Overall, it feels substantial, and the hand feel and quality are excellent; the engraving is also very fine—it's the standard you would expect from an Apple product!
### Usage
#### First Use:

![](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*GdIZpl46uQiX50zIkoLSjw.jpeg)

To use the brand new AirPods for the first time, simply open the AirPods case near your iPhone, and it will prompt you to pair them; there's no need to press a pairing button.
#### Setting Up Headphone Controls:

**Mobile Version:**

![Open "Settings" -> "Bluetooth" -> "Find Your AirPods" -> "Settings"](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*Aktq6bFF9dDTfWXxrUSQTA.jpeg)

Open "Settings" -> "Bluetooth" -> "Find Your AirPods" -> "Settings"

**MacBook Version:**

![Top Left "" -> "System Preferences" -> "Bluetooth" (If there's no sound, select AirPods)](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*lkDI9yIkdo1X-FmqAftxpA.jpeg)

Top Left "" -> "System Preferences" -> "Bluetooth" (If there's no sound, select AirPods)

You can choose the double-tap actions for each ear.

**The click area is just below the small hole on the side of the headphone body:**

#### Some Tips

**Quickly Switch Back to iPhone:**

![Pull down the menu -> Select the audio block -> Click the upper right icon -> Switch to AirPods](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*WAp5lJK3JPqsKEY6tX840g.jpeg)

Pull down the menu -> Select the audio block -> Click the upper right icon -> Switch to AirPods

You can also check the AirPods battery level here (it shows the battery level of the one with lower charge).

**Using a Widget to Check Battery Level:**

![Swipe left to Control Center -> Tap "Edit" at the bottom -> Find "Batteries" to add and arrange](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*CvQhTsxObgHlso2DfbQLTg.jpeg)

Swipe left to Control Center -> Tap "Edit" at the bottom -> Find "Batteries" to add and arrange

From now on, you can directly swipe left to the Control Center to check the AirPods battery level (it shows the battery level of the one with lower charge). To check the battery levels of both ears and the case, you need to put one AirPod back in the case and open the case (since the case itself doesn't have Bluetooth functionality):

![\*The inside of the case has my dust-proof sticker](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*qoUfpf1Jh_jVrHN_l3QRew.jpeg)

\*The inside of the case has my dust-proof sticker

> There is a bug here; if your battery widget shows the level and then disappears, go to "Settings" -> "Display & Brightness" -> "Text Size" -> Set it back to the default size (the third option) to fix it!

**Checking Battery Level on Apple Watch:**

![Swipe up to Control Center -> Tap on Battery](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*A7ZVJoLehIN14J0LM5Y3qA.jpeg)

Swipe up to Control Center -> Tap on Battery

The battery display on the Apple Watch will also show the AirPods battery level below it.

_p\.s\. But there seems to be a bug; sometimes it doesn't display._
#### Additional Information on Battery:

> 1\. When the AirPods battery is low, you will hear a chime in one or both AirPods. When the battery is low, you will hear a chime once, and before the AirPods turn off, you will hear another chime.

> 2\. If the AirPods are in the charging case with the lid open, the indicator light shows the charging status of the AirPods. If the AirPods are not in the charging case, the indicator light shows the status of the charging case. Green means fully charged, while amber means there is less than one full charge left.

### Experience Review

![](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*vlDbOyPlOGtttbTXf-Q_IA.jpeg)

Before sharing my thoughts, I want to mention a recent entrepreneurial story I heard; in short, it goes: "When making a product, we should not target a broad audience but rather choose a specific niche and then gradually expand."

The biggest difference between AirPods and other brands of Bluetooth headsets is the attention to small details in the user experience. For example, when you take one out, the music automatically pauses, and when you put it back in, it resumes playback. You can take them out and use them immediately without worrying about turning them on or off or connecting them. In terms of comfort, you can hardly feel their presence when wearing them.

The charging speed is incredibly fast, and they automatically charge when placed in the case. So you only need to keep an eye on whether the case has power (the case can charge about five times), and you won't encounter situations where you need to use the Bluetooth headset, but it's out of battery and you have to wait for it to charge.

As for latency, it is as rumored; when watching videos or playing games, I hardly noticed any delay (I tested it while playing a racing game).

**Regarding Hey Siri**, I initially thought it was a gimmick since I could also use Hey Siri from my watch at a distance. However, after experiencing it, as mentioned above, it all comes down to "detail experience." The Hey Siri feature on AirPods takes it to another level; you don't even need to raise your hand to activate it; just call out Hey Siri, and it works, truly achieving the feeling of Siri being omnipresent. A possible scenario is when you're tidying up the house and have both hands full; at that moment, this feature is incredibly convenient! Plus, you can **call Siri to adjust the volume**: "Hey Siri! Turn it up," "Hey Siri! Set the volume to 75%."

To sum up my experience using AirPods:

> "Everything feels so natural."

You don't need to spend time worrying about unnecessary things; headphones should just be headphones.

**The call quality** is equally impressive; in addition to stable basic call quality, the sound pickup is comparable to that of a microphone, which is truly amazing. During a test call with a friend, he could hardly tell I was using AirPods!

**Regarding wearing them while riding a bike**, I was initially excited about using them for navigation while biking. However, friends who already had the 1st generation warned me that it wouldn't work; with more than 3/4 of a helmet, the process of putting on the helmet would press against the ears, causing the headphones to easily fall out. I tested this myself and felt a bit nervous; I recommend that if you really want to use them for navigation while biking, just wear one earbud, as it's safer to focus on one ear when putting on and taking off the helmet.
#### **Cons:**

Finally, I have to mention the drawbacks I see.

The gesture controls are too limited... I'm really used to controlling the volume with gestures (but thankfully, I can control Spotify's volume with my watch).

Additionally, while the connection speed to the phone is indeed very fast, the connection speed to my MacBook Pro 2018 is quite slow, although another Mac Mini connects as quickly as the phone.

The TESTV review channel also mentioned that when using the MacBook Pro with the lid closed and connected to an external display, the signal with AirPods would be intermittent! (I haven't experienced this myself).

不過，為什麼會有這些差異呢？我猜是因為有其他信號干擾（燈光、螢幕輸出、其他藍牙設備）吧？

#### 闢謠：
1. 大小外型跟有線earpods一樣、容易掉的問題：
首先，大小外型跟earpods有差距，我戴earpods的時候有點鬆鬆的，但戴AirPods感覺很穩，跳來跳去也不會掉；不過其實很看人，有的人確實會出現不合適的問題，建議購買前先跟有AirPods的朋友借來戴戴看！
[_\*或是在耳機頭部貼一些人工皮增加面積、阻力_](https://applealmond.com/posts/35916){:target="_blank"}
2. 音質跟earpods很像：同上，其實差很多，AirPods的音質好很多；我覺得雖然可能跟同價位主打音質的耳機有落差，也沒有降噪功能，但AirPods本身就不是音質取向的耳機，取捨就看個人。
就我個人體驗，音質聽得出環繞層次、音域廣，整體不失水準！

### 配件：

由於我手滑，AirPods就像一顆雞蛋一樣，我很怕會滑手直接摔壞；爬了許多保護套推薦文，蠻多人推薦這款：Catalyst AirPods 防水收納盒\(保護套\)

會選擇這個的原因是：防水、防摔、有掛勾、使用便利（拿收耳機跟充電時不用拆）

價格：$1000上下

_p\.s\. 為了要拿到AirPods能馬上用，其實我套子比AirPods先買好😂_

**網友提問：1代與2代保護套是否能共用？**

區分這個的標準不是1或2代，而是有線或無線版；如果您是有線版，那1、2代都能用，無線版的指示燈在外及背面配對設定按鍵位置較上居中，無法與有線版共用保護套，這部分需要注意⚠️

#### 再來是盒子內部防塵貼：

![AHA AirPods 防塵貼](/assets/33afa0ae557d/1*mgL_FMaH5So-U0iAGJsVFg.jpeg)

AHA AirPods 防塵貼

**有網友問到密合度問題：**

沒貼好會有點不密合，我花了很久才讓它完全密合；邊邊稍微有一點點刮手感（不影響，可能是公差？）

不太好貼，因為防塵貼是金屬片，盒子本身有磁鐵，容易在瞄準的時候就被吸下去。

目前覺得有點多餘，不知道使用一陣子後的效果如何，所以先持保留態度。

### 防詐騙宣導

請大家要特別注意，對岸已經出現破解晶片的高仿版本，配對同樣有動畫、同樣有電量顯示，從外觀幾乎無法區別的山寨版。

目前主要的識別方式是從軟體下手：
1. 電量顯示：正版能顯示左耳、右耳、盒子三個電量/盜版只有一個
2. 藍牙設定那邊，正版可以設定左右耳的點擊功能/盜版只有斷開和遺忘
3. 充電盒指示燈，正版連上後會熄/盜版會繼續亮著

但以上都不確定之後山寨版會不會修正，所以大家還是以官方或大型通路渠道購買較安全。

### ⚠️不孝商人現在更猖獗了，把盜版用接近正版的價格賣⚠

日前在Facebook、Google廣告聯播網上發現有惡劣商人，將盜版用接近正版價格賣\(網站是常見的 [一頁式詐騙網頁](https://www.facebook.com/ecotcpd/posts/%E5%85%AD%E5%A4%A7%E7%89%B9%E5%BE%B5%E7%A0%B4%E8%A7%A3%E4%B8%80%E9%A0%81%E5%BC%8F%E5%BB%A3%E5%91%8A%E8%A9%90%E9%A8%99%E8%BF%91%E6%9C%9F%E8%87%89%E6%9B%B8line%E5%8F%8A%E5%90%84%E5%A4%A7%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF%E5%B9%B3%E8%87%BA4%E8%8B%B1%E5%9B%A0%E7%82%BA%E5%95%86%E5%93%81%E5%83%B9%E6%A0%BC%E6%AF%94%E5%B8%82%E5%83%B9%E4%BD%8E%E4%BA%86%E5%A5%BD%E5%B9%BE%E5%80%8D%E8%A8%B1%E5%A4%9A%E7%B6%B2%E8%B3%BC%E6%97%8F%E5%9B%A0%E8%80%8C%E4%B8%8B%E6%A8%99%E8%B3%BC%E8%B2%B7%E6%94%B6%E5%88%B0%E8%B2%A8%E5%93%81%E5%BE%8C%E6%89%8D%E7%99%BC%E7%8F%BE%E8%88%87%E7%B6%B2%E9%A0%81%E6%89%80%E5%88%8A/1986377751611350/){:target="_blank"} \)，非常惡劣；我覺得如果你是貪小便宜花個1000買到AirPods，你自己應該也要有認知會是假的，但把盜版當正版價格賣實在非常低級！
