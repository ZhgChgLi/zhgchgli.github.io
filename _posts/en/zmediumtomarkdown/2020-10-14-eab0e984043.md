### Apple Watch Series 6 Unboxing & Two-Year Experience

Apple Watch Series 6 unboxing and purchasing guide & summary of two-year experience

### Introduction

Time flies, and it has already been two years since [the previous unboxing article for Apple Watch Series 4](../a2920e33e73e/); in terms of functionality, Series 4 is more than sufficient and does not require an upgrade. Series 5/Series 6 do not have any core breakthrough features; they are updates that are nice to have but not essential.

However, due to [the news about Xiao Gui](https://tw.appledaily.com/gadget/20200917/WPQMTKQVPFFUPH6LE3R7SEXYAQ/){:target="_blank"}, I fortunately let my family use the original Series 4 LTE version; the LTE version can make emergency calls without being restricted by whether the phone is nearby, making it safer compared to the GPS version.

My personal usage habit is to wear it when going out and take it off to charge when I get home; I do not wear it while sleeping, so I miss out on the sleep tracking experience.

I bought the LTE version of Series 4, but since I always carry my phone with me, it is really unnecessary to pay an extra $199 monthly fee for activation. Moreover, replying to messages on the watch is cumbersome, and answering calls is only convenient with AirPods. Additionally, the Spotify app on the watch is purely a playback controller and cannot play independently without the iPhone (only Apple Music/KKBOX can).

> _and… I am an [iOS APP](http://zhgchg.li){:target="_blank"} / [watchOS APP developer](../e85d77b05061/)_

**\[2020–10–24 Update\]**: Spotify now supports independent playback. In the watch's Spotify app, select playback device -> Apple Watch -> connect Bluetooth headphones -> and you can play! (It still does not support offline playback and requires an internet connection to use).

### Apple Watch Series 6 Unboxing

Let's get straight to the main event.
#### Order Placement

This time, I chose the GPS 44mm aluminum version in Cypress Green (military green), matching my iPhone 11 Pro in military green.

I did not catch the first batch for purchase; I **placed my order on 9/15 evening:**
- The system estimated the delivery time as 10/16~10/19 (possibly coinciding with the National Day holiday in China).
- On 10/10, I received a notification that it had shipped, with an estimated arrival before 10/13.
- On 10/13, I was notified that the delivery date might be slightly delayed due to customs.
- I actually received it on 10/14, but it was still earlier than the original estimated delivery time!

When combining, you can first install the upper part of the strap, then pull off the paper protective cover, which makes it less likely to slip from your hands.

It's great that the screen won't turn off now; you don't have to raise your wrist and wait for the screen to light up to check messages!

### Two Years of User Experience Summary

Let's summarize my feelings and my own purchasing guide from these two years of use.
#### Enhancing Life Experience and Increasing Focus

The Apple Watch serves as an extension of the phone, acting as a buffer between the phone and the user; our current reliance on electronic products means facing the phone and the constant barrage of notifications.

I wonder if you feel the same way I do about phone notifications being quite alarming; even the sound of vibrations can be startling. Sometimes, when I receive a notification, my heart skips a beat; then I instinctively take out my phone to check. I handle important matters and put away my phone for unimportant ones; this process repeats daily in life...

While you can certainly turn off sound notifications, disable vibrations in silent mode, or even turn off all notification features, you also disconnect from the world and miss out on truly important notifications, resulting in a different kind of anxiety where you constantly check your phone.

Given the above situation, the Apple Watch can act as a lubricant, adding a funnel for filtering between the user and the phone. When wearing the watch and the phone is asleep, only the watch will notify you. You can set specific app notifications to be sent to the watch and mute specific app notification sounds/vibrations.

You might say, aren't these settings the same as on the phone? But in terms of experience, the watch's sounds/vibrations are gentler and less intrusive. Even if you turn off sounds/vibrations, you can quickly check for notifications by raising your wrist.

The enhancement of daily experience and the way to increase focus is by quickly reviewing notifications on the watch, then deciding whether to continue with the current task or take out the phone to handle the message content. The interruption time is very short (just the time to look at the watch), and it also avoids the distraction of constantly taking out the phone, increasing work efficiency.
#### Healthy Living and Exercise Tracking

![Exercise Tracking](/assets/eab0e984043/1*-DI6bScq4rexoxItcy1jwA.jpeg)

With the exclusive "Fitness" app that can only be used with the Apple Watch, you can record your daily activities, including daily activity levels, walking, heart rate, and exercise records, along with statistics on activity level changes and more detailed health information. In terms of community, you can also compete with friends on activity levels and unlock badges, increasing motivation for exercise.

However, exercise is very personal; those who exercise will continue to do so, and those who don't won't start exercising just because of the watch. It mainly adds to the recording and fun of exercising.
#### Apple Pay

You can make payments by double-clicking the watch without even taking out your phone, which is very convenient, especially when you have your hands full and don't have an extra hand to dig your phone out of your pocket. Additionally, you can install invoice apps that support Apple Watch, open the app to display the barcode for the cashier to scan, and then double-click to bring up Apple Pay for payment.

My most common usage habit is to use the phone widget to let the cashier scan the barcode for the carrier or membership (like 7-Eleven/FamilyMart, as they don't provide an Apple Watch app), and then quickly double-click the watch to bring up Apple Pay, allowing for payment with the same hand.

> _Store it inside, no receipt needed._ 

#### Personal Style Combinations

The watch face and strap can be changed at any time according to your mood; I have a few fixed watch faces, some for work and some for leisure; over the past two years, I've bought four straps… some are leather, some are metal, some are woven, and there are color-changing protective cases… to match my outfits.

#### Apple Ecosystem Integration
1. The watch can directly unlock your Mac computer.
2. The watch can find your phone with one click (forcing the phone to emit a beeping sound).
3. The watch can serve as a Bluetooth shutter button to control the phone's camera.

#### Check the Weather

I am very accustomed to checking the current weather conditions and the chance of rain on my watch; it's clear at a glance. I have to click through several layers on my phone to see the information I want.

#### Alarms and Timers

The countdown timer and alarm are also features I love to use. I can quickly activate the countdown timer on the watch, and when the timer or alarm goes off while wearing the watch, it will notify me through the watch (if the watch is on silent, it will vibrate to remind me).

I find it very comfortable, especially when I want to take a short break and worry that the alarm sound or phone vibration might disturb my colleagues.

#### Maps

It's quite useful when riding a motorcycle, as I can **directly view route maps** and receive vibration prompts for routes/turns; however, the downside is that the maps are not optimized for motorcycles, so I need to **be aware of motorcycle prohibited routes**, and the route planning capability is average.

![View route map on the watch](/assets/eab0e984043/1*vSQpbnXNtR_OoC6-ygp0sw.jpeg)

View route map on the watch

Google Maps recently returned to the Apple Watch, but it cannot directly view route maps, only providing text navigation prompts.

#### Fall Detection

Since everyone has been paying attention to this feature recently, I wanted to share my personal experience with triggering it; once, when getting into a car, I quickly and forcefully kicked the seat with my left hand, successfully triggering the fall detection. The watch will first vibrate and make sounds to call your attention, checking if you are conscious. If you do not respond, it will call emergency services and notify your designated emergency contacts after 30 seconds.

[Apple Watch Fall Detection Test, calling 119 for rescue in 1 minute.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU3MlNCjCbY){:target="_blank"}

> _\- Before watchOS 5, fall detection was enabled by default only for those over 65 years old; for those under 65, it was disabled by default; this part can be checked in the settings._ 

> _\- Multiple emergency contacts can be designated, but they need to be set up in advance._ 

#### Recommended Apps to Install

For those who have seen [the previous unboxing article](../a2920e33e73e/), that article included unboxing, usage tutorials, and some app recommendations; to be honest, I later deleted most of them, keeping only the built-in apps and some commonly used communication software; because initially, I was curious and installed a bunch of apps, but later I didn't use them.

To be frank, when complex operations are needed, you will use your phone; the watch really only needs to be quick.

### Development of the Apple Watch in the Past Two Years

As mentioned earlier, there have been no changes in functionality or product positioning between Series 4 and Series 6; they are both extensions of the iPhone and are not meant to replace it. There have been no groundbreaking features in the past two years, and the battery life is still one charge per day.

In terms of third-party apps, there haven't been many new additions in the past two years, but there is an increasing trend; Line and Google Maps have recently updated and strengthened their Apple Watch app components, showing they have not been forgotten.

I previously wrote an article sharing my experience of [making my own Apple Watch app](../e85d77b05061/), based on watchOS 5 development, and found that the features officially opened up are very limited (which is still about the same now), so the space for third-party development is limited, resulting in very few apps.

#### watchOS

It has now been updated to watchOS 7, with annual updates like iOS.

**watchOS 6:** Added environmental noise detection, menstrual tracking (suitable for female friends), and internet walkie-talkie.

**watchOS 7:** Added sleep tracking functionality, handwashing time assistance prompts, and family sharing features.

#### watchOS 7 [Family Sharing Feature](https://www.apple.com/tw/newsroom/2020/09/apple-extends-the-apple-watch-experience-to-the-entire-family/){:target="_blank"} (limited to LTE version)

I have actually experienced this feature by giving my original Series 4 watch to a family member; you can [refer to this unboxing video](https://youtu.be/DMXGSGJDc8c?t=509){:target="_blank"} for more details; this feature ties the watch to your phone, and the watch must be nearby to change settings. After the setup process is completed, some settings cannot be adjusted again and must be reset; the shared family members can only use it and cannot customize it themselves.

The benefit is that the wearer does not necessarily have to be an iPhone user!

> _According to [official website information](https://support.apple.com/zh-tw/HT211768){:target="_blank"}, this feature is only available for LTE-equipped Series 4 and later models!_

### Purchasing Guide
#### Should You Buy It?

I think most of the friends who see this are already 80% inclined to buy it; I believe if you are a tech enthusiast, it's worth buying to play with. If a watch is just an accessory for you, you can find prettier options at the same price. If you're buying it solely for sports, there are better sports watches to consider. The Apple Watch is designed for comprehensive needs and enhanced experiences.
1. The case of the little ghost is something that even the Apple Watch cannot avoid.
Because the little ghost fell after taking a shower, the Apple Watch **is water-resistant but not steam-resistant**. If you often wear the watch while showering, it can easily break. Additionally, since it needs to be charged daily, it is usually taken off during showers for charging, so it won't be worn.
2. It is still just an extension of the phone, an experimental product from Apple.
3. Needs to be charged daily, and you have to bring a charger when going out.
4. When switching from Series 4 to Series 6, I didn't wear it for two to three weeks in between, and personally, I felt it didn't make much difference.

#### Series 6 or SE or Second-Hand Series 4/5?

In terms of performance, they are all sufficient to last another 3 to 5 years. If you have the budget, of course, buy new instead of old. If you are looking for value for money, you can buy the SE. If your budget is limited, you can buy a second-hand Series 4/5/LTE version, which is easier to obtain.

> _The Apple Watch can only be paired with an iPhone ( **Android phones and iPads cannot** ). Additionally, consider the current iOS version of your phone, **watchOS 7 is only compatible with iOS ≥ 14 devices**_ ( _watchOS 6 =&gt; iOS ≥ 13/watchOS 5 =&gt; iOS ≥ 12)_ 

> _The iPhone must be upgraded to the corresponding minimum iOS version to pair and use._ 

Series 6 / SE does not come with a tofu charging head.

The [Family Sharing feature](https://www.apple.com/tw/newsroom/2020/09/apple-extends-the-apple-watch-experience-to-the-entire-family/){:target="_blank"} of watchOS 7 (which allows you to check children's location status and elderly health conditions) **is only available for Series 4 and above or SE versions**.
#### Aluminum Alloy or Stainless Steel or Titanium?

![Stainless Steel Version (Thanks to my colleague for the support)](/assets/eab0e984043/1*mAGXLi2ant1ycZAjJxkdUQ.jpeg)

Stainless Steel Version (Thanks to my colleague for the support)

It depends on how you position this watch. If it's for novelty and fun, aluminum alloy is fine; if you want to enhance its accessory attributes, then buy the stainless steel version or above, which is more beautiful and better matched.

The aluminum alloy version has a higher demand in the second-hand market, and it's easier to sell when a new generation comes out (my Series 4 can still sell for 7,000 to 8,000).

The aluminum alloy version's body and glass are more fragile, and the screen glass is not scratch-resistant. It is recommended to buy a protective case and a full-screen protector.

Protective case (about $400) + protective film, it is recommended to find a water gel film or jelly film (about $800), otherwise, you may encounter fitting issues; in total, an additional + $1500 can provide complete protection for the aluminum alloy version.

> _Additionally, here’s a lesson learned: if you have a protective film, you must buy a protective case; otherwise, it can easily chip (I had to replace three films because of this, losing nearly $3000). The protective film must be of good quality and fit well; otherwise, it will be difficult to use, and it's a waste of money._ 

![HAO Jelly Gel Full-Screen Glass Protector from Xiaohao](https://assets/eab0e984043/1*_MqU1EPSzArqKUI_Gr5Ttg.jpeg)

HAO Jelly Gel Full-Screen Glass Protector from Xiaohao

Fully transparent & fully adhesive, completely fits, does not affect smooth sliding and display.

![RhinoShield + Protective Film](/assets/eab0e984043/1*kxIs3i4j2frhC5dV_YQXdw.jpeg)

RhinoShield + Protective Film

> _The screen will become slightly thicker, so the inner frame may lift a bit (depending on the tolerance of the protective case), but the clips still fit in._ 

> _Xiaohao's film suggests not to stuff the RhinoShield's inner frame too much, as it may easily press against the protective film; just use the outer frame. However, my Series 4 has been in this state for two years without any issues, so everyone can decide for themselves._ 

#### 40mm or 44mm?

It depends on the thickness of your wrist; generally, men are advised to wear 44mm, as 40mm may look a bit small.

> _If you are buying the aluminum alloy + protective case, consider whether the size with the protective case will be too large._ 

#### GPS or LTE Mobile Network Version?

Considering that I didn't use LTE when I bought it before, I switched to the GPS version this time, saving $3000.

The considerations for GPS or LTE include whether you will have situations where you only wear the watch out, as well as the recent concern about the fall detection feature. **The GPS version only works when the phone is nearby or the watch can connect to the current Wi-Fi network; the watch connects to the phone for emergency alerts** (if these conditions are not met, it will not notify for alerts); the LTE version can operate independently, which is relatively safer; communication between the phone and watch is the same; if the GPS version or LTE is not activated, it communicates through the phone when the watch is nearby, or the watch can connect to the current Wi-Fi network.

> _The watch being able to connect to the current Wi-Fi network means that the phone and watch have previously connected to this Wi-Fi, and the system has a record to connect directly._ 

```markdown
The [Family Sharing feature](https://www.apple.com/tw/newsroom/2020/09/apple-extends-the-apple-watch-experience-to-the-entire-family/){:target="_blank"} of watchOS 7 (which allows you to check the status of children's movements and the health of the elderly) **is only available on the LTE version**, because **the watch's data is sent back to the designated person (parent) rather than the wearer's phone**.
#### Band Section

**The bands are only categorized as:**
- **Large:** 42 (Apple Watch Series 3 and below) / 44 (Apple Watch Series 4 and above)
- **Small:** 38 (Apple Watch Series 3 and below) / 40 (Apple Watch Series 4 and above)

Apple has guaranteed that the band sizes will not change (otherwise, who would buy the Hermès version XD), and at least currently, bands from Series 1 to 6 are interchangeable.

[**Unboxing the Apple Watch Original Stainless Steel Milanese Loop**](../c0f99f987d9c/)
#### Standard / Nike / Hermès Versions

The Nike version only includes a Nike-exclusive watch face, while the Hermès version not only has a Hermès-exclusive watch face but also comes with Hermès bands paired with the stainless steel version.
### Upgrade Guide

If you currently have a Series 3/Series 2/Series 1, it is recommended to upgrade, at least to Series 4; starting from Series 4, the screen becomes full-screen (many new watch faces require Series 4 or above to use), and the processor performance is significantly better, almost eliminating lag, making the upgrade worthwhile.

Series 4 can be upgraded or not, as the main differences are the always-on display and the blood oxygen monitor. The Apple Watch's raise-to-wake feature is fast and responsive, so having an always-on display is certainly better but not essential; the blood oxygen monitor has not passed medical certification and is for reference only.

If you already have a Series 5, you can wait for the next generation, as there is no need to upgrade.

For detailed comparisons, you can refer to the official website's "[Compare All Models](https://www.apple.com/tw/watch/compare/){:target="_blank"}," which also highlights some differences in features, such as altimeter, compass, etc.
