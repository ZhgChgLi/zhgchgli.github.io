### New Additions to Xiaomi Smart Home

Experience with AI speaker, temperature and humidity sensor, weight scale 2, DC inverter fan

### Getting Started

After the previous article "[First Experience with Smart Home — Apple HomeKit & Xiaomi Mijia](../c3150cdc85dd/)" where I introduced how to use Xiaomi smart home; I continued to purchase several Xiaomi home products and tried my best to make all appliances smart... I can only say it's truly a rabbit hole. Initially, I just wanted to buy a desk lamp because I thought Xiaomi's design was beautiful, and while researching the smart features, I fell into the rabbit hole!

### New Purchase — Xiaomi AI Speaker

Price: NT$ 1,495

#### Features:
1. Voice control for all connected Mijia smart devices
2. 3-month KKBOX membership for Taiwan region
3. Powerful voice intelligence; compared to Siri, Siri = 3-year-old child
¶ Xiao Ai not only has basic voice assistant functions (checking weather, news, information, controlling appliances, playing music...)
¶ but also has a plethora of extended skills (asking about American dramas, playing mini-games, chatting, telling jokes, **acting as a maid, yes, it talks to you in a maid's tone!!**)
¶ Supports custom functions (custom words, corresponding actions)
4. Another significant difference is that it can make related suggestions; unlike Siri, which only responds with the weather when asked, Xiao Ai will also ask if you want a reminder to take an umbrella, making it more considerate and warm.
5. 360-degree audio pickup and playback, sufficient volume; very responsive and accurate when called.
6. Can be used directly as a Bluetooth music speaker

#### Drawbacks:
1. **When used as a Bluetooth speaker**, there is a serious delay of 1-2 seconds when watching videos; this is quite a significant flaw, and there seems to be no solution on forums in mainland China, with the official response being lackluster, seemingly a hardware issue.
2. Does not support Spotify / Apple Music; as a non-KKBOX user, after the 3-month trial expires, I have to switch to using QQ Music in mainland China.
3. Unlike HomePod, it does not support home hub functionality. I initially expected to use the Xiaomi speaker as the central hub for my smart home, so that when I arrive home, Mijia would detect the Xiaomi speaker and automatically execute corresponding actions (like Apple HomePod + HomeKit); it seems that's not possible!
4. Requires an additional Xiao Ai speaker app
5. Must set the same region as the Mijia app; I have my Mijia app set to mainland China (for more features), but Xiao Ai can only be set to the mainland.

In summary, under daily use, it is just a Bluetooth speaker that can play music, occasionally reminding me of the time... which Siri can also do; not being able to serve as a Bluetooth speaker for my computer is really painful for me, but I must say its voice functionality is truly intelligent and impressive! It can be fun to play with.

### New Purchase — Mijia Bluetooth Temperature and Humidity Sensor

Small item, NT$ 365

You need to buy an additional AA battery to install; the official claim is a battery life of up to one year. The round, compact design with a magnetic hanging feature makes it easy to take down and play with, and the dual-row display allows for quick grasp of the current temperature and humidity.

APP Temperature Record

It only supports Bluetooth connection, so once the phone is out of Bluetooth range, it cannot read the data; unless you purchase a Bluetooth gateway or other Mijia devices that support Bluetooth gateway functionality.

![Official document's list of supported Bluetooth gateway devices](/assets/bcff7c157941/1*FN1SQKH8fwQq80MDDxv-2Q.png)

Official document's list of supported Bluetooth gateway devices

Generally, devices that can connect to WiFi and Bluetooth are supported, but **the Xiaomi AI speaker surprisingly does not work**!!

Moreover, I discovered something strange, which is that **the Mijia DC inverter fan actually can**, WTF!!!; so currently, I am using the Mijia fan to transmit the temperature and humidity sensor's information via WiFi to the internet for me.

It's really bizarre... the Xiaomi AI speaker, desk lamp, table lamp, and camera do not support Bluetooth gateway functionality, yet the fan does!

> _*Not sure if it's only the temperature and humidity sensor that can do this_

#### Additionally, the temperature and humidity sensor will not continuously send push notifications

It pushes notifications for high temperature or humidity (but these temperature and humidity levels are quite normal in Taiwan...)

**How to Turn Off:**

![You can go to "My" -> top right corner "Settings" -> Device Notifications -> find the Mi Bluetooth Temperature and Humidity Sensor -> turn it off](/assets/bcff7c157941/1*m5_dj0QgEs47J0ozBoNMnQ.jpeg)

You can go to "My" -> top right corner "Settings" -> Device Notifications -> find the Mi Bluetooth Temperature and Humidity Sensor -> turn it off.

After turning it off, you will no longer receive push notification messages!

### New Purchase — Weight Scale 2

It's just a weight scale, NT$ 395

In addition to recording weight in the app, it also has features like weighing objects and balance testing... but it's just a weight scale; the most common use is simply measuring weight. Its beautiful design enhances the aesthetic of your home even when not in use!

You also need to download the Xiaomi Health app separately. Open the app while weighing to sync and record your weight.

### New Purchase — DC Inverter Fan

The most satisfying appliance from this equipment purchase, NT$ 1995

![](/assets/bcff7c157941/1*cMflcYANnC0JR-Os5odoPQ.jpeg)

#### First, the basic functions of the fan

The left and right oscillation range is 120 degrees, and the wind speed adjustment supports 1–100 levels, allowing you to choose the wind strength at will. My favorite feature is the "natural wind" mode, as I tend to feel uncomfortable after direct blowing for a while. This natural wind mode allows me to maintain direct blowing without discomfort!

#### Design

It maintains the simple white design of Xiaomi. Personally, I don't like fans that are too metallic (they feel dirty); the Xiaomi fan is light and clean, and even when not in use, it looks pleasant.

#### Smart Features

After adding it to the Mi Home app, you can control all parameters (mode, switch, wind speed, angle) from the app. Additionally, you can set periodic timers (e.g., turn off at 7:00 AM from Monday to Friday) and link it with other Mi Home devices (e.g., automatically turn on when you come home, automatically turn on when the temperature exceeds 30 degrees)... and other smart home features to explore.

I also discovered that it can act as a Bluetooth gateway, helping to transmit data for the Mi Bluetooth Temperature and Humidity Sensor.

> _*Not sure if only the temperature and humidity sensor can do this._

### Summary

The above is a summary of my experience with the new purchases. There is still a long way to go to achieve my ideal setup (automatically turning on the air conditioning when the temperature is too high, having the fan follow me, turning on the lights when I come home, turning off the lights and turning on the camera when I leave, turning on the dehumidifier when humidity is too high), and the road is quite rugged... I need to learn about electrical circuits, and I also found that my dehumidifier does not have a return function, and the air conditioning is an old model. Many Mi Home devices are not sold in Taiwan (e.g., universal remote control). I initially wanted to rush into a smart home setup, but upon reflection, the utility is not significant. I will continue to research what else can be made smart!
