#### Introduction

In the previous article "[**CI/CD Practical Guide (2): Comprehensive Guide to Using GitHub Actions and Self-hosted Runners**](../404bd5c70040/)", we introduced the basics of GitHub Actions, its workflow, and how to use your own machine as a Runner. We implemented three simple automation Actions together. **This article will focus on the practical use of GitHub Actions to build an iOS App CI/CD workflow**, guiding you step by step while supplementing your knowledge of GitHub Actions.
### App CI/CD Workflow Diagram


![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*VRygfRAkBRNEDAC4RyGzRA.png)


This article will focus on the CI/CD section built with GitHub Actions. The next article "[CI/CD Practical Guide (4): Using Google Apps Script Web App to Connect GitHub Actions for a Free and Easy Packaging Tool Platform](../4273e57e7148/)" will introduce the right half of the diagram, which involves using Google Apps Script Web App to build a cross-team collaboration packaging platform.
#### Workflow Process:
1. GitHub Actions triggers via Pull Request, form submission, or scheduled event
2. Executes corresponding Workflow Jobs/Steps
3. Steps execute corresponding Fastlane (iOS) or (Android Gradle) scripts
4. Fastlane executes corresponding xcodebuild (iOS) commands
5. Obtains execution results
6. Subsequent Workflow Jobs/Steps process results
7. Completion

#### GitHub Actions Results

Let's start with the final results to give you some motivation for implementation!

### Basic Knowledge of GitHub Actions x Self-hosted Runner

If you are not familiar with GitHub Actions and setting up a Self-hosted Runner, I strongly recommend reading the previous article "[**CI/CD Practical Guide (2): Comprehensive Guide to Using GitHub Actions and Self-hosted Runners**](../404bd5c70040/)" or implementing it alongside the knowledge from the previous article.


> **_Let's get started with the implementation!_** 




### Infrastructure Architecture of the iOS Demo Project


[![](https://opengraph.githubassets.com/5952f3220c95ced947b9ee50d9c542b2edbb424be50c51c582cb226ce5f5df63/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo)](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo){:target="_blank"}


**The iOS project content used in this article includes test items generated by AI**, so there is no need to focus on the iOS programming details; we will only discuss the Infra & CI/CD aspects.


> **_The following tools are based on past experience; if it's a new project, consider using the updated [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise){:target="_blank"} and [tuist](https://github.com/tuist/tuist){:target="_blank"}._** 




#### Mint


[![](https://opengraph.githubassets.com/cfba5c7658c860d0ee4e97df8176a3fc6bbfd9f84c2e8334eaa30988c2700d63/yonaskolb/Mint)](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint){:target="_blank"}


The Mint tool helps us manage the versions of dependency tools uniformly (Gemfile can only manage Ruby Gems), such as XCodeGen, SwiftFormat, SwiftLint, Periphery, etc.

**Mintfile:**
```graphql
yonaskolb/Mint@0.17.5
yonaskolb/XcodeGen@2.35.0
nicklockwood/SwiftFormat@0.51.13
```

Here we only use three.


> **_If you find it too complicated, you can skip it and directly install the required tools using brew install in the Action Workflow Step._** 




#### Bundle

**Gemfile:**
```bash
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'cocoapods', '~>1.16.0'
gem 'fastlane', '~>2.228.0'

plugins_path = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'Product', 'fastlane', 'Pluginfile')
eval_gemfile(plugins_path) if File.exist?(plugins_path)
```

This manages Ruby (Gems) related dependencies. The two most commonly used in iOS projects are `cocoapods` and `fastlane`.
#### Cocoapods

**Product/podfile:**
```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo' do
  pod 'SnapKit'
end 
```

Although it has been declared [to be deprecated](https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Specs-Repo/){:target="_blank"}, Cocoapods is still very common in older iOS projects. Here we simply add SnapKit as a demo.
#### XCodeGen

To avoid conflicts caused by changes to `.xcodeproj` / `.xcworkspace` during multi-person development, we use a Project.yaml to define the XCode Project content and generate the project files locally (not pushed to Git).

**Product/project.yaml:**
```yaml
name: app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo
options:
  bundleIdPrefix: com.example
  deploymentTarget:
    iOS: '13.0'
  usesTabs: false
  indentWidth: 2
  tabWidth: 2

  Debug: debug
  Release: release

      settings:
        base:
          PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER: com.test.appcicdgithubactionsdemo.snapshottests

packages:
  SnapshotTesting:
    url: https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing
    from: 1.18.4
```

SnapshotTesting: Managed using Swift Package Manager.
#### Fastlane

Encapsulates the xcodebuild command, as well as the complex steps for connecting to App Store Connect API, Firebase API, and other services.

**Product/fastlane/Fastfile:**
```php

default_platform(:ios)

platform :ios do
  desc "Run all tests (Unit Tests + UI Tests)"
  lane :run_all_tests do |options|
    device = options[:device]
    scan(
      scheme: "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo",
      device: device,
      clean: true,
      output_directory: "fastlane/test_output",
      output_types: "junit"
    )
  end

  desc "Run only Unit Tests"
  lane :run_unit_tests do |options|
    device = options[:device]
    scan(
      scheme: "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo",
      device: device,
      clean: true,
      only_testing: [
        "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demoTests"
      ],
      output_directory: "fastlane/test_output",
      output_types: "junit"
    )
  end

  desc "Build and upload to Firebase App Distribution"
  lane :beta do |options|
    
    if options[:version_number] && options[:version_number].to_s.strip != ""
      increment_version_number(version_number: options[:version_number])
    end

    if options[:build_number] && options[:build_number].to_s.strip != ""
      increment_build_number(build_number: options[:build_number])
    end

    update_code_signing_settings(
      use_automatic_signing: false,
      path: "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo.xcodeproj",
      team_id: ENV['TEAM_ID'],
      code_sign_identity: "iPhone Developer",
      sdk: "iphoneos*",
      profile_name: "cicd"
    )

    gym(
      scheme: "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo",
      clean: true,
      export_method: "development",
      output_directory: "fastlane/build",
      output_name: "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo.ipa",
      export_options: {
          provisioningProfiles: {
            "com.test.appcicdgithubactionsdemo" => "cicd",
          },
      }
    )

    firebase_app_distribution(
      app: "1:127683058219:ios:98896929fa131c7a80686e",
      firebase_cli_token: ENV["FIREBASE_CLI_TOKEN"],
      release_notes: options[:release_notes] || "New beta build"
    )
  end
end
```

Note: The provisioningProfiles and profile_name correspond to the [Profiles certificate names in App Developer](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list){:target="_blank"}. (If using match, these specifications are not necessary.)

**Fastlane is an indispensable part of iOS CI/CD**, allowing you to quickly develop the actual execution steps of CI/CD using its encapsulated methods; we only need to focus on the overall script design without dealing with complex API connections or command writing.

For example: Fastlane only requires writing "scan(xxx)" to execute tests, whereas writing it as xcodebuild would require " `xcodebuild -workspace ./xxx.xcworkspace -scheme xxx -derivedDataPath xxx ‘platform=iOS Simulator,id=xxx’ clean build test`", and packaging and deployment would be much more troublesome, requiring manual connections to App Store Connect/Firebase API, with key verification needing over 10 lines of code.

**In the demo project, we only have three lanes:**
- run_all_tests: Run all types of tests (Snapshot + Unit)
- run_unit_tests: Run only unit tests (Unit)
- beta: Package and deploy to Firebase App Distribution

#### Fastlane — Match

Due to limitations in the demo project, Match is not used to manage team development and deployment certificates here, but it is still worth mentioning. It is recommended to use Match to manage all development and deployment certificates for the team, making it easier to control and update uniformly.


> _Using Match allows you to directly use commands like `match all` during project setup to install all the necessary certificates for development in one go._ 




- **Fastlane Match will use another Private Repo to manage certificate keys, and in GitHub Actions, you need to set up the SSH Agent to clone another Private Repo.** 
(Please refer to the supplementary section at the end.)

#### Makefile


![Makefile](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*jYACUYFP3MkeHCgeUY7j3w.png)

Makefile

This allows both the development side and CI/CD to use the Makefile to execute commands, making it easier to encapsulate the same environment, paths, and operations.


> _A classic case is that some people use the locally installed `pod install`, while others use the Bundler-managed `bundle exec pod install`. If the versions differ, it may lead to discrepancies._ 





> **_If you find it too complicated, you can skip it and directly write the commands to be executed in the Action Workflow Step._** 





**Makefile:**
```makefile
#!make
PRODUCT_FOLDER = ./Product/
SHELL         := /bin/zsh
.DEFAULT_GOAL := install
MINT_DIRECTORY := ./mint/

export MINT_PATH=$(MINT_DIRECTORY)

## 👇 Help function
.PHONY: help
help:
 @echo ""
 @echo "📖 Available commands:"
 @grep -E '^[a-zA-Z_-]+:.*?## .*$$' $(MAKEFILE_LIST) | \
  awk 'BEGIN {FS = ":.*?## "}; {printf "  \033[36m%-20s\033[0m %s\n", $$1, $$2}'
 @echo ""

## Setup
.PHONY: setup
setup: check-mint ## Install Ruby and Mint dependencies
 @echo "🔨 Installing Ruby dependencies..."
 bundle config set path 'vendor/bundle'
 bundle install
 @echo "🔨 Installing Mint dependencies..."
 mint bootstrap

## Install
.PHONY: install
install: XcodeGen PodInstall ## Execute XcodeGen and CocoaPods installation

.PHONY: XcodeGen
XcodeGen: check-mint ## Generate .xcodeproj using XcodeGen
 @echo "🔨 Execute XcodeGen"
 cd $(PRODUCT_FOLDER) && \
 mint run yonaskolb/XcodeGen --quiet

.PHONY: PodInstall
PodInstall: ## Install CocoaPods dependencies
 @echo "📦 Installing CocoaPods dependencies..."
 cd $(PRODUCT_FOLDER) && \
 bundle exec pod install

### Mint
check-mint: check-brew ## Check if Mint is installed; if not, install it automatically
 @if ! command -v mint &> /dev/null; then \
  echo "🔨 Installing mint..."; \
  brew install mint; \
 fi

### Brew
check-brew: ## Check if Homebrew is installed; if not, install it automatically
 @if ! command -v brew &> /dev/null; then \
  echo "🔨 Installing Homebrew..."; \
  /bin/bash -c "$$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"; \
 fi

## Format only git swift files
.PHONY: format
format: check-mint ## Format all Swift files under Product/
 mint run swiftformat $(PRODUCT_FOLDER)
```

To avoid polluting the entire system or other projects, we try to specify the paths of dependency packages (e.g., mint, bundle, etc.) within the project directory (and use `.gitignore` to exclude them).
```scss
├── mint (Mint dependencies)
│   └── packages
├── Product
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo.xcodeproj
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo.xcworkspace
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demoSnapshotTests
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demoTests
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demoUITests
│   ├── fastlane
│   └── Pods (Cocoapods dependencies)
└── vendor (Bundle dependencies)
    └── bundle
```


![make help](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*F1KFntT8bCZzyYm9JahiuA.png)

make help

**Using Makefile for unified project setup steps:**
1. `git clone repo`
2. `cd ./repo`
3. `make setup` 
Install necessary tool dependencies ( **brew**, **mint**, **bundle**, xcodegen, swiftformat,…)
4. `make install` 
Generate the project (execute pod install, xcodegen)
5. Done
6. Open and run the project



> **_Whether for CI/CD or onboarding new team members, follow the above steps to set up the project._** 




### GitHub Actions CI/CD Case Studies in This Article

This article will introduce three GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow case studies. You can refer to the steps to build a CI/CD that fits your team's workflow.
1. CI — Execute unit tests upon Pull Request
2. CD — Package + deploy to Firebase App Distribution
3. CI + CD — Nightly Build executing snapshot + unit tests + packaging + deploying to Firebase App Distribution



> _Due to demo limitations, this article will only connect to package and deploy to Firebase App Distribution. The steps for packaging to TestFlight or the App Store are the same, with the only difference being the scripts in Fastlane; feel free to explore._ 




### CI — Execute Unit Tests Upon Pull Request
#### Process

The Develop branch **cannot be pushed directly**; a Pull Request must be made to update it. All Pull Requests **must pass Review and unit tests before they can be merged**, and any new Commit Push will trigger retesting.
#### CI-Testing.yml

Repo → Actions → New workflow → set up a workflow yourself.
```yaml
# Workflow (Action) name
name: CI-Testing

# Title name in Actions Log
run-name: "[CI-Testing] ${{ github.event.pull_request.title || github.ref }}"

# If there are new Jobs in the same Concurrency Group, the running ones will be canceled
# For example, if a task triggered by a Push Commit has not executed yet and another Push Commit occurs, the previous task will be canceled
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event_name }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

```markdown

    # It is recommended to use a self-hosted Runner
    runs-on: macos-15

    # Set the maximum timeout duration to prevent endless waiting in case of anomalies

      run:
        shell: zsh {0}
          
    # Job Steps
    # Steps will be executed in order  
    steps:

          # default: false
          lfs: false
          
          # If specified, checkout the specified branch; otherwise, use the default (current branch)
          # Since the on: schedule event can only run on the main branch, if we want to do Nightly Build or similar tasks, we need to specify the branch
          # e.g. on: schedule -> main branch, Nightly Build master branch
          ref: ${{ github.event.inputs.BRANCH || '' }}

      # ========== Env Setup Steps ==========
      
      # Read the specified XCode version for the project
      # In the following steps, we manually specify the XCode_x.x.x.app to use
      # instead of using xcversion, as xcversion has been sunset and is unstable. 
      - name: Read .xcode-version
        id: read_xcode_version
        run: |
          XCODE_VERSION=$(cat .xcode-version)
          echo "XCODE_VERSION: ${XCODE_VERSION}"
          echo "xcode_version=${XCODE_VERSION}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

          # You can also specify the global XCode version here, so you don't need to specify DEVELOPER_DIR in subsequent steps
          # However, this command requires sudoer privileges, so if it's a self-hosted runner, ensure the runner environment has sudo privileges
          # sudo xcode-select -s "/Applications/Xcode_${XCODE_VERSION}.app/Contents/Developer"

      # Read the specified Ruby version for the project
      - name: Read .ruby-version
        id: read_ruby_version
        run: |
          RUBY_VERSION=$(cat .ruby-version)
          echo "RUBY_VERSION: ${RUBY_VERSION}"
          echo "ruby_version=${RUBY_VERSION}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      # Install or set the Runner Ruby version to the specified version
      - name: Set up Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: "${{ steps.read_ruby_version.outputs.ruby_version }}"

      # Optional, because previously when running multiple runners on self-hosted CI/CD, cocoapods repos are in a shared directory
      # The problem solved is: there is a very small chance of conflicts when pulling cocoapods repos during simultaneous pod installs (since the default is $HOME/.cocoapods/)
      # GitHub Hosted Runner does not require this setting
      # - name: Change Cocoapods Repos Folder
      #   if: contains(runner.labels, 'self-hosted')
      #   run: |
      #     # Each Runner uses its own .cocoapods folder to prevent resource conflicts
      #     mkdir -p "$HOME/.cocoapods-${{ env.RUNNER_NAME }}/"
      #     export CP_HOME_DIR="$HOME/.cocoapods-${{ env.RUNNER_NAME }}"
      #     rm -f "$HOME/.cocoapods-${{ env.RUNNER_NAME }}/repos/cocoapods/.git/index.lock"

      # ========== Cache Setting Steps ==========
      # Note that even for self-hosted, Cache is currently Cloud Cache and will count towards usage
      # Rules: Automatically deleted after 7 days of no hits, single Cache limit is 10 GB, Cache only on successful Action
      # Public Repo: Free and unlimited
      # Private Repo: Starting from 5 GB
      # Self-hosted can write Cache & Restore strategies using shell scripts or use other tools for assistance
      
      # Bundle Cache (Gemfile)
      # Corresponds to the installation path specified in the Makefile, ./vendor
      - name: Cache Bundle
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: |

**Technical Highlights:**
- runs-on: It is recommended to use a self-hosted Runner, [GitHub Hosted Runner macOS is very expensive](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/about-billing-for-github-actions#per-minute-rates){:target="_blank"}.
- Manually read the `.xcode-version` file to obtain the specified XCode version and set the `DEVELOPER_DIR` env in steps that require specifying XCode, allowing easy switching without Sudo.
- Cache: Can speed up dependency installation, but note that even for self-hosted Runners, GitHub Cloud Cache is still used and subject to billing limits.
- Using `set +e` allows commands to fail without exiting immediately + outputs everything to a file + reads the file to determine if it was Build Failed or Test Failed; otherwise, the message will uniformly indicate Test Failed.
  It can also be extended to check for other errors, such as: `Underlying Error: Unable to boot the Simulator.` indicating simulator startup failure, please try again.
- Checkout Code can accept specified branches: since the `on: schedule` event can only trigger on the main (Default Branch), if we want to schedule operations on another branch, we need to specify the branch.
- Specifying the .cocoapods Repo path is optional; previously, there were issues with two Runners on the same self-hosted machine getting stuck during pod install due to both operating on the .cocoapods Repo, causing a git lock.
  (But the probability is very low.)
- **If you have a Private Pods Repo, you need to set up SSH Agent to have permission to clone.**
**(Please refer to the additional notes at the end.)**
- Remember to add to Repo -> Settings -> Actions secrets and variables -> variables:
`SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION` for the simulator iOS version
`SIMULATOR_NAME` for the simulator name

#### Technical Details — Obtaining & Setting Firebase CLI Token

Follow the steps in the [Firebase official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli?hl=zh-tw#install-cli-mac-linux){:target="_blank"}:

First, install the Firebase CLI tool:
```bash
curl -sL https://firebase.tools | bash
```

Run:
```bash
firebase login:ci
```

Complete the login and authorization:

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*Jex5aYzRSs7Trfx6z_e1Aw.png)

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*S-1ckn9WC6j0DIqZGSdUUg.png)

Return to the Terminal and copy the Firebase CLI Token:

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*sa_h8L08JbeC2nA0kACQtQ.png)

Go to Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a Secret: `FIREBASE_CLI_TOKEN` and paste the Firebase CLI Token.

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*Lc6yGPu7L_0z6u1HH2PB5A.png)

> **_This Token = your login identity_** _Please keep it safe; if the account is no longer in use, it also needs to be changed._

#### Technical Details — Install the Apple certificate and provisioning profile

Supplementary details on importing development certificates into the Runner.

Since GitHub Actions Secrets cannot store files, all certificate files must first be converted to Base64 Encoded text format and stored in Secrets. The GitHub Actions Step will then dynamically read them and write them to TEMP files, moving them to the correct location for the system to read and use.

**Packaging Development requires two key certificates:**
- [Provision Profile \( .mobileprovision\)](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list){:target="_blank"}
- [Development Certificate \( .p12\)](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list){:target="_blank"}

![cicd.mobileprovision](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*WXqqnErto3nn8rnNg6TXgw.png)

cicd.mobileprovision

![development.cer](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*RkeZ1PkXeY9Nt1kSRJKEQw.png)

development.cer

The Certificate downloaded from [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list){:target="_blank"} is in .cer format, while we need it in .p12 format. You can double-click the downloaded .cer to install it in Keychain, then right-click the certificate in Keychain and select Export.

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*HJMxwM3IDjxT-UGqnoUtWw.png)

File name: cicd.p12, Format: .p12

P12 key password: Enter a secure custom string (the example is a bad demonstration, using `123456`)

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*tyH0XqDVPGPWFJPL4dxksw.png)

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*qKeZWel3w_5wW7meMtHmLA.png)

**Now both files: cicd.p12 and cicd.mobileprovision are ready.**

**Convert to BASE64 format string and store in Repo Secrets:**
```bash
base64 -i cicd.mobileprovision | pbcopy
```

Go to Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a Secret: `BUILD_PROVISION_PROFILE_BASE64` and paste the above content.

\-
```bash
base64 -i cicd.p12 | pbcopy
```

Go to Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a Secret: `BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` and paste the above content.

\-
Go to Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a Secret: `P12_PASSWORD` with the password you set when exporting the P12 key.

\-
Go to Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a Secret: `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`:
If it is a GitHub Hosted Runner, enter any arbitrary string. **If it is a Self-hosted Runner, it should be the login password of the macOS Runner user.**

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*JZCkFUJCQsggqYtW8acjTw.png)

#### Technical Details — App Store Connect API Key

Fastlane packaging and deployment to the App Store, Testflight [requires providing a .json key](https://docs.fastlane.tools/app-store-connect-api/){:target="_blank"}. Similarly, due to GitHub Actions Secrets being limited to storing strings and not files, we also need to convert the key content into a Base64 string. The GitHub Actions Step will then dynamically read it and write it to a TEMP file, providing the file path for Fastlane to reference.

**First, go to [App Store Connect to create & download the App Store Connect API Key](../f1365e51902c/) \( .p8\):**
```vbnet
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
sss
axzzvcxz
zxzvzcxv
vzxcvzxvczxcvz
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Create a new `app_store_connect_api.json` file \( [content reference](https://docs.fastlane.tools/app-store-connect-api/){:target="_blank"} \):
```bash
{
  "key_id": "Key ID written on App Store Connect",
  "issuer_id": "Issuer ID written on App Store Connect",
  "key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- remember to replace line breaks with\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----",
  "duration": 1200, # optional (maximum 1200)
  "in_house": false # optional but may be required if using match/sigh
}
```

After saving the file, run:
```bash
base64 -i app_store_connect_api.json | pbcopy
```

Paste the string content into Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a Secret: `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_BASE64` and paste the above content.

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*QxRuxEPEfWbJ383hhnxGkA.png)

After the `Read and Write Apple Store Connect API Key to Temp` Step is completed, in subsequent Steps, just pass in the env `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH`:
```yaml
- name: Deploy
  env:
    APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH: "${{ runner.temp }}/${{ env.APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_FILE_NAME }}"
  run: |
    ....
```

Fastlane will automatically retrieve and use it.
#### Technical Extension — Reuse Action Workflow to Separate Packaging and Deployment Actions

In this case, we directly use Fastlane's `beta` Lane to execute both packaging and deployment actions.

In practical cases, we may need to deploy the same package result to different platforms (Firebase, Testflight, etc.), so a better approach is to have packaging as one Action and deployment as another Action; otherwise, it will run packaging twice, which also aligns better with CI/CD's division of responsibilities.

#### GitHub Actions — Artifact

Similar to Cache, even for Self-hosted Runner, the Artifact feature still operates through GitHub Cloud and is subject to usage limits \( [free account starts at 500MB](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/about-billing-for-github-actions#included-storage-and-minutes){:target="_blank"} \).

> _To achieve similar effects with a Self-hosted Runner, you can create a shared host directory or find other tools as alternatives._

Currently, I only use Artifact to store small data, such as error results from Snapshot Tests, test reports, etc.
### CI— Nightly Build Executing Snapshot + Unit Tests + Packaging + CD Deployment to Firebase App Distribution
#### Process

Every day at 3 AM, all tests (unit + snapshot tests) are automatically run against the main (develop or master) branch. If they fail, a failure notification is sent to the Slack workgroup; if successful, a version is packaged and deployed to Firebase App Distribution, with success/failure notifications sent to Slack.

We can directly install the Nightly Build version on our mobile phones for an early experience test.
#### Technical Details

This Action reuses the previously designed CI-Testing and CD-Deploy to create our Nightly Build, which is very flexible and easy to use!

### Self-hosted Runner Considerations

This article uses a Public Repo, so we directly use GitHub Hosted macOS Runner. However, in actual work, our Repo will definitely be Private, and using GitHub Hosted Runner is very expensive (you could buy a Mac Mini for the price of a month’s usage and run it comfortably in the office), and each machine can run multiple Runners concurrently based on performance.

> **_For details, refer to the [previous article](../404bd5c70040/) " [Building and Switching to Self-hosted Runner](../404bd5c70040/) " section_** _After installing XCode and the basic environment on your local computer, register and enable the Runner, and change `runs-on` in the Action Workflow YAML to `[self-hosted]`._

The issue of multiple Runners on the same computer has mostly been resolved in the Actions above, such as changing all shared directories to local directories. There is also a problem that may arise during testing, which is the simulator conflict issue: "**When two test Jobs are run by two Runners on the same machine simultaneously, if they specify the same simulator, they will interfere with each other, causing the tests to fail.**"

The solution is simple: set a separate simulator for each Runner.
#### Simulator Configuration for Multiple Runners on the Same Machine

Assuming I have **two Runners on the same computer** receiving tasks in parallel:
- `ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-A`

In the XCode simulator settings, we need to add two simulators:

- Model and iOS version should match the testing environment.

**Change the testing steps in CI-Testing.yml to:**
```bash
# Run Fastlane Unit Test Lane
      - name: Run Tests
        id: testing
        # Specify the working directory, so subsequent commands don't need to cd ./Product/
        working-directory: ./Product/
        env:
          # ...
          # Repo -> Settings -> Actions secrets and variables -> variables
          # iOS version of the simulator
          SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION: ${{ vars.SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION }}

          # Current Runner name
          RUNNER_NAME: ${{ runner.name }}
          
          # ...
        run: |

          # ...
          bundle exec fastlane ${TEST_LANE} device:"${RUNNER_NAME} (${SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION})" | tee "$RUNNER_TEMP/testing_output.txt"
          # ...
```
- Change `device` to `${RUNNER_NAME} (${SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION})`
- `SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION` should still refer to the Repo variables.

**The combined result will be (using 18.4 as an example):**
- Runner: `ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-A` 
Simulator: **ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-A(18.4)**
- Runner: `ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-B` 
Simulator: **ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-B(18.4)**

This way, when both Runners are executing tests simultaneously, they will each run their own simulators.

### Additional SSH Agent Configuration — For Fastlane Match or Private CocoaPods Repo

When using Fastlane Match or Private CocoaPods Repo, since it is in another Private Repo, the current Repo/Action environment cannot directly git clone. You need to set up the SSH agent environment to have permission to operate during Action execution.
#### Step 1. Generate SSH Key

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*kPWl9hombBgQ15i-n2sY2A.png)

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "zhgchgli@gmail.com"
```

`Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/zhgchgli/.ssh/id_ed25519):` /Users/zhgchgli/Downloads/zhgchgli
- Enter the download path for easy copying of the content.

`Enter passphrase for “/Users/zhgchgli/Downloads/zhgchgli” (empty for no passphrase):`
- **Leave it blank:** CI/CD usage cannot input Passphrase interactively in CLI, **so please leave it blank.**
- Generation complete (with .pub/private_key).

#### Step 2. Set Deploy Key in Private Repo

github-actions-ci-cd-demo-certificates Repo

Settings → Security → Deploy keys → Add deploy key.
- Title: Enter the key name.
- Key: `Paste the .pub key content.`

Done.

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*Xo_g-AchEk0j4SGXOmBuxg.jpeg)

#### Step 3. Set SSH Private Key to Secrets in Action's Repo

![github-actions-ci-cd-demo Repo](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*Jm92pQHMOImQzZtmmvd1ng.jpeg)

github-actions-ci-cd-demo Repo

Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret.
- Name: Enter the secret variable name `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`.
- Secret: `Paste the private_key content.`

Done.
#### Step 4. SSH Agent Configuration Complete, Verify Git Clone Private Repo Permissions

[**Demo-Git-Clone-Private-Repo.yml**](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/actions/workflows/Demo-Git-Clone-Private-Repo.yml){:target="_blank"} **:**
```yaml
name: Demo Git Clone Private Repo

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  clone-private-repo:
    name: Git Clone Private Repo
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30

    steps:
      # 🔐 Enable SSH Agent and add private key
      - name: Setup SSH Agent
        uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.9.0
        with:
          ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}

      # 🛡️ Add github.com to known_hosts to avoid host verification errors
      - name: Add GitHub to known_hosts
        run: |
          mkdir -p ~/.ssh
          ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
      # 📦 Use SSH to clone private repo and verify
      - name: Clone and Verify Private Repo
        run: |
          git clone git@github.com:ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo-certificates.git ./fakeMatch/
          if [ -d "./fakeMatch/.git" ]; then
            echo "✅ Repo cloned successfully into ./fakeMatch/"
            cd ./fakeMatch
            echo "📌 Current commit: $(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
          else
            echo "❌ Clone failed. SSH Agent may not be configured properly."
            exit 1
          fi
```

You can use the above Action to verify if the setup was successful.

Success, subsequent `fastlane match` or `pod install` for private pods should execute correctly.
