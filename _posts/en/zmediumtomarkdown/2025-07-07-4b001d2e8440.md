#### Preface

The previous article "[**CI/CD Practical Guide (Part 2): Comprehensive Use and Setup of GitHub Actions and Self-hosted Runner**](../404bd5c70040/)" introduced the basics and workflow of GitHub Actions, how to use your own machine as a Runner, and guided you through three simple automated Actions; **this article will focus deeply on building an App (iOS) CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions in real-world use**, walking you step-by-step while supplementing relevant GitHub Actions knowledge.

### App CI/CD Workflow Diagram

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*VRygfRAkBRNEDAC4RyGzRA.png)

This article focuses on the GitHub Actions section for building CI/CD. The next article, "[CI/CD Practical Guide (Part 4): Using Google Apps Script Web App to Connect with GitHub Actions to Build a Free and Easy Packaging Tool Platform](../4273e57e7148/)," will cover the right half, which introduces building a cross-team collaborative packaging platform using Google Apps Script Web App.

#### Workflow:

1. GitHub Actions Triggered by Pull Request, Form Submission, or Scheduled Timing

2. Execute Corresponding Workflow Jobs/Steps

3. Step Executes the Corresponding Fastlane (iOS) or (Android Gradle) Script

4. Fastlane Executes Corresponding xcodebuild (iOS) Commands

5. Get Execution Result

6. Subsequent Workflow Jobs/Steps Process Results

7. Completed

#### GitHub Actions Results Image

First, let's show the final result to give everyone some motivation to implement!

### GitHub Actions x Self-hosted Runner Basics

If you are not yet familiar with GitHub Actions and setting up a Self-hosted Runner, it is highly recommended to first read the previous article "[**CI/CD Practical Guide (Part 2): Comprehensive Use and Setup of GitHub Actions and Self-hosted Runner**](../404bd5c70040/)" or practice alongside the knowledge from that article.

> ***Implementation begins!***

### Infra Architecture of the iOS Demo Project

[![](https://opengraph.githubassets.com/5952f3220c95ced947b9ee50d9c542b2edbb424be50c51c582cb226ce5f5df63/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo)](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo){:target="_blank"}

**The iOS project content used in this article, including test items, is generated by AI**, so there is no need to focus on iOS code details. The discussion will only cover Infra & CI/CD aspects.

> ***The following tools are based on past experience. For new projects, consider using the newer [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise){:target="_blank"} and [tuist](https://github.com/tuist/tuist){:target="_blank"} .***

#### Mint

[![](https://opengraph.githubassets.com/cfba5c7658c860d0ee4e97df8176a3fc6bbfd9f84c2e8334eaa30988c2700d63/yonaskolb/Mint)](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint){:target="_blank"}

Mint tool helps us unify the management of dependency tool versions (Gemfile can only manage Ruby Gems), such as XCodeGen, SwiftFormat, SwiftLint, Periphery.

…etc

**Mintfile:**

```graphql
yonaskolb/Mint@0.17.5
yonaskolb/XcodeGen@2.35.0
nicklockwood/SwiftFormat@0.51.13
```

Here we only use three.

> ***If it feels too complicated, you can skip it and directly use brew install to install the required tools in the Action Workflow Step.***

#### Bundle

**Gemfile:**

```bash
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'cocoapods', '~>1.16.0'
gem 'fastlane', '~>2.228.0'

plugins_path = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'Product', 'fastlane', 'Pluginfile')
eval_gemfile(plugins_path) if File.exist?(plugins_path)
```

Managing Ruby (Gems) dependencies, the two most commonly used tools in iOS projects are `cocoapods` and `fastlane`.

#### Cocoapods

**Product/podfile:**

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo' do
  pod 'SnapKit'
end 
```

Although it has been announced as [soon to be deprecated](https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Specs-Repo/){:target="_blank"}, Cocoapods is still common in older iOS projects. Here, a simple Snapkit demo is added.

#### XCodeGen

To avoid conflicts caused by changes to `.xcodeproj` / `.xcworkspace` during multi-developer collaboration, use Project.yaml to define the XCode Project content uniformly, then generate the Project files locally (do not commit to Git).

**Product/project.yaml:**

```yaml
name: app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo
options:
  bundleIdPrefix: com.example
  deploymentTarget:
    iOS: '13.0'
  usesTabs: false
  indentWidth: 2

packages:
  SnapshotTesting:
    url: https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing
    from: 1.18.4
```

SnapshotTesting: Managing with Swift Package Manager.

#### Fastlane

Encapsulating complex steps such as xcodebuild commands, integrating with App Store Connect API, Firebase API, and other services.

**Product/fastlane/Fastfile:**

```php

default_platform(:ios)

platform :ios do
  desc "Run all tests (Unit Tests + UI Tests)"
  lane :run_all_tests do \|options\|
    device = options[:device]
    scan(
      scheme: "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo",
      device: device,
      clean: true,
      output_directory: "fastlane/test_output",
      output_types: "junit"
    )
  end

  desc "Run only Unit Tests"
  lane :run_unit_tests do \|options\|
    device = options[:device]
    scan(
      scheme: "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo",
      device: device,
      clean: true,
      only_testing: [
        "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demoTests"
      ],
      output_directory: "fastlane/test_output",
      output_types: "junit"
    )
  end

  desc "Build and upload to Firebase App Distribution"
  lane :beta do \|options\|
    
    if options[:version_number] && options[:version_number].to_s.strip != ""
      increment_version_number(version_number: options[:version_number])
    end

    if options[:build_number] && options[:build_number].to_s.strip != ""
      increment_build_number(build_number: options[:build_number])
    end

    update_code_signing_settings(
      use_automatic_signing: false,
      path: "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo.xcodeproj",
      team_id: ENV['TEAM_ID'],
      code_sign_identity: "iPhone Developer",
      sdk: "iphoneos*",
      profile_name: "cicd"
    )

    gym(
      scheme: "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo",
      clean: true,
      export_method: "development",
      output_directory: "fastlane/build",
      output_name: "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo.ipa",
      export_options: {
          provisioningProfiles: {
            "com.test.appcicdgithubactionsdemo" => "cicd",
          },
      }
    )

    firebase_app_distribution(
      app: "1:127683058219:ios:98896929fa131c7a80686e",
      firebase_cli_token: ENV["FIREBASE_CLI_TOKEN"],
      release_notes: options[:release_notes] \|\| "New beta build"
    )
  end
end
```

Note: provisioningProfiles and profile_name correspond to the [Profiles certificate names in App Developer](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list){:target="_blank"}. (If using match, these do not need to be specified.)

**Fastlane is an essential part of iOS CI/CD**, allowing you to quickly develop the actual CI/CD execution steps by using its pre-packaged methods; we only need to focus on the overall script design without dealing with complex API integrations or command writing.

For example: Fastlane only requires writing "scan(xxx)" to run tests, while using xcodebuild needs "`xcodebuild -workspace ./xxx.xcworkspace -scheme xxx -derivedDataPath xxx ‘platform=iOS Simulator,id=xxx’ clean build test`". Packaging and deployment are even more troublesome, as you need to integrate with App Store Connect/Firebase API yourself, and the key authentication alone requires writing over 10 lines of code.

**The demo project has only three lanes:**

- run_all_tests: Run all types of tests (Snapshot + Unit)

- run_unit_tests: Run only unit tests (Unit)

- beta: Packaging and deploying to Firebase App Distribution

#### Fastlane — Match

Due to Demo project limitations, Match was not used here to manage the team's development and deployment certificates. However, it is recommended to use Match to manage all development and deployment certificates for the team, making control and updates easier and more unified.

> *With Match, you can use commands like `match all` directly in the project setup step to install all the development certificates you need with one click.*

- **Fastlane Match uses another private repo to manage certificate keys. In GitHub Actions, you need to set up the SSH Agent to clone the other private repo.**

#### Makefile

![Makefile](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*jYACUYFP3MkeHCgeUY7j3w.png)

Makefile

Unify the development side and CI/CD to use Makefile for executing commands, making it easier to package the same environment, paths, and operations.

> *A classic example is that some people use the locally installed `pod install`, while others use the Bundler-managed `bundle exec pod install`. Differences may arise if the versions differ.*

> ***If you find it too complicated and prefer not to use it, you can simply write the commands to execute directly in the Action Workflow Step.***

**Makefile:**

```makefile
#!make
PRODUCT_FOLDER = ./Product/
SHELL         := /bin/zsh
.DEFAULT_GOAL := install
MINT_DIRECTORY := ./mint/

export MINT_PATH=$(MINT_DIRECTORY)

## 👇 Help function
.PHONY: help
help:
 @echo ""
 @echo "📖 Available commands:"
 @grep -E '^[a-zA-Z_-]+:.*?## .*$$' $(MAKEFILE_LIST) \| \
  awk 'BEGIN {FS = ":.*?## "}; {printf "  \033[36m%-20s\033[0m %s\n", $$1, $$2}'
 @echo ""

## Setup
.PHONY: setup
setup: check-mint ## Install Ruby and Mint dependencies
 @echo "🔨 Installing Ruby dependencies..."
 bundle config set path 'vendor/bundle'
 bundle install
 @echo "🔨 Installing Mint dependencies..."
 mint bootstrap

## Install
.PHONY: install
install: XcodeGen PodInstall ## Run XcodeGen and CocoaPods install

.PHONY: XcodeGen
XcodeGen: check-mint ## Generate .xcodeproj using XcodeGen
 @echo "🔨 Execute XcodeGen"
 cd $(PRODUCT_FOLDER) && \
 mint run yonaskolb/XcodeGen --quiet

.PHONY: PodInstall
PodInstall: ## Install CocoaPods dependencies
 @echo "📦 Installing CocoaPods dependencies..."
 cd $(PRODUCT_FOLDER) && \
 bundle exec pod install

### Mint
check-mint: check-brew ## Check if Mint is installed, install if missing
 @if ! command -v mint &> /dev/null; then \
  echo "🔨 Installing mint..."; \
  brew install mint; \
 fi

### Brew
check-brew: ## Check if Homebrew is installed, install if missing
 @if ! command -v brew &> /dev/null; then \
  echo "🔨 Installing Homebrew..."; \
  /bin/bash -c "$$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"; \
 fi

## Format only git swift files
.PHONY: format
format: check-mint ## Format all Swift files under Product/
 mint run swiftformat $(PRODUCT_FOLDER)
```

To avoid contaminating the entire system or other projects, we try to set the paths of Dependency packages (e.g. mint, bundle, etc.) within the project directory (combined with `.gitignore` exclusion).

```scss
├── mint (Mint dependencies)
│   └── packages
├── Product
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo.xcodeproj
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo.xcworkspace
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demoSnapshotTests
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demoTests
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demoUITests
│   ├── fastlane
│   └── Pods (Cocoapods dependencies)
└── vendor (Bundle dependencies)
    └── bundle
```

Please provide the Markdown paragraph you want me to translate into English.

**Unified Project Setup Steps Using Makefine:**

1. `git clone repo`

2. `cd ./repo`

3. `make setup`  
   Install necessary tool dependencies (**brew**, **mint**, **bundle**, xcodegen, swiftformat, …)

4. `make install`  
   Generate the project (run pod install, xcodegen)

5. Completed

6. Open and Run the Project

> ***Whether it's CI/CD or onboarding new members, build the project following the above steps.***

### This GitHub Actions CI/CD Example

This article introduces three GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow examples. You can also refer to these steps to build CI/CD workflows that fit your team's needs.

1. CI — Run Unit Tests on Pull Request Submission

2. CD — Packaging + Deploying to Firebase App Distribution

3. CI + CD — Nightly Build: Execute Snapshot + Unit Tests + Packaging + Deploy to Firebase App Distribution

> *Due to demo limitations, this article only covers integration and deployment to Firebase App Distribution. Packaging for Testflight or the App Store follows the same steps, with differences only in the Fastlane scripts. Feel free to adapt as needed.*

### CI — Run Unit Tests on Pull Request

#### Process

The Develop branch **cannot be pushed to directly**; updates must be made via Pull Request. All Pull Requests **require review approval and passing unit tests before merging**. Any new commit push will trigger retesting.

#### CI-Testing.yml

Repo → Actions → New workflow → set up a workflow yourself.

```yaml
# Workflow(Action) Name
name: CI-Testing

# Actions Log Title
run-name: "[CI-Testing] ${{ github.event.pull_request.title \|\| github.ref }}"

# Cancel running jobs in the same Concurrency Group if a new job starts
# For example, if a commit push triggers a job that hasn't started yet and another commit push happens, the previous job will be canceled
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event_name }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number \|\| github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

          # You can also set global XCode version here to avoid specifying DEVELOPER_DIR later
          # But this requires sudo privileges; for self-hosted runners ensure the runner has sudo rights

      # ========== Cache Setting Steps ==========
      # Note: Even self-hosted runners use cloud cache which counts usage
      # Rules: auto delete if not hit for 7 days, max 10 GB per cache, only cache on successful action
      # Public Repo: free unlimited
      # Private Repo: starts at 5 GB

**Technical Highlights:**

- runs-on: It is recommended to use a self-hosted Runner, as [GitHub Hosted Runner macOS is very expensive](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/about-billing-for-github-actions#per-minute-rates){:target="_blank"}.

- Manually read the `.xcode-version` file to get the specified XCode version and set the `DEVELOPER_DIR` environment variable in steps that require a specific XCode version. This allows easy XCode switching without using Sudo.

- Cache: Can speed up dependency installation, but note that even self-hosted Runners use GitHub Cloud Cache and are subject to billing limits.

- Use `set +e` to prevent the script from exiting immediately on command failure, redirect all output to a file, and read the file to determine if it is a Build Failed or Test Failed; otherwise, the message will always be Test Failed.  
  You can also extend this to detect other errors, for example: `Underlying Error: Unable to boot the Simulator.` Simulator failed to start, please try again.

- Checkout Code accepts a specified branch: Since the `on: schedule` event can only be triggered on the main (Default Branch), if we want the schedule to operate on another branch, we need to specify the branch.

- Specifying the .cocoapods Repo path is optional. Previously, when using self-hosted runners on the same machine, two runners got stuck at pod install because both were operating on the .cocoapods Repo simultaneously, causing a git lock.  
  (However, the chance of this happening is very low.)

- **If you have a Private Pods Repo that requires setting up an SSH Agent to have permission to clone.**  
  **(Please refer to the supplementary notes at the end)**

- Remember to add in Repo -> Settings -> Actions secrets and variables -> variables:  
  `SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION` Simulator iOS version  
  `SIMULATOR_NAME` Simulator name

Continue with the correct settings.

#### GitHub Workflow Setup

Repo → Settings → Rules → Rulesets。

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*cf_M6NnakdcbzvC2VHSfpw.png)

- Ruleset Name: Ruleset Name

- Enforcement status: Enable/Disable this rule restriction

- Target branches: The target Base branches. Setting the Default Branch means all branches intended to merge into main or develop are subject to this rule.

- Bypass list: Specific identities or Teams can be exempted from this restriction

- Branch rules:

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*Hzd9CCTsu18kyDR1goRWag.png)

- Restrict deletions: Prohibit branch deletions

- Require a pull request before merging: Only allow merging through PR  
  Required approvals: Limit the number of required approvals

- Require status checks to pass: Restrict which checks must pass before merging  
  Click + Add checks, enter `Testing`, and select the one with the GitHub Actions icon.  
  **There is a small issue here: if Suggestions** **cannot find `Testing`, you need to go back to Actions and trigger it first (try opening a PR) to succeed once, then it will appear here.**

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*MRPwUEVVbbz8nH0sS2hFfQ.png)

- Block force pushes: Disable Force Push

After saving and confirming the Enforcement status is Active, the rule will take effect.

**After everything is set, open a PR to test it:**

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*iPETBWx6Boq12rY1fHXmuQ.png)

- Checks show CI-Testing (**Required**), Merging is blocked, and At least X approving review is required by reviewers with write access. This means the setup is successful.

**If the project build fails (Build Failed), it will Comment:**

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*4E35VRPo--pI8uqrR4UZNA.png)

**If the project builds successfully but the test cases fail (Test Failed), it will Comment:**

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*wYFzsn5a_yvi8CbZxi-QdQ.png)

**If the project build and test are successful (Test Success), it will Comment:**

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*WqPK1629jYdYTEWCWBHWqg.png)

**After completing Review Approve + Check tests successfully:**

![[Demo PR](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/pull/11){:target="_blank"}](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*5gnQYdVAOtGR-bMK4ZrOhA.png)

[Demo PR](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/pull/11){:target="_blank"}

Then you can merge the PR.

- If a new commit is pushed, the checks will automatically rerun.

**Full Code: [CI-Testing.yml](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/CI-Testing.yml){:target="_blank"}**

**Auto-merge:**

Additionally, you can also open Repo Settings → General → Pull Request and enable:

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*hl6mfqnnv_zAA3YVrI_M0w.png)

- Automatically delete head branches: Automatically delete branches after merging PRs

- Allow Auto-merge: When checks pass and the required approvals are met, the PR will be merged automatically.  
  **The Enable auto-merge button only appears when conditions are set and the current conditions do not yet allow merging.**

#### Technical Details — Obtaining & Setting Firebase CLI Token

According to the [Firebase official documentation steps](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli?hl=zh-tw#install-cli-mac-linux){:target="_blank"}:

First, install the Firebase CLI tool:

```bash
curl -sL https://firebase.tools \| bash
```

Execute:

```bash
firebase login:ci
```

Complete login and authorization:

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*Jex5aYzRSs7Trfx6z_e1Aw.png)

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*S-1ckn9WC6j0DIqZGSdUUg.png)

Back to Terminal, copy the Firebase CLI Token:

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*sa_h8L08JbeC2nA0kACQtQ.png)

Go to Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a new Secret: `FIREBASE_CLI_TOKEN` and paste the Firebase CLI Token.

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*Lc6yGPu7L_0z6u1HH2PB5A.png)

> ***This Token = your login identity*** *Please keep it safe. If the account holder leaves, it must be replaced.*

#### Technical Details — Install the Apple Certificate and Provisioning Profile

Supplement detailed steps for importing development certificates into Runner.

Since GitHub Actions Secrets cannot store files, all credential files must first be converted to Base64 encoded text and saved in Secrets. Then, in the GitHub Actions step, they are dynamically read, written to a TEMP file, and moved to the correct location for the system to access.

**Packaging Development requires two key certificates:**

- [Provision Profile ( .mobileprovision)](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list){:target="_blank"}

- [Development Certificate ( .p12)](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list){:target="_blank"}

![cicd.mobileprovision](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*WXqqnErto3nn8rnNg6TXgw.png)

cicd.mobileprovision

![development.cer](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*RkeZ1PkXeY9Nt1kSRJKEQw.png)

development.cer

The Certificate downloaded from [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list){:target="_blank"} is in .cer format, but we need it in .p12 format. You can double-click the downloaded .cer file to install it into Keychain, then open Keychain, right-click the certificate, and choose Export.

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*HJMxwM3IDjxT-UGqnoUtWw.png)

File name: cicd.p12, format .p12

P12 Key Password: Enter a secure custom string (the example is a bad practice, using `123456`)

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*tyH0XqDVPGPWFJPL4dxksw.png)

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*qKeZWel3w_5wW7meMtHmLA.png)

**Now two files are ready:** cicd.p12, cicd.mobileprovision

**Convert to BASE64 String and Save to Repo Secrets:**

```bash
base64 -i cicd.mobileprovision \| pbcopy
```

Go to Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a new Secret: `BUILD_PROVISION_PROFILE_BASE64` and paste the above content.

-

```bash
base64 -i cicd.p12 \| pbcopy
```

Go to Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a new Secret: `BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` and paste the above content.

-

Go to Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a new Secret: `P12_PASSWORD` with the password used when exporting the P12 key.

-
Go to Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a new Secret: `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`:
If using a GitHub Hosted Runner, enter any random string. **If using a Self-hosted Runner, enter the login password of the macOS Runner user**.

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*JZCkFUJCQsggqYtW8acjTw.png)

#### Technical Details — App Store Connect API Key

Fastlane packaging and deployment to App Store, Testflight [Required .json key](https://docs.fastlane.tools/app-store-connect-api/){:target="_blank"} is also limited by GitHub Actions Secrets, which can only store strings, not files. Therefore, we need to convert the key content into a Base64 string, then dynamically read it in the GitHub Actions step, write it to a TEMP file, and provide the file path to Fastlane for use.

**First, go to [App Store Connect to create & download the App Store Connect API Key](../f1365e51902c/) (.p8):**

```vbnet
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
sss
axzzvcxz
zxzvzcxv
vzxcvzxvczxcvz
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Add a new `app_store_connect_api.json` file ( [refer to content](https://docs.fastlane.tools/app-store-connect-api/){:target="_blank"} ):

```bash
{
  "key_id": "Key ID as written in App Store Connect",
  "issuer_id": "Issuer ID as written in App Store Connect",
  "key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- Remember to replace line breaks with \\n -----END PRIVATE KEY-----",
  "duration": 1200, # optional (maximum 1200)
  "in_house": false # optional but may be required if using match/sigh
}
```

Run after saving the file:

```bash
base64 -i app_store_connect_api.json \| pbcopy
```

Paste the string content into Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a new Secret: `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_BASE64` and paste the above content.

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*QxRuxEPEfWbJ383hhnxGkA.png)

After completing the `Read and Write Apple Store Connect API Key to Temp` step, in the following steps just pass the env `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH`:

```yaml
- name: Deploy
  env:
    APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH: "${{ runner.temp }}/${{ env.APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_FILE_NAME }}"
  run: \|
    ....
```

Fastlane can automatically obtain usage.

#### Technical Extension — Reuse Action Workflow: Splitting, Packaging, and Deploying Actions

In this case, we directly use the Fastlane `beta` lane to perform both packaging and deployment.

In real cases, we may need to deploy the same build to different platforms (Firebase, Testflight, etc.). Therefore, a better approach is to have packaging as one action and deployment as another action, to avoid running the packaging process twice. This also aligns better with the responsibility division in CI/CD.

```

#### GitHub Actions — Artifact

Like Cache, currently **even the Self-hosted Runner Artifact feature still uses GitHub Cloud**, subject to usage limits ([free accounts start at 500MB](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/about-billing-for-github-actions#included-storage-and-minutes){:target="_blank"}).

> *To achieve a similar effect with a Self-hosted Runner, you can create a shared host directory yourself or use other tools as alternatives.*

Therefore, I currently use Artifact only to store small data, such as Snapshot Test errors, test reports, and so on.

### CI— Nightly Build Snapshot + Unit Tests + Packaging + CD Deployment to Firebase App Distribution

#### Process

Run all tests (unit + snapshot tests) automatically at 3 AM daily on the main (develop or master) branch. If tests fail, send a failure notification to the Slack workspace; if successful, package and deploy a version to Firebase App Distribution. Send Slack notifications for both packaging success and failure.

We can directly install the Nightly Build version on our phones for early testing and experience.

#### Technical Details

This Action directly reuses the previously designed CI-Testing and CD-Deploy, combining them into our Nightly Build. It's very flexible and easy to use!

### Self-hosted Runner Notes

This article uses a Public Repo, so it directly uses GitHub Hosted macOS Runners. However, in actual work, our Repos are always Private. Using GitHub Hosted Runners is very expensive and not cost-effective (about the cost of buying a Mac Mini per month to run continuously in the office). Each Mac Mini can run multiple Runners concurrently based on its performance to handle tasks.

> ***For details, please refer to the [previous article](../404bd5c70040/) section " [Setting up and Switching to Self-hosted Runner](../404bd5c70040/)".* After installing XCode and the basic environment on your local computer, register and activate the Runner, then change `runs-on` to `[self-hosted]` in the Action Workflow YAML.***

The issue of multiple Runners on the same computer has mostly been resolved in the Actions above, such as changing all dependent shared directories to local directories. Another problem encountered during testing that needs to be addressed is the simulator contention issue: "**When two test Jobs are run simultaneously by two Runners on the same machine, specifying the same simulator causes interference, leading to test failures.**"

The solution is simple: assign one emulator to each individual Runner.

#### Setting Multiple Runners on the Same Machine Emulator

Assuming I have **two Runners on the same computer** receiving tasks in parallel:

- `ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-A`

- `ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-B`

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*3ptg9Tl5fBbEIYB4kgh0kw.png)

In XCode Simulator settings, we need to add two simulators:

- Model, iOS Version, and Test Environment

**Change the test steps in CI-Testing.yml to:**

```bash

        working-directory: ./Product/
        env:
          # ...
          # Repo -> Settings -> Actions secrets and variables -> variables
          # Simulator iOS version
          SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION: ${{ vars.SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION }}

          # Current Runner name
          RUNNER_NAME: ${{ runner.name }}
          
          # ...
        run: \|

          # ...
          bundle exec fastlane ${TEST_LANE} device:"${RUNNER_NAME} (${SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION})" \| tee "$RUNNER_TEMP/testing_output.txt"
          # ...
```

- `device` **change to** `${RUNNER_NAME} (${SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION})`

- `SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION` is still uniformly referenced from the Repo variables.

**The combined result will be (using 18.4 as an example):**

- Runner: `ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-A`  
  Simulator: **ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-A(18.4)**

- Runner: `ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-B`  
  Simulator: **ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-B(18.4)**

This way, when two Runners run tests simultaneously, two simulators will start and run independently.

### Additional SSH Agent Setup — For Fastlane Match or Private CocoaPods Repo

When using Fastlane Match or a Private CocoaPods Repo, since it is in another Private Repo, the current Repo/Action environment cannot directly git clone. You need to set up the SSH agent environment to have permission to operate during the Action execution.

#### Step 1. Generate SSH Key

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*kPWl9hombBgQ15i-n2sY2A.png)

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "zhgchgli@gmail.com"
```

`Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/zhgchgli/.ssh/id_ed25519):` /Users/zhgchgli/Downloads/zhgchgli

- Enter the download path to make it easier for us to copy the content

`Enter passphrase for “/Users/zhgchgli/Downloads/zhgchgli” (empty for no passphrase):`

- **Leave Blank:** For CI/CD usage, passphrase input is not possible in CLI interaction, **so please leave it blank**

- Generation completed ( .pub/private_key)

#### Step 2. Set Deploy Key in Private Repo

Settings → Security → Deploy keys → Add deploy key.

- Title: Enter Key Name

- Key: `Paste the .pub Key content`

Completed.

#### Step 3. Set SSH Private Key to Secrets in the Action's Repo

![github-actions-ci-cd-demo Repo](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*Jm92pQHMOImQzZtmmvd1ng.jpeg)

github-actions-ci-cd-demo Repo

Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret.

- Name: Enter the key variable name `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`

- Secret: `Paste the private_key content`

Completed.

#### Step 4. SSH Agent setup completed, now verify the permission for Git Clone Private Repo

[**Demo-Git-Clone-Private-Repo.yml**](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/actions/workflows/Demo-Git-Clone-Private-Repo.yml){:target="_blank"} **:**

```yaml
name: Demo Git Clone Private Repo

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  clone-private-repo:
    name: Git Clone Private Repo
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30

    steps:
      # 🔐 Enable SSH Agent and add private key
      - name: Setup SSH Agent
        uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.9.0
        with:
          ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}

      # 🛡️ Add github.com to known_hosts to avoid host verification errors
      - name: Add GitHub to known_hosts
        run: \|
          mkdir -p ~/.ssh
          ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
      # 📦 Clone private repo using SSH and verify
      - name: Clone and Verify Private Repo
        run: \|
          git clone git@github.com:ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo-certificates.git ./fakeMatch/
          if [ -d "./fakeMatch/.git" ]; then
            echo "✅ Repo cloned successfully into ./fakeMatch/"
            cd ./fakeMatch
            echo "📌 Current commit: $(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
          else
            echo "❌ Clone failed. SSH Agent may not be configured properly."
            exit 1
          fi
```

You can use the above Action to verify if the setup was successful.

Success. Subsequent `fastlane match` or `pod install` for private pods should work correctly.
