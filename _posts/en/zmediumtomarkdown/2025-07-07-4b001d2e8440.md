#### Introduction

In the previous article "[**CI/CD Practical Guide (2): Comprehensive Guide to Using GitHub Actions and Self-hosted Runners**](../404bd5c70040/)", we introduced the basics of GitHub Actions, its workflow, and how to use your own machine as a Runner. We also implemented three simple automation Actions. **This article will focus on the practical use of GitHub Actions to build an iOS App CI/CD workflow**, guiding you step by step while supplementing your knowledge of GitHub Actions.
### App CI/CD Workflow Diagram

This article will focus on the CI/CD section built with GitHub Actions. The next article "[CI/CD Practical Guide (4): Using Google Apps Script Web App to Connect GitHub Actions for a Free and Easy Packaging Tool Platform](../4273e57e7148/)" will introduce the right half of the diagram, which involves using Google Apps Script Web App to build a cross-team collaboration packaging platform.
#### Workflow Process:
1. GitHub Actions triggers on Pull Request, form submission, or scheduled events
2. Executes corresponding Workflow Jobs/Steps
3. Steps execute corresponding Fastlane (iOS) or (Android Gradle) scripts
4. Fastlane executes corresponding xcodebuild (iOS) commands
5. Obtains execution results
6. Subsequent Workflow Jobs/Steps process results
7. Completion

#### GitHub Actions Results

Let's start with the final results to give you some motivation for implementation!

> **_Let's get started with the implementation!_** 




### Infrastructure Architecture of the iOS Demo Project


[![](https://opengraph.githubassets.com/aae912e865445f1ec806c63abb65a8a4900e177a5c113b1b188caf01df5bb064/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo)](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo){:target="_blank"}


**The iOS project content used in this article includes test items generated by AI**, so there's no need to worry about the details of iOS programming; we will focus on the Infra & CI/CD aspects.

> **_The tools mentioned below are based on past experience; for new projects, consider using the updated [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise){:target="_blank"} and [tuist](https://github.com/tuist/tuist){:target="_blank"}._** 




#### Mint


[![](https://opengraph.githubassets.com/cfba5c7658c860d0ee4e97df8176a3fc6bbfd9f84c2e8334eaa30988c2700d63/yonaskolb/Mint)](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint){:target="_blank"}


The Mint tool helps us manage the versions of dependency tools uniformly (Gemfile can only manage Ruby Gems), such as XCodeGen, SwiftFormat, SwiftLint, Periphery, etc.

**Mintfile:**
```graphql
yonaskolb/Mint@0.17.5
yonaskolb/XcodeGen@2.35.0
nicklockwood/SwiftFormat@0.51.13
```

Here we only use three.

> **_If you find it too complicated, you can skip it and directly install the required tools in the Action Workflow Step using brew install._** 




#### Bundle

**Gemfile:**
```bash
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'cocoapods', '~>1.16.0'
gem 'fastlane', '~>2.228.0'

plugins_path = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'Product', 'fastlane', 'Pluginfile')
eval_gemfile(plugins_path) if File.exist?(plugins_path)
```

Manages Ruby (Gems) related dependencies; the two most commonly used in iOS projects are `cocoapods` and `fastlane`.
#### Cocoapods

**Product/podfile:**
```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo' do
  pod 'SnapKit'
end 
```

Although it has been declared [deprecated](https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Specs-Repo/){:target="_blank"}, Cocoapods is still very common in older iOS projects, so we will add SnapKit as a demo.
#### XCodeGen

To avoid conflicts caused by changes to `.xcodeproj` / `.xcworkspace` during multi-developer collaboration, we use a Project.yaml to define the XCode Project content and generate the project files locally (not pushed to Git).

**Product/project.yaml:**
```yaml
name: app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo
options:
  bundleIdPrefix: com.example
  deploymentTarget:
    iOS: '13.0'
  usesTabs: false
  indentWidth: 2
  tabWidth: 2

  Debug: debug
  Release: release

packages:
  SnapshotTesting:
    url: https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing
    from: 1.18.4
```

SnapshotTesting: Managed using Swift Package Manager.
#### Fastlane

Encapsulates the xcodebuild command, integrates with App Store Connect API, Firebase API, and other services.

**Product/fastlane/Fastfile:**
```php

default_platform(:ios)

platform :ios do
  desc "Run all tests (Unit Tests + UI Tests)"
  lane :run_all_tests do |options|
    device = options[:device]
    scan(
      scheme: "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo",
      device: device,
      clean: true,
      output_directory: "fastlane/test_output",
      output_types: "junit"
    )
  end

  desc "Run only Unit Tests"
  lane :run_unit_tests do |options|
    device = options[:device]
    scan(
      scheme: "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo",
      device: device,
      clean: true,
      only_testing: [
        "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demoTests"
      ],
      output_directory: "fastlane/test_output",
      output_types: "junit"
    )
  end

  desc "Build and upload to Firebase App Distribution"
  lane :beta do |options|
    
    if options[:version_number] && options[:version_number].to_s.strip != ""
      increment_version_number(version_number: options[:version_number])
    end

    if options[:build_number] && options[:build_number].to_s.strip != ""
      increment_build_number(build_number: options[:build_number])
    end

    update_code_signing_settings(
      use_automatic_signing: false,
      path: "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo.xcodeproj",
      team_id: ENV['TEAM_ID'],
      code_sign_identity: "iPhone Developer",
      sdk: "iphoneos*",
      profile_name: "cicd"
    )

    gym(
      scheme: "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo",
      clean: true,
      export_method: "development",
      output_directory: "fastlane/build",
      output_name: "app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo.ipa",
      export_options: {
          provisioningProfiles: {
            "com.test.appcicdgithubactionsdemo" => "cicd",
          },
      }
    )

    firebase_app_distribution(
      app: "1:127683058219:ios:98896929fa131c7a80686e",
      firebase_cli_token: ENV["FIREBASE_CLI_TOKEN"],
      release_notes: options[:release_notes] || "New beta build"
    )
  end
end
```

Note: The provisioningProfiles and profile_name correspond to the [Profiles certificate names in App Developer](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list){:target="_blank"}. (If using match, these specifications are not necessary.)

**Fastlane is an indispensable part of iOS CI/CD**, allowing you to quickly develop the actual execution steps of CI/CD using its encapsulated methods; we only need to focus on the overall script design without dealing with complex API integrations or command writing.

For example: Fastlane only requires writing "scan(xxx)" to execute tests, while writing it as xcodebuild would require " `xcodebuild -workspace ./xxx.xcworkspace -scheme xxx -derivedDataPath xxx ‘platform=iOS Simulator,id=xxx’ clean build test` ", and packaging and deployment would be even more troublesome, requiring integration with App Store Connect/Firebase API, which would involve writing over 10 lines of code just for key validation.

**In our demo project, we only have three lanes:**
- run_all_tests: Run all types of tests (Snapshot + Unit)
- run_unit_tests: Run only unit tests (Unit)
- beta: Package and deploy to Firebase App Distribution

#### Fastlane — Matchfile

Due to the limitations of the demo project, we did not use Match to manage team development and deployment certificates, but it is worth mentioning that it is recommended to use Match to manage all development and deployment certificates for the team for easier control and unified updates.


> _Using Match allows you to directly use commands like `match all` during project setup to install all necessary certificates in one go._

#### Makefile


![Makefile](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*jYACUYFP3MkeHCgeUY7j3w.png)

Makefile

Allows both the development side and CI/CD to use Makefile to execute commands, making it easier to encapsulate the same environment, paths, and operations.


> _A classic case is that some people use the locally installed `pod install`, while others use the Bundler-managed `bundle exec pod install`. If the versions differ, it may lead to discrepancies._ 





> **_If you find it too complicated, you can skip it and just write the commands to be executed directly in the Action Workflow Step._** 





**Makefile:**
```makefile
#!make
PRODUCT_FOLDER = ./Product/
SHELL         := /bin/zsh
.DEFAULT_GOAL := install
MINT_DIRECTORY := ./mint/

export MINT_PATH=$(MINT_DIRECTORY)

## 👇 Help function
.PHONY: help
help:
 @echo ""
 @echo "📖 Available commands:"
 @grep -E '^[a-zA-Z_-]+:.*?## .*$$' $(MAKEFILE_LIST) | \
  awk 'BEGIN {FS = ":.*?## "}; {printf "  \033[36m%-20s\033[0m %s\n", $$1, $$2}'
 @echo ""

## Setup
.PHONY: setup
setup: check-mint ## Install Ruby and Mint dependencies
 @echo "🔨 Installing Ruby dependencies..."
 bundle config set path 'vendor/bundle'
 bundle install
 @echo "🔨 Installing Mint dependencies..."
 mint bootstrap

## Install
.PHONY: install
install: XcodeGen PodInstall ## Execute XcodeGen and CocoaPods installation

.PHONY: XcodeGen
XcodeGen: check-mint ## Generate .xcodeproj using XcodeGen
 @echo "🔨 Execute XcodeGen"
 cd $(PRODUCT_FOLDER) && \
 mint run yonaskolb/XcodeGen --quiet

.PHONY: PodInstall
PodInstall: ## Install CocoaPods dependencies
 @echo "📦 Installing CocoaPods dependencies..."
 cd $(PRODUCT_FOLDER) && \
 bundle exec pod install

### Mint
check-mint: check-brew ## Check if Mint is installed, install automatically if not
 @if ! command -v mint &> /dev/null; then \
  echo "🔨 Installing mint..."; \
  brew install mint; \
 fi

### Brew
check-brew: ## Check if Homebrew is installed, install automatically if not
 @if ! command -v brew &> /dev/null; then \
  echo "🔨 Installing Homebrew..."; \
  /bin/bash -c "$$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"; \
 fi

## Format only git swift files
.PHONY: format
format: check-mint ## Format all Swift files under Product/
 mint run swiftformat $(PRODUCT_FOLDER)
```

To avoid polluting the entire system or other projects, we try to specify the paths of dependency packages (e.g., mint, bundle, etc.) under the project directory (and pair it with `.gitignore` to exclude them).
```scss
├── mint (Mint dependencies)
│   └── packages
├── Product
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo.xcodeproj
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demo.xcworkspace
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demoSnapshotTests
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demoTests
│   ├── app-ci-cd-github-actions-demoUITests
│   ├── fastlane
│   └── Pods (Cocoapods dependencies)
└── vendor (Bundle dependencies)
    └── bundle
```


![make help](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*F1KFntT8bCZzyYm9JahiuA.png)

make help

**Using Makefile for unified project setup steps:**
1. `git clone repo`
2. `cd ./repo`
3. `make setup` 
Install necessary tool dependencies ( **brew**, **mint**, **bundle**, xcodegen, swiftformat,…)
4. `make install` 
Generate the project (execute pod install, xcodegen)
5. Done
6. Open and run the project



> **_Whether for CI/CD or onboarding new team members, follow the above steps to set up the project._** 




### GitHub Actions CI/CD Case Studies

This article will introduce three GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow case studies, which you can refer to for building CI/CD that fits your team's workflow.
1. CI — Execute unit tests on Pull Request
2. CD — Package + deploy to Firebase App Distribution
3. CI + CD — Nightly Build executing snapshot + unit tests + packaging + deploying to Firebase App Distribution



> _Due to demo limitations, this article will only connect to package deployment to Firebase App Distribution. The steps for packaging to TestFlight or the App Store are the same, with the only difference being the scripts in Fastlane, which you can customize._ 




### CI — Execute Unit Tests on Pull Request
#### Process

The Develop branch **cannot be pushed directly**; a Pull Request must be created to update it. All Pull Requests **must pass review and unit tests before merging**, and any new commits pushed will trigger re-testing.
#### CI-Testing.yml

Repo → Actions → New workflow → set up a workflow yourself.
```yaml
# Workflow (Action) name
name: CI-Testing

# Title name in Actions Log
run-name: "[CI-Testing] ${{ github.event.pull_request.title || github.ref }}"

# If there are new Jobs in the same Concurrency Group, the running ones will be canceled
# For example, if a task triggered by a Push Commit hasn't executed yet and another Push Commit occurs, the previous task will be canceled
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event_name }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

```markdown
# Trigger Events

          lfs: false
          
          # If specified, checkout the specified branch; otherwise, use the default (current branch)
          # Since the on: schedule event can only run on the main branch, if we want to do Nightly Build or similar tasks, we need to specify the branch
          # e.g. on: schedule -> main branch, Nightly Build master branch
          ref: ${{ github.event.inputs.BRANCH || '' }}

      # ========== Env Setup Steps ==========

          XCODE_VERSION=$(cat .xcode-version)
          echo "XCODE_VERSION: ${XCODE_VERSION}"
          echo "xcode_version=${XCODE_VERSION}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

          # You can also specify the global XCode version here, so you don't need to specify DEVELOPER_DIR in subsequent steps
          # However, this command requires sudoer privileges; if it's a self-hosted runner, ensure the runner environment has sudo permissions
          # sudo xcode-select -s "/Applications/Xcode_${XCODE_VERSION}.app/Contents/Developer"

      # Read the specified Ruby version for the project
      - name: Read .ruby-version

      # Optional, the reason is that previously when running multiple runners on self-hosted for CI/CD, cocoapods repos are shared directories
      # The problem solved is: there is a very small chance of conflicts occurring when pulling cocoapods repos during simultaneous pod installs (since the default is $HOME/.cocoapods/)
      # GitHub Hosted Runner does not require this setting
      # - name: Change Cocoapods Repos Folder
      #   if: contains(runner.labels, 'self-hosted')
      #   run: |
      #     # Each Runner uses its own .cocoapods folder to prevent resource conflicts

      #     rm -f "$HOME/.cocoapods-${{ env.RUNNER_NAME }}/repos/cocoapods/.git/index.lock"

      # ========== Cache Setting Steps ==========
      # Note that even for self-hosted, Cache is currently Cloud Cache and will count towards usage
      # Rules: Automatically deleted after 7 days of no hits, single Cache limit of 10 GB, Cache only on successful Action
      # Public Repo: Free and unlimited
      # Private Repo: Starting from 5 GB
      # Self-hosted can write Cache & Restore strategies using shell scripts or use other tools for assistance

**Technical Highlights:**
- runs-on: It is recommended to use a self-hosted Runner, [GitHub Hosted Runner macOS is very expensive](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/about-billing-for-github-actions#per-minute-rates){:target="_blank"}.
- Manually read the `.xcode-version` file to obtain the specified XCode version and set the `DEVELOPER_DIR` env in steps that require specifying XCode, allowing easy switching without Sudo.
- Cache: Can speed up dependency installation, but note that even for self-hosted Runners, GitHub Cloud Cache is still used and subject to billing limits.
- Using `set +e` allows command execution failures not to exit immediately + outputs everything to a file + reads the file to determine if it's Build Failed or Test Failed; otherwise, the messages will uniformly indicate Test Failed.
  This can also be extended to identify other errors, such as: `Underlying Error: Unable to boot the Simulator.` indicating simulator startup failure, prompting a retry.
- Checkout Code can accept specified branches: Since the `on: schedule` event can only trigger on the main (Default Branch), if we want to schedule operations on another branch, we need to specify the branch.
- Specifying the .cocoapods Repo path is optional; previously, there were issues with two Runners on the same self-hosted machine getting stuck on pod install due to both operating on the .cocoapods Repo, causing a git lock.
  (But the probability is very low.)
- **If you have a Private Pods Repo that needs to be cloned, refer to this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57612428/cloning-private-github-repository-within-organisation-in-actions){:target="_blank"} to set up SSH Agent for cloning permissions.**
- Remember to add the following variables in Repo -> Settings -> Actions secrets and variables:
  `SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION` for the simulator iOS version
  `SIMULATOR_NAME` for the simulator name

- Ruleset Name: Ruleset Name
- Enforcement status: Enable/Disable this rule restriction
- Target branches: Target Base branches; setting Default Branch means all branches intended to merge into main or develop are subject to this rule
- Bypass list: Specify special identities or Teams that can bypass this restriction
- Branch rules:

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*Hzd9CCTsu18kyDR1goRWag.png)

- Restrict deletions: Prohibit branch deletion
- Require a pull request before merging: Can only merge through PR
- Required approvals: Limit the number of approvals needed
- Require status checks to pass: Limit which checks must pass to merge
Click \+ Add checks, enter `Testing`, and select the one with the GitHub Actions logo.
**There is a small issue here; if Suggestions** **cannot find `Testing`, you need to go back to Actions and trigger it (try opening a PR) successfully once for it to appear here.**

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*MRPwUEVVbbz8nH0sS2hFfQ.png)

- Block force pushes: Prohibit force pushes

After saving and confirming that the Enforcement status is Active, the rules will take effect.

**Once everything is set up, open a PR to test it out:**

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*iPETBWx6Boq12rY1fHXmuQ.png)

- Checks show CI-Testing ( **Required** ), Merging is blocked, At least X approving review is required by reviewers with write access. This indicates successful setup.

**If the project build fails (Build Failed), it will comment:**

#### Technical Details — Obtaining & Setting Firebase CLI Token

Follow the steps in the [Firebase official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli?hl=zh-tw#install-cli-mac-linux){:target="_blank"}:

First, install the Firebase CLI tool:
```bash
curl -sL https://firebase.tools | bash
```

Run:
```bash
firebase login:ci
```

Complete the login and authorization:

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*Jex5aYzRSs7Trfx6z_e1Aw.png)

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*S-1ckn9WC6j0DIqZGSdUUg.png)

Return to the Terminal and copy the Firebase CLI Token:

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*sa_h8L08JbeC2nA0kACQtQ.png)

Go to Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a Secret: `FIREBASE_CLI_TOKEN` and paste the Firebase CLI Token.

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*Lc6yGPu7L_0z6u1HH2PB5A.png)

> **_This Token = your login identity_** _Please keep it safe; if the account is no longer in use, it needs to be changed._

#### Technical Details — Install the Apple certificate and provisioning profile

Supplementary details on importing development certificates into the Runner.

Since GitHub Actions Secrets cannot store files, all certificate files must first be converted to Base64 Encoded text format and stored in Secrets. The GitHub Actions Step will then dynamically read them, write them to TEMP files, and move them to the correct location for the system to read and use.

**Packaging Development requires two key certificates:**
- [Provision Profile (\ .mobileprovision)](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list){:target="_blank"}
- [Development Certificate (\ .p12)](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list){:target="_blank"}

![cicd\.mobileprovision](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*WXqqnErto3nn8rnNg6TXgw.png)

cicd\.mobileprovision

![development\.cer](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*RkeZ1PkXeY9Nt1kSRJKEQw.png)

development\.cer

The Certificate downloaded from [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list){:target="_blank"} is in \ .cer format, but we need it in \ .p12 format. You can double-click the downloaded \ .cer to install it in Keychain, then right-click the certificate in Keychain and select Export.

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*HJMxwM3IDjxT-UGqnoUtWw.png)

File name: cicd\.p12, format \ .p12

P12 key password: Enter a secure custom string (using `123456` as an example is not a good practice).

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*tyH0XqDVPGPWFJPL4dxksw.png)

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*qKeZWel3w_5wW7meMtHmLA.png)

**Now both files: cicd\.p12 and cicd\.mobileprovision are ready.**

**Convert to BASE64 format string and store it in Repo Secrets:**
```bash
base64 -i cicd.mobileprovision | pbcopy
```

Go to Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a Secret: `BUILD_PROVISION_PROFILE_BASE64` and paste the above content.

\-
```bash
base64 -i cicd.p12 | pbcopy
```

Go to Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a Secret: `BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` and paste the above content.

\-
Go to Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a Secret: `P12_PASSWORD` with the password you set when exporting the P12 key.

\-
Go to Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a Secret: `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`:
If it is a GitHub Hosted Runner, you can enter any arbitrary string. **If it is a Self-hosted Runner, it should be the login password of the macOS Runner user.**

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*JZCkFUJCQsggqYtW8acjTw.png)

#### Technical Details — App Store Connect API Key

Fastlane packaging and deployment to the App Store and TestFlight [requires the \ .json key](https://docs.fastlane.tools/app-store-connect-api/){:target="_blank"}. Similarly, due to GitHub Actions Secrets being limited to storing strings and not files, we also need to convert the key content into a Base64 string. The GitHub Actions Step will then dynamically read it, write it to a TEMP file, and provide the file path for Fastlane to reference.

**First, go to [App Store Connect to create & download the App Store Connect API Key](../f1365e51902c/) (\ .p8):**
```vbnet
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
sss
axzzvcxz
zxzvzcxv
vzxcvzxvczxcvz
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Create a new `app_store_connect_api.json` file \( [refer to content](https://docs.fastlane.tools/app-store-connect-api/){:target="_blank"} \):
```bash
{
  "key_id": "Key ID written on App Store Connect",
  "issuer_id": "Issuer ID written on App Store Connect",
  "key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- remember to replace newlines with\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----",
  "duration": 1200, # optional (maximum 1200)
  "in_house": false # optional but may be required if using match/sigh
}
```

After saving the file, run:
```bash
base64 -i app_store_connect_api.json | pbcopy
```

Paste the string content into Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Add a Secret: `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_BASE64` and paste the above content.

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*QxRuxEPEfWbJ383hhnxGkA.png)

After the `Read and Write Apple Store Connect API Key to Temp` Step is completed, in subsequent Steps, just pass in the env `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH`:
```yaml
- name: Deploy
  env:
    APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH: "${{ runner.temp }}/${{ env.APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_FILE_NAME }}"
  run: |
    ....
```

Fastlane will automatically retrieve and use it.
#### Technical Extension — Reuse Action Workflow to Split Packaging and Deployment Actions

In this case, we directly use Fastlane's `beta` Lane to execute both packaging and deployment actions.

In practical scenarios, we may need to deploy the same package results to different platforms (Firebase, TestFlight, etc.), so a better practice is to have packaging as one Action and deployment as another Action, to avoid running packaging twice; this also aligns better with CI/CD's division of responsibilities.

#### GitHub Actions — Artifact

Similar to Cache, even with Self-hosted Runner, the Artifact feature still operates through GitHub Cloud and is subject to usage limits \( [free account starts at 500MB](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/about-billing-for-github-actions#included-storage-and-minutes){:target="_blank"} \).

> _Self-hosted Runner can achieve similar effects by creating shared host directories or using other tools as alternatives._

Currently, I only use Artifact to store small data, such as Snapshot Tests' error results, test reports, etc.
### CI— Nightly Build Running Snapshot + Unit Tests + Packaging + CD Deployment to Firebase App Distribution
#### Process

Every day at 3 AM, all tests (unit + snapshot tests) are automatically run against the main (develop or master) branch. If they fail, a failure notification is sent to the Slack workgroup; if successful, a version is packaged and deployed to Firebase App Distribution, with success/failure notifications sent to Slack.

We can directly install the Nightly Build version on our mobile phones for an early experience test.
#### Technical Details

This Action reuses the previously designed CI-Testing and CD-Deploy to create our Nightly Build, which is very flexible and easy to use!

**Complete Code: [CI-Nightly-Build-And-Deploy.yml](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/actions/workflows/CI-Nightly-Build-And-Deploy.yml){:target="_blank"}**
### Self-hosted Runner Considerations

This article is based on a Public Repo, so we directly use GitHub Hosted macOS Runner. However, in actual work, our Repo will definitely be Private, and using GitHub Hosted Runner is very expensive (you could buy a Mac Mini for the cost of a month and run it comfortably in the office), and each machine can run multiple Runners concurrently based on performance.

> **_For details, refer to the [previous article](../404bd5c70040/) " [Building and Switching to Self-hosted Runner](../404bd5c70040/) " section_** _After installing XCode and the basic environment on your local computer, register and enable the Runner, and change `runs-on` in the Action Workflow YAML to `[self-hosted]`._

The issue of multiple Runners on the same computer has mostly been resolved in the Actions above, such as changing all shared dependency directories to local directories. There is also a testing issue to solve, which is the simulator conflict: "**When two test Jobs are run by two Runners on the same machine simultaneously, if they specify the same simulator, they will interfere with each other, causing the tests to fail.**"

The solution is simple: set a separate simulator for each Runner.
#### Simulator Configuration for Multiple Runners on the Same Machine

Assuming I have **two Runners on the same computer** receiving tasks in parallel:
- `ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-A`
- `ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-B`

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*3ptg9Tl5fBbEIYB4kgh0kw.png)

In the XCode simulator settings, we need to add two simulators:

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*k9bR2C12Wk11HAKKiYJ2zg.png)

![](/assets/4b001d2e8440/1*iigArewZEW0063Q6xwZn7g.png)

- Model and iOS version should match the testing environment.

**Change the testing steps in CI-Testing.yml to:**
```bash
# Run Fastlane Unit Test Lane
      - name: Run Tests
        id: testing
        # Specify the working directory, so subsequent commands don't need to cd ./Product/
        working-directory: ./Product/
        env:
          # ...
          # Repo -> Settings -> Actions secrets and variables -> variables
          # iOS version of the simulator
          SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION: ${{ vars.SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION }}

          # Current Runner name
          RUNNER_NAME: ${{ runner.name }}
          
          # ...
        run: |

          # ...
          bundle exec fastlane ${TEST_LANE} device:"${RUNNER_NAME} (${SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION})" | tee "$RUNNER_TEMP/testing_output.txt"
          # ...
```
- Change `device` to `${RUNNER_NAME} (${SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION})`
- `SIMULATOR_IOS_VERSION` should still refer to the Repo variables.

**The combined result will be (using 18.4 as an example):**
- Runner: `ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-A` 
Simulator: **ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-A(18.4)**
- Runner: `ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-B` 
Simulator: **ZhgChgLideMacBook-Pro-Runner-B(18.4)**

This way, when both Runners are executing tests simultaneously, they will each run their own simulators independently.
