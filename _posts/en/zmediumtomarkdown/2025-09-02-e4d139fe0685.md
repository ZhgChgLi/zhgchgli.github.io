[This is](https://corp.linebank.com.tw/news/87ce77b7-a474-46a8-b00b-a9b1503550a2){:target="_blank"} the biggest incentive for using LINE Bank. Until the end of 2025, depositing funds to Firstrade with a LINE Bank account only incurs a 150 TWD fee, with no telegraphic transfer or other charges.

### LINE Bank Transfer Deposit Firstrade Progress Inquiry

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*nEUD0C8nOO1E2uS9p6u8rw.png)

You can find the foreign currency transfer notification in the top right corner of the LINE Bank App. Click it to check the transfer progress.

- On non-holidays, the transfer can be completed as early as the same day. On holidays, it will be processed on the next working day after two days.

- **If the beneficiary information is incorrect, the payment will be rejected, and you will need to pay a return fee to resend the transfer**

#### Apply for Remittance Slip (Transaction Record/Receipt)

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*EH8g25Pxoewchc5gt7qK_w.jpeg)

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*DMrWpw9JdcFVOYuEWgNmkw.png)

Line Bank App progress inquiry notification (as mentioned above), scroll down to find the "Request Receipt/Transaction Certificate" button. Clicking it will send the remittance slip to your email, which you can open using your ID number.

#### The receiving bank has received the funds, but Firstrade hasn't seen the money?

This is normal. Although the remittance status on Line Bank shows "Receiving bank has received the funds" and the transfer is complete, Firstrade still needs to wait for a U.S. business day (time) to confirm the funds.

As shown in the image above, although the funds were received on 8/27 at 09:00 AM, Firstrade only confirmed the funds and sent the deposit notification email on 8/28 at 02:10 AM:

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*7g0qrnxcoE5aYYz0erJrpw.png)

### Line Bank Account Upgrade and Binding Designated Account Tutorial

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*ZbYDlcVZlCEE4fdKgeaWWQ.png)

**Benefit Comparison:**

- (After account opening) Basic account: maximum NT$10,000 per transaction, NT$30,000 per day, NT$50,000 per month.

- (After customer service video call) Upgraded account: single transaction limit NT$50,000, daily limit NT$100,000, monthly limit NT$200,000.

- (After Natural Person Certificate + Customer Service Video) Designated Account: maximum single transaction limit of NT$500,000.

#### Line Bank Account Upgrade

It's actually just upgrading to the basic limit of other banks. **(This step does not require a Citizen Digital Certificate.)**

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*aFqGx67be74ZZr75wUvT-w.png)

Open the LINE Bank App, scroll down under "More" to find "Others" → "Account Upgrade," select the type of account to upgrade → choose **2. Video Verification "Start Verification >".**

- Please ensure your internet connection is stable and working properly.

- Ensure video call is currently available

Clicking will start a video call with customer service. You will need to have a video conversation with them, and they may verify your account information (e.g., ask about your current balance). Once confirmed, your account upgrade will be complete.

### Set Up Firstrade Remittance Account

It is recommended to directly set the Firstrade remittance account as a designated account for convenience, speed, and security.

- The designated account will take 2 days to become effective.

- The designated account requires prior verification with a Citizen Digital Certificate.

- **Citizen Digital Certificate verification only supports cards starting with TP07, which contain an NFC chip**

#### Applying for a Citizen Digital Certificate

Please first complete the online [Natural Person Application Form](https://moica.nat.gov.tw/rac_form.html){:target="_blank"}:

![[Natural Person Application Form](https://moica.nat.gov.tw/rac_form.html){:target="_blank"}](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*4xi8pHeUNAPZKijWiXfj1Q.png)

[Natural Person Application Form](https://moica.nat.gov.tw/rac_form.html){:target="_blank"}

After submission, you can complete the process at any household registration office counter within 7 days (it does not have to be your registered residence).

- On-site processing and on-site issuance

- Few people apply for the Citizen Digital Certificate at the Household Registration Office, and they usually remain open during lunch hours.

#### Add a Designated Firstrade Overseas Remittance Account in Line Bank

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*Mi9tRTDMpubsVfWF6AXidg.png)

Open the LINE Bank App → "More" → Scroll down to find Foreign Exchange, tap "My Remittance Records" → "Remittance Designated Account" → "Add Designated Account".

#### First Time Use — Complete Account Verification

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*nLPxsTJ1ALuv4hLZPcdqmw.jpeg)

The first binding requires completing both "Citizen Digital Certificate Verification" and "Video Verification." Video verification, along with account upgrading, must be done via video call with customer service to verify account information.

**For the Citizen Digital Certificate, you need to use the newly issued certificate card and complete the verification by tapping the card:**

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*-N0scmyLMlqgPHbuDpmD-Q.png)

> *The NFC range of the Citizen Digital Certificate is quite short. I had to try several times before it worked; on iPhone, place the camera near the center of the card and move the card slightly left and right. After a few attempts, the verification will succeed.*

#### Add a Designated Account

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*RvHTvjTzjap4M09RG5Q8xQ.png)

Enter the account information as introduced in the previous section on remittance details. After confirming everything is correct, click "Next."

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*2VbwWyl9zQCY9p2fVVoL2w.png)

You need to complete two-factor SMS verification by switching to the newly received message and entering the four-digit code; wait about 1–2 minutes until you receive a confirmation message indicating the verification is successful.

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*WmXzGCmOWMkOxwMhYJ-mfQ.png)

After successful verification, the designated account will be added successfully!

- After just adding, an exclamation mark will appear at the top right corner, indicating it is not yet effective.

- **Takes effect after 2 days.**

#### Line Bank Firstrade Designated Account Transfer

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*TfcH3RFr1wR7XKjKjqnvJQ.png)

"My Transfer Records" → "Agreed Transfer Account" → Select Account → Enter Amount → Choose "Transfer Using Agreed Account" → All information will be filled automatically.
