### Step-by-Step Guide — LINE Bank Deposit to Firstrade Fast Credit, Only 150 TWD Fee, and Account Upgrade / Auto Transfer / Fee Reimbursement Application Tutorial

Line Bank Deposit to Firstrade and Account Upgrade Agreement with Fee Reimbursement Complete Illustrated Guide

### Advantages of LINE Bank

#### Until 2025/12/31 — US remittance fee only 150 NTD

[This is](https://corp.linebank.com.tw/news/87ce77b7-a474-46a8-b00b-a9b1503550a2){:target="_blank"} the biggest incentive for using LINE Bank. Until the end of 2025, depositing funds to Firstrade with a LINE Bank account only costs a 150 TWD fee, with no telegraphic transfer or other fees.

[Click here to apply](https://www.linebank.com.tw/R/mgm-portal?campaignId=2&uid=bfQqph){:target="_blank"}

#### Disadvantages

This time, I needed to set up a designated account. Since LINE Bank has no physical branches, verification can only be done via the Citizen Digital Certificate. This means I had to visit the household registration office to apply for the certificate before using the service, which is more troublesome than going directly to a bank.

### Advantages of Firstrade

- Easy account opening, simple interface and features, beginner-friendly for US stock investors

- Supports Chinese interface

- 0 Commission Trading

- Established Broker

### LINE Bank Remittance Deposit Firstrade Progress Inquiry

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*nEUD0C8nOO1E2uS9p6u8rw.png)

You can find the foreign currency remittance notification in the top right corner of the LINE Bank App. Click to view the remittance progress.

- On non-holidays, the transfer can be completed as fast as the same day. On holidays, it will be processed on the next business day after two days.

- **If the recipient information is incorrect, the receiving party will reject the payment, and you will need to pay a return transfer fee to resend the remittance.**

#### Apply for Remittance Slip (Transaction Record/Receipt)

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*EH8g25Pxoewchc5gt7qK_w.jpeg)

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*DMrWpw9JdcFVOYuEWgNmkw.png)

Line Bank App progress notification (as mentioned earlier) has a "Request Remittance Slip/Transaction Certificate" button at the bottom. Clicking it will send the remittance slip to your email, which you can open using your ID number.

#### The receiving bank has received the funds, but Firstrade hasn't seen the money?

This is normal. Although the remittance status on Line Bank shows "Beneficiary bank has received the funds" and the transfer is complete, Firstrade still needs to wait for a U.S. business day (time) to confirm the funds.

As shown in the above image, although the funds were received at 8/27 AM 09:00, Firstrade only confirmed the funds at 8/28 AM 02:10 and sent the deposit notification email:

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*7g0qrnxcoE5aYYz0erJrpw.png)

At this point, log in to Firstrade to see the funds credited, and you can start trading U.S. stocks:

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*83_EXDsxQpwqgfmkHogYbw.png)

"My Account" → "Account Records" also allows you to check deposit records.

### Line Bank Account Upgrade and Binding Designated Account Tutorial

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*ZbYDlcVZlCEE4fdKgeaWWQ.png)

**Benefit Comparison:**

- (Benefits after account opening) Basic account: maximum NT$10,000 per transaction, NT$30,000 per day, NT$50,000 per month.

- (After customer service video call) Account upgrade: maximum NT$50,000 per transaction, NT$100,000 per day, NT$200,000 per month.

- (After natural person certificate + customer service video verification) Designated account: single transaction limit up to 500,000.

#### Line Bank Account Upgrade

This is simply an upgrade to the basic transfer limit for other banks. **(This step does not require a Citizen Digital Certificate.)**

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*aFqGx67be74ZZr75wUvT-w.png)

Open the LINE Bank App, scroll down under "More" to find "Others" → "Account Upgrade," select the type of account to upgrade → choose **2. Video Verification "Start Verification >".**

- Please ensure your internet connection is stable and working properly.

- Ensure video call is available now

Clicking will start a video call with customer service. You will need to have a video conversation with the representative, who may verify your account information (e.g., ask about your current balance). Once confirmed, your account upgrade will be complete.

### Designate Firstrade Remittance Account

It is recommended to directly set the Firstrade remittance account as a designated account for convenience, speed, and security.

- The designated account will take effect after 2 days.

- The designated account requires prior verification with a Citizen Digital Certificate.

- **Citizen digital certificate verification only supports cards starting with TP07, which have an NFC chip**

#### Applying for a Citizen Digital Certificate

First, complete the online [Natural Person Application Form](https://moica.nat.gov.tw/rac_form.html){:target="_blank"}:

![[Natural Person Application Form](https://moica.nat.gov.tw/rac_form.html){:target="_blank"}](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*4xi8pHeUNAPZKijWiXfj1Q.png)

[Natural Person Application Form](https://moica.nat.gov.tw/rac_form.html){:target="_blank"}

After submission, you can complete the process at any household registration office counter within 7 days (it does not have to be your registered household location).

- **Processing Fee: $250 NTD**

- On-site application and on-site issuance

- Few people apply for the Citizen Digital Certificate at the Household Registration Office, which usually remains open during lunch hours.

#### Line Bank Add Designated Firstrade Overseas Remittance Account

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*Mi9tRTDMpubsVfWF6AXidg.png)

Open the LINE Bank App → "More" → scroll down to Foreign Exchange, tap "My Remittance Records" → "Remittance Designated Account" → "Add Designated Account".

#### First Time Use — Complete Account Verification

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*nLPxsTJ1ALuv4hLZPcdqmw.jpeg)

The first-time binding requires completing the "Citizen Digital Certificate Verification" and "Video Verification." The video verification, along with account upgrading, must be done via video call with customer service to verify account information.

**For the Citizen Digital Certificate, you need to use the newly issued certificate card and complete the card-based verification:**

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*-N0scmyLMlqgPHbuDpmD-Q.png)

> *The NFC range of the Citizen Digital Certificate is quite small. I retried several times before succeeding; on iPhone, hold the camera near the center of the card and move the card slightly left and right. After a few attempts, the verification will succeed.*

#### Add a Designated Account

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*RvHTvjTzjap4M09RG5Q8xQ.png)

Fill in the account information as introduced earlier in the remittance details. After confirming all information is correct, click "Next."

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*2VbwWyl9zQCY9p2fVVoL2w.png)

You need to complete two-factor SMS verification by entering the four-digit code from the SMS you just received; wait about 1–2 minutes until you receive a confirmation SMS indicating the verification is successful.

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*WmXzGCmOWMkOxwMhYJ-mfQ.png)

After successful verification, the designated account will be added successfully!

- After adding, an exclamation mark will appear in the top right corner, indicating it is not yet effective.

- **Takes effect after 2 days.**

#### Line Bank Firstrade Designated Account Remittance

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*TfcH3RFr1wR7XKjKjqnvJQ.png)

"My Transfer Records" → "Agreed Transfer Account" → Select Account → Enter Amount → Choose "Transfer Using Agreed Account" → All information will be filled automatically.

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*-KOs-E0FQ_Wy80GLl581OA.png)

**Select Remittance Record Data:**

- Remittance fee charged by financial institutions: `25`

Click "Submit" → "Confirm" to complete the application.

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*RYYu26VBBJhxT76Ht1toMQ.png)

You can expect to receive the remittance subsidy in about 2–3 business days.

![](/assets/e4d139fe0685/1*L-g13ZQ2uS2PqHRyomDD4g.png)

You can check the fee subsidy records under "My Account" → "Account Records."

> *Firstrade may experience a brief delay of about one day: the application status disappears, and the account record does not show the subsidy; the deposit record appears about one day later!*

> ***Although LINE Bank only charges us TWD $150, the actual remittance fee exceeds USD $25, so we still subsidize USD $25.***
