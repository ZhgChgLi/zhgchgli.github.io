First, here is the result image, which shows weekly queries of Crashlytics crash logs; filtering out the top 10 issues with the most crashes; sending messages to the Slack Channel, making it easier for all iOS team members to quickly understand the current stability.
### Issues

For app developers, the Crash-Free Rate can be considered the most important metric; the data represents the proportion of app users who **did not encounter** crashes. I believe that regardless of the app, everyone should hope for a Crash-Free Rate of approximately 99.9%; however, in reality, this is impossible. As long as there is programming, bugs can occur, especially since some crash issues are caused by underlying (Apple) or third-party SDKs. Additionally, as DAU (Daily Active Users) varies, it will also have a certain impact on the Crash-Free Rate; the higher the DAU, the more likely it is to encounter various sporadic crash issues.

Since there is no app that is 100% crash-free, tracking and handling crashes becomes very important. Besides the most common [Google Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/products/crashlytics){:target="_blank"} (formerly Fabric), there are actually other options like [Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Bugfender](https://bugfender.com/){:target="_blank"}... I haven't actually compared these tools, so interested friends can research them on their own; if you use other tools, you won't be able to utilize the content introduced in this article.
#### Crashlytics

**The benefits of choosing Crashlytics include:**
- Stable, backed by Google
- Free, easy and quick to install
- In addition to crashes, can also log error events (EX: Decode Error)
- A complete Firebase suite: other services include Google Analytics, Realtime Database, Remote Config, Authentication, Cloud Messaging, Cloud Storage…



> _As a side note: It is not recommended to build a formal service entirely on Firebase, as the costs can become very high once traffic increases... it's a concept of "feeding the beast."_

**Crashlytics also has many drawbacks:**
- Crashlytics does not provide an API to query crash data
- Crashlytics only stores crash logs for the past 90 days
- Crashlytics's integrations support and flexibility are extremely poor


The most painful aspect is the extremely poor support and flexibility for integrations, combined with the lack of an API to write scripts for crash data; one can only rely on manually checking Crashlytics for crash logs from time to time to track crash issues.
#### **Integrations Supported by Crashlytics:**
1. \[Email Notification\] — Trending stability issues (crash problems encountered by more and more users)
2. \[Slack, Email Notification\] — New Fatal Issue (crash issues)
3. \[Slack, Email Notification\] — New Non-Fatal Issue (non-crash issues)
4. \[Slack, Email Notification\] — Velocity Alert (sudden increase in crash issues)
5. \[Slack, Email Notification\] — Regression Alert (issues that have been solved but reappear)
6. Crashlytics to Jira issue

The content and rules of the above Integrations cannot be customized.

Initially, we directly used 2. New Fatal Issue to Slack or Email, and for Email, it would trigger the [Google Apps Script for subsequent processing scripts](../d414bdbdb8c9/); however, this notification would flood the notification channel because it would notify for every issue, big or small, including sporadic crashes caused by user devices or iOS itself. As DAU grows, we are bombarded with these notifications daily, and among them, only about 10% are truly valuable notifications related to our program errors.

This has not resolved the issue of Crashlytics being difficult to track automatically, and we still spend a lot of time reviewing whether this issue is significant or not.
### Crashlytics + Big Query

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*ABFLOY1AEKkSJah6EVJEkg.png)

After going around in circles, I only found this method, and the official documentation only provides this method; this is the trap under the guise of free offerings. I guess neither Crashlytics nor Analytics Event will provide or plan to launch an API for users to query data; the only official suggestion is to import the data into Big Query for use, and exceeding the free storage and query limits in Big Query incurs charges.

> _Storage: The first 10 GB per month is free._

> _Query: The first 1 TB per month is free. (The query limit refers to how much data capacity is processed when executing a Select statement.)_

> _For more details, please refer to the Big Query pricing documentation._

The setup details for Crashlytics to Big Query can be found in the [**official documentation**](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/bigquery-export){:target="_blank"}, which requires enabling GCP services, binding a credit card, etc.
### Getting Started with Big Query to Query Crashlytics Logs

Once the Crashlytics Log to Big Query import cycle is set up and the first import has data, we can start querying the data.

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*dvjnubHWwYF7Bhz8SiuuLA.jpeg)

First, go to Firebase project -> Crashlytics -> click on the "•••" in the upper right corner -> click to go to "BigQuery dataset."

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*TEJY6kH9guplY1kZvOfxzw.jpeg)

After going to GCP -> Big Query, you can select "firebase_crashlytics" in the left "Explorer" -> choose your Table name -> "Detail" -> on the right, you can view Table information, including the latest modification time, used capacity, storage duration, etc.

> _Confirm that there is data available for querying._

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*4atxy5aRHkQrVvRE1GE2AQ.jpeg)

The upper tab can be switched to "SCHEMA" to view the column information of the Table or refer to the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/bigquery-export#without_stack_traces){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*K0got1UinY2y4cFxZ2HM3w.jpeg)

Clicking the "Query" button in the upper right corner opens an interface with an assisted SQL Builder (recommended for those unfamiliar with SQL):

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*fxget7SOAb7hlnKDWhvmFQ.jpeg)

Or directly click "COMPOSE NEW QUERY" to open a blank Query Editor:

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*3T7vHuR4LoojnZ5xe6LWfg.png)

Regardless of the method, it is the same text editor; after entering the SQL, you can automatically check the SQL syntax and the estimated query cost in the upper right corner (`This query will process XXX when run.`):

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*wGMkfqGPg277BzuUgOag1w.jpeg)

After confirming the query, click "RUN" in the upper left corner to execute the query, and the results will be displayed in the Query results section below.

> **_⚠️ After clicking "RUN" to execute the query, it will accumulate towards the query limit, and charges will apply; so please be careful not to run queries indiscriminately._**

```markdown
#### **If you are unfamiliar with SQL, you can first understand the basic usage and then refer to the Crashlytics [official example for modification](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/bigquery-export){:target="_blank"}:**

**1. Count the number of crashes per day for the last 30 days:**
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT event_id) AS number_of_crashes,
  FORMAT_TIMESTAMP("%F", event_timestamp) AS date_of_crashes
FROM
 `yourProjectID.firebase_crashlytics.yourTableName`
GROUP BY
  date_of_crashes
ORDER BY
  date_of_crashes DESC
LIMIT 30;
```

**2. Query the TOP 10 crashes that occurred most frequently in the last 7 days:**
```sql
SELECT
  DISTINCT issue_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT event_id) AS number_of_crashes,
  COUNT(DISTINCT installation_uuid) AS number_of_impacted_user,
  blame_frame.file,
  blame_frame.line
FROM
  `yourProjectID.firebase_crashlytics.yourTableName`
WHERE
  event_timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(),INTERVAL 168 HOUR)
  AND event_timestamp < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
GROUP BY
  issue_id,
  blame_frame.file,
  blame_frame.line
ORDER BY
  number_of_crashes DESC
LIMIT 10;
```


> _However, the data retrieved using this official example may not match the order seen in Crashlytics, likely due to grouping by blame_frame.file (nullable) and blame_frame.line (nullable)._ 

**3. Query the 10 most frequently crashing devices in the last 7 days:**
```sql
SELECT
  device.model,
COUNT(DISTINCT event_id) AS number_of_crashes
FROM
  `yourProjectID.firebase_crashlytics.yourTableName`
WHERE
  event_timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 168 HOUR)
  AND event_timestamp < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
GROUP BY
  device.model
ORDER BY
  number_of_crashes DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

For more examples, please refer to the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/bigquery-export#example_4_filter_by_custom_key){:target="_blank"}.

> _If your SQL query returns no data, please ensure that the specified Crashlytics data has been imported into BigQuery (for example, the default SQL example queries the crash records for the day, but the data may not have been synchronized yet, resulting in no results); if you confirm there is data, then check if the filtering conditions are correct._ 

#### Top 10 Crashlytics Issue Big Query SQL

Here, we modify the official example from point 2. We want the results to match the crash issues and order we see on the first page of Crashlytics.

**Top 10 crash issues in the last 7 days:**
```sql
SELECT 
  DISTINCT issue_id, 
  issue_title, 
  issue_subtitle, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT event_id) AS number_of_crashes, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT installation_uuid) AS number_of_impacted_user 
FROM 
  `yourProjectID.firebase_crashlytics.yourTableName`
WHERE 
  is_fatal = true 
  AND event_timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), 
    INTERVAL 7 DAY
  ) 
GROUP BY 
  issue_id, 
  issue_title, 
  issue_subtitle 
ORDER BY 
  number_of_crashes DESC 
LIMIT 
  10;
```

```markdown

The comparison of the top 10 crash issues in Crashlytics is consistent ✅.
### Use Google Apps Script to regularly query & forward to Slack

Go to [Google Apps Script homepage](https://script.google.com/home){:target="_blank"} \-&gt; Log in with the same account as Big Query \-&gt; Click on the top left "New Project", after opening a new project, you can rename the project in the top left corner.
#### First, let's complete the integration with Big Query to obtain query data:

Refer to the [official documentation](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/advanced/bigquery){:target="_blank"} example, and incorporate the above Query SQL.
```javascript
function queryiOSTop10Crashes() {
  var request = {
    query: 'SELECT DISTINCT issue_id, issue_title, issue_subtitle, COUNT(DISTINCT event_id) AS number_of_crashes, COUNT(DISTINCT installation_uuid) AS number_of_impacted_user FROM `firebase_crashlytics.你的TableName` WHERE is_fatal = true AND event_timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB( CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 7 DAY ) GROUP BY issue_id, issue_title, issue_subtitle ORDER BY number_of_crashes DESC LIMIT 10;',
    useLegacySql: false
  };
  var queryResults = BigQuery.Jobs.query(request, '你的ProjectID');
  var jobId = queryResults.jobReference.jobId;

  // Check on status of the Query Job.
  var sleepTimeMs = 500;
  while (!queryResults.jobComplete) {
    Utilities.sleep(sleepTimeMs);
    sleepTimeMs *= 2;
    queryResults = BigQuery.Jobs.getQueryResults(projectId, jobId);
  }

  // Get all the rows of results.
  var rows = queryResults.rows;
  while (queryResults.pageToken) {
    queryResults = BigQuery.Jobs.getQueryResults(projectId, jobId, {
      pageToken: queryResults.pageToken
    });
    Logger.log(queryResults.rows);
    rows = rows.concat(queryResults.rows);
  }

  var data = new Array(rows.length);
  for (var i = 0; i < rows.length; i++) {
    var cols = rows[i].f;
    data[i] = new Array(cols.length);
    for (var j = 0; j < cols.length; j++) {
      data[i][j] = cols[j].v;
    }
  }

  return data
}
```

**Query:** The number of meals can be replaced with any pre-written Query SQL.

**The structure of the returned object is as follows:**
```json

#### Add Function to Forward to Slack:

Continue to add a new function below the above code.
```javascript
function sendTop10CrashToSlack() {

  var iOSTop10Crashes = queryiOSTop10Crashes();
  var top10Tasks = new Array();
  
  for (var i = 0; i < iOSTop10Crashes.length ; i++) {
    var issue_id = iOSTop10Crashes[i][0];
    var issue_title = iOSTop10Crashes[i][1];
    var issue_subtitle = iOSTop10Crashes[i][2];
    var number_of_crashes = iOSTop10Crashes[i][3];
    var number_of_impacted_user = iOSTop10Crashes[i][4];

    var strip_title = issue_title.replace(/[\<|\>]/g, '');
    var strip_subtitle = issue_subtitle.replace(/[\<|\>]/g, '');
    
    top10Tasks.push("<https://console.firebase.google.com/u/1/project/你的ProjectID/crashlytics/app/你的專案ID/issues/"+issue_id+"|"+(i+1)+". Crash: "+number_of_crashes+" times ("+number_of_impacted_user+" users) - "+strip_title+" "+strip_subtitle+">");

#### Testing & Scheduling

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*epwnVrltY7ei8_osPnbaww.jpeg)

At this point, your Google Apps Script project should have the two functions mentioned above.

Next, please select the "sendTop10CrashToSlack" function from the dropdown above, and then click Debug or Run to execute the test once; since the first execution requires authentication, please run it at least once before proceeding to the next step.

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*Pt-falvO3uCtfSrJpNZeZQ.png)

**Once the test runs successfully, you can start setting up a schedule for automatic execution:**

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*-lI8vcewsS5ZRt5vR1iAkg.jpeg)

Select the clock icon on the left, then choose "+ Add Trigger" at the bottom right.

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*V20eoW30mHYnHkhUk5uKnw.png)

For the first option "Choose which function to run" (the function entry to be executed), please change it to `sendTop10CrashToSlack`, and set the time interval according to your preference.

> _⚠️⚠️⚠️_ **_Please pay special attention that each query will accumulate and incur charges, so do not set it randomly; otherwise, you might end up bankrupt due to scheduled automatic executions._**

### Completion

![Example Result Image](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*J4k9SMFX8hU7-M_zX3wDtw.jpeg)
