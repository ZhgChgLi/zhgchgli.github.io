First, here’s the result image. We query Crashlytics crash logs weekly; filter out the top 10 issues with the most crashes; and send the messages to the Slack Channel, making it easier for all iOS team members to quickly understand the current stability.

### Issues

For app developers, the Crash-Free Rate can be considered the most important metric; the data represents the proportion of app users who **did not encounter** a crash. I believe that regardless of the app, everyone should hope for a Crash-Free Rate of approximately 99.9%; however, in reality, this is impossible. As long as there is code, there can be bugs, and some crash issues are caused by underlying (Apple) or third-party SDKs. Additionally, the Daily Active Users (DAU) volume can also affect the Crash-Free Rate; the higher the DAU, the more likely it is to encounter various sporadic crash issues.

Since there is no app that is 100% crash-free, tracking and handling crashes becomes very important. Besides the most common [Google Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/products/crashlytics){:target="_blank"} (formerly Fabric), there are actually other options like [Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Bugfender](https://bugfender.com/){:target="_blank"}... I haven't compared these tools in practice, so interested friends can research them on their own; if you use other tools, you won't be able to utilize the content introduced in this article.

#### Crashlytics

**The benefits of choosing Crashlytics include:**
- Stability, backed by Google
- Free, easy and quick to install
- Besides crashes, it can also log error events (e.g., Decode Error)
- A complete Firebase suite: other services include Google Analytics, Realtime Database, Remote Config, Authentication, Cloud Messaging, Cloud Storage...

> _As a side note: I do not recommend building a formal service entirely on Firebase, as the costs can become very high once traffic increases... it's a classic bait-and-switch scenario._

**However, Crashlytics also has many drawbacks:**
- Crashlytics does not provide an API to query crash data
- Crashlytics only retains crash logs for the last 90 days
- Crashlytics's integration support and flexibility are very poor

The most painful aspect is the poor integration support and flexibility, combined with the lack of an API to write scripts for querying crash data; we can only rely on manually checking Crashlytics for crash logs from time to time to track crash issues.

#### **Integrations Supported by Crashlytics:**
1. \[Email Notification\] — Trending stability issues (crash issues encountered by more and more users)
2. \[Slack, Email Notification\] — New Fatal Issue (crash issue)
3. \[Slack, Email Notification\] — New Non-Fatal Issue (non-crash issue)
4. \[Slack, Email Notification\] — Velocity Alert (sudden increase in crash issues)
5. \[Slack, Email Notification\] — Regression Alert (issues that were solved but reappeared)
6. Crashlytics to Jira issue

The content and rules of the above integrations cannot be customized.

Initially, we directly used 2. New Fatal Issue to Slack or Email, and if sent to Email, we would trigger subsequent processing scripts via [Google Apps Script](../d414bdbdb8c9/); however, this notification would flood the notification channel, as it would notify for every crash, regardless of whether it was significant or just a minor issue caused by the user's device or iOS itself. As DAU grew, we were bombarded with these notifications daily, and only about 10% of them were truly valuable, related to errors in our code.

Thus, it did not solve the problem of Crashlytics being difficult to track automatically, and we still had to spend a lot of time reviewing whether the issues were important.

### Crashlytics \+ Big Query

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*ABFLOY1AEKkSJah6EVJEkg.png)

After searching around, I found this method, which is the only one provided by the official documentation; this is the trap under the free candy coating. I suspect that neither Crashlytics nor Analytics Events will ever plan to release an API for users to query data via API; the official recommendation is to import data into Big Query for use, and exceeding the free storage and query limits in Big Query incurs charges.

> _Storage: The first 10 GB per month is free._

> _Query: The first 1 TB per month is free. (The query limit refers to how much data is processed when executing a SELECT statement.)_

> _For more details, please refer to the Big Query pricing documentation._

The setup details for Crashlytics to Big Query can be found in the [**official documentation**](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/bigquery-export){:target="_blank"}, which requires enabling GCP services, binding a credit card, etc.

### Getting Started with Big Query to Query Crashlytics Logs

Once the import cycle for Crashlytics Logs to Big Query is set up and the first import has data, we can start querying the data.

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*dvjnubHWwYF7Bhz8SiuuLA.jpeg)

First, go to the Firebase project -> Crashlytics -> click on the "•••" in the upper right corner -> select "BigQuery dataset."

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*TEJY6kH9guplY1kZvOfxzw.jpeg)

After going to GCP -> Big Query, you can select "firebase_crashlytics" in the left "Explorer" -> choose your Table name -> "Detail" -> on the right, you can view Table information, including the latest modification time, used capacity, storage duration, etc.

> _Confirm that there is imported data available for querying._

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*4atxy5aRHkQrVvRE1GE2AQ.jpeg)

The upper tab can be switched to "SCHEMA" to view the column information of the Table or refer to the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/bigquery-export#without_stack_traces){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*K0got1UinY2y4cFxZ2HM3w.jpeg)

Clicking the "Query" button in the upper right corner opens an interface with an SQL Builder (recommended for those unfamiliar with SQL):

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*fxget7SOAb7hlnKDWhvmFQ.jpeg)

Or you can directly click "COMPOSE NEW QUERY" to open a blank Query Editor:

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*3T7vHuR4LoojnZ5xe6LWfg.png)

Regardless of the method, it’s the same text editor; after entering the SQL, you can pre-check the SQL syntax and the estimated query cost in the upper right corner (`This query will process XXX when run.`):

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*wGMkfqGPg277BzuUgOag1w.jpeg)

After confirming the query, click "RUN" in the upper left to execute the query, and the results will be displayed in the Query results section below.

> **_⚠️ After clicking "RUN" to execute the query, it will accumulate towards the query limit, which will incur charges; so please be careful not to run random queries._**

#### **If you are unfamiliar with SQL, you can first understand the basic usage and then refer to the Crashlytics [official examples to modify](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/bigquery-export){:target="_blank"}:**

**1. Count the number of crashes per day for the last 30 days:**
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT event_id) AS number_of_crashes,
  FORMAT_TIMESTAMP("%F", event_timestamp) AS date_of_crashes
FROM
 `yourProjectID.firebase_crashlytics.yourTableName`
GROUP BY
  date_of_crashes
ORDER BY
  date_of_crashes DESC
LIMIT 30;
```

**2. Query the top 10 most frequent crashes in the last 7 days:**
```sql
SELECT
  DISTINCT issue_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT event_id) AS number_of_crashes,
  COUNT(DISTINCT installation_uuid) AS number_of_impacted_user,
  blame_frame.file,
  blame_frame.line
FROM
  `yourProjectID.firebase_crashlytics.yourTableName`
WHERE
  event_timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(),INTERVAL 168 HOUR)
  AND event_timestamp < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
GROUP BY
  issue_id,
  blame_frame.file,
  blame_frame.line
ORDER BY
  number_of_crashes DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

> _However, the data retrieved using this method may not match the order seen in Crashlytics, likely due to grouping by blame_frame.file (nullable) and blame_frame.line (nullable)._

**3. Query the 10 devices with the most crashes in the last 7 days:**
```sql
SELECT
  device.model,
COUNT(DISTINCT event_id) AS number_of_crashes
FROM
  `yourProjectID.firebase_crashlytics.yourTableName`
WHERE
  event_timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 168 HOUR)
  AND event_timestamp < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
GROUP BY
  device.model
ORDER BY
  number_of_crashes DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

For more examples, please refer to the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/bigquery-export#example_4_filter_by_custom_key){:target="_blank"}.

> _If your SQL returns no data, please first ensure that the specified conditions' Crashlytics data has been imported into Big Query (for example, the default SQL example queries the crash records of the day, but the data may not have been synchronized yet); if you confirm there is data, then check if the filtering conditions are correct._

#### Top 10 Crashlytics Issue Big Query SQL

Here, we modify the official example from 2. We want the results to match the crash issues and sorting data we see on the first page of Crashlytics.

**Top 10 crash issues in the last 7 days:**
```sql
SELECT 
  DISTINCT issue_id, 
  issue_title, 
  issue_subtitle, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT event_id) AS number_of_crashes, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT installation_uuid) AS number_of_impacted_user 
FROM 
  `yourProjectID.firebase_crashlytics.yourTableName`
WHERE 
  is_fatal = true 
  AND event_timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), 
    INTERVAL 7 DAY
  ) 
GROUP BY 
  issue_id, 
  issue_title, 
  issue_subtitle 
ORDER BY 
  number_of_crashes DESC 
LIMIT 
  10;
```

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*YtbpV4tm0Z_iwrOA0AJ9Jg.jpeg)

Comparing the results of the Top 10 crash issues in Crashlytics, it matches ✅.

### Using Google Apps Script to Regularly Query & Forward to Slack

Go to the [Google Apps Script homepage](https://script.google.com/home){:target="_blank"} -> log in with the same account as Big Query -> click "New Project" in the upper left corner, and after opening the new project, you can rename it in the upper left corner.

#### First, let's complete the integration with Big Query to obtain query data:

Refer to the [official documentation](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/advanced/bigquery){:target="_blank"} example, and insert the above Query SQL.
```javascript
function queryiOSTop10Crashes() {
  var request = {
    query: 'SELECT DISTINCT issue_id, issue_title, issue_subtitle, COUNT(DISTINCT event_id) AS number_of_crashes, COUNT(DISTINCT installation_uuid) AS number_of_impacted_user FROM `firebase_crashlytics.yourTableName` WHERE is_fatal = true AND event_timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB( CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 7 DAY ) GROUP BY issue_id, issue_title, issue_subtitle ORDER BY number_of_crashes DESC LIMIT 10;',
    useLegacySql: false
  };
  var queryResults = BigQuery.Jobs.query(request, 'yourProjectID');
  var jobId = queryResults.jobReference.jobId;

  // Check on status of the Query Job.
  var sleepTimeMs = 500;
  while (!queryResults.jobComplete) {
    Utilities.sleep(sleepTimeMs);
    sleepTimeMs *= 2;
    queryResults = BigQuery.Jobs.getQueryResults(projectId, jobId);
  }

  // Get all the rows of results.
  var rows = queryResults.rows;
  while (queryResults.pageToken) {
    queryResults = BigQuery.Jobs.getQueryResults(projectId, jobId, {
      pageToken: queryResults.pageToken
    });
    Logger.log(queryResults.rows);
    rows = rows.concat(queryResults.rows);
  }

  var data = new Array(rows.length);
  for (var i = 0; i < rows.length; i++) {
    var cols = rows[i].f;
    data[i] = new Array(cols.length);
    for (var j = 0; j < cols.length; j++) {
      data[i][j] = cols[j].v;
    }
  }

  return data
}
```

**query:** The query can be replaced with any SQL you have written.

**The structure of the returned object is as follows:**
```json
[
  [
    "67583e77da3b9b9d3bd8feffeb13c8d0",
    "<compiler-generated> line 2147483647",

    "Pinkoi",
    "specialized JSONDecoder.decode<A>(_:from:)",
    "47",
    "38"
  ]
]
```

You can see it is a two-dimensional array.

#### Adding the Function to Forward to Slack:

Continue to add a new function below the above code.
```javascript
function sendTop10CrashToSlack() {

  var iOSTop10Crashes = queryiOSTop10Crashes();
  var top10Tasks = new Array();
  
  for (var i = 0; i < iOSTop10Crashes.length ; i++) {
    var issue_id = iOSTop10Crashes[i][0];
    var issue_title = iOSTop10Crashes[i][1];
    var issue_subtitle = iOSTop10Crashes[i][2];
    var number_of_crashes = iOSTop10Crashes[i][3];
    var number_of_impacted_user = iOSTop10Crashes[i][4];

    var strip_title = issue_title.replace(/[\<|\>]/g, '');
    var strip_subtitle = issue_subtitle.replace(/[\<|\>]/g, '');
    
    top10Tasks.push("<https://console.firebase.google.com/u/1/project/yourProjectID/crashlytics/app/yourProjectID/issues/"+issue_id+"|"+(i+1)+". Crash: "+number_of_crashes+" times ("+number_of_impacted_user+" users) - "+strip_title+" "+strip_subtitle+">");
  }
```

```javascript
var messages = top10Tasks.join("\n");
var payload = {
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "header",
      "text": {
        "type": "plain_text",

          "emoji": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
};

var slackWebHookURL = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXX"; // Replace with your incoming webhook URL
UrlFetchApp.fetch(slackWebHookURL,{
  method             : 'post',
  contentType        : 'application/json',
  payload            : JSON.stringify(payload)
})
}
```

#### Testing & Scheduling

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*epwnVrltY7ei8_osPnbaww.jpeg)

At this point, your Google Apps Script project should have the two functions mentioned above.

Next, please select the "sendTop10CrashToSlack" function from the dropdown above, and then click Debug or Run to execute the test once; since the first execution requires authentication, please run it at least once before proceeding to the next step.

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*Pt-falvO3uCtfSrJpNZeZQ.png)

**Once the test runs successfully, you can start setting up a schedule for automatic execution:**

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*-lI8vcewsS5ZRt5vR1iAkg.jpeg)

On the left, select the clock icon, then choose the "+ Add Trigger" option in the bottom right.

![](/assets/e77b80cc6f89/1*V20eoW30mHYnHkhUk5uKnw.png)

For the first option "Choose which function to run" (the function entry to be executed), change it to `sendTop10CrashToSlack`, and set the time interval according to your preference.

> _⚠️⚠️⚠️_ **_Please be especially careful as each query will accumulate and incur charges, so do not set it randomly; otherwise, you might end up bankrupt due to scheduled automatic executions._**

### Completion
