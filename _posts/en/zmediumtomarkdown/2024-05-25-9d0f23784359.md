### Plane.so: A Free and Open Source Project Management Tool Similar to Asana/Jira with Self-Hosting Support

Introduction to the Plane.so project management tool and its use with the Scrum process



![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*BQgytUYomqHcD33LWA-ZaQ.png)

### Background
#### Asana

I first experienced the power of the Asana project management tool at my previous company, Pinkoi. Whether for internal project management or cross-team collaboration, Asana plays a crucial role in decoupling dependencies between people and tasks, enhancing collaboration efficiency.

At my previous company, all teams, from the product team to the operations and business teams (such as HRBP, Finance, Marketing, BD, etc.), had a publicly accessible Project as a single collaboration entry point for cross-team interactions. When other teams needed assistance, they could directly create a Task (or use a Template Task) in that Project (which usually had a "Need Help!" section), and the internal team would take over and arrange the Task.

For cross-team collaboration with the operations team, such as procurement and recruitment processes, Tasks could be created directly and tracked for progress; collaboration with the business team included planning marketing activities and tasks requiring engineering assistance for modifications, among others.

**Without Asana or similar project management tools:**
- We would need to communicate directly with the other team for everything. Direct communication for P0 matters is the most effective, but in daily operations, about 90% of tasks are not P0 matters. Communicating directly for every small and large issue is inefficient and can [interrupt the workflow](../11f6c8568154/) of others.
- Task execution lacks transparency; only the parties involved know the status and progress. For multi-party tasks, progress can only be confirmed through repeated communication. Additionally, supervisors find it difficult to grasp everyone's tasks for reasonable arrangements.
- Task arrangement: We often receive many Tasks with varying priorities and directions. Having a tool allows us to collect and categorize similar issues, making it easier to identify important tasks for future resolution.
- Task handover: A tool records task details and execution status, allowing for quick handover of tasks when assistance from others is needed.

Returning to project management, Asana provides a flexible, multi-dimensional, and automated project management tool that can be customized according to needs.


> There are many ways to use Asana; the following are just a few use cases. It is recommended to clarify your needs before looking for relevant Asana examples to apply.

> The Asana agent in Taiwan also offers comprehensive training. If interested, you can contact them.

**Example 1**


![Team Project](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*BH_lsGILJFpyUHDgGam3cw.png)

Team Project
- To Do: Tasks to start this week or next week
- In Progress: Ongoing tasks
- Review: Completed, waiting for Sprint Review
- Backlog: Task pool, from which Tasks are selected for execution each week



![Team Scrum Project](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*ETtOn0T-dLraFbI5nP6uZA.png)

Team Scrum Project

In addition to the main Team Project, a Scrum Project is created to arrange tasks (Asana Tasks can belong to multiple Projects) and review the execution of each Sprint's tasks.

**Example 2**


![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*xgmWK9YuWkAH9NxQoZle4Q.png)


Example two uses Sections to differentiate Sprints, creating a new Section each week to drag tasks into, and additionally marking other statuses with Labels.
#### Back to Reality

As mentioned earlier, the above scenarios are from my previous company, Pinkoi, where we had the Asana project management tool. In the past few months, returning to an environment without project management tools has made me acutely aware of the importance of such tools for work efficiency.


Currently, the environment lacks more modern project management tools. Due to procurement (which requires expenditure control), internal control issues (purely intranet), and personal data audit restrictions (must be on-premises), it is not possible to directly implement Asana.

Given these environmental constraints, we can only start with open-source project management tools that support self-hosting. The solutions found include: Redmine, OpenProject, Taiga… After trying several, the results were disappointing, with missing features and unfriendly UI/UX; until I accidentally discovered a project management tool called Plane.so, which was newly launched in January 2023.

**By the way, I recommend this website, which includes many services that support self-hosting:**

[**awesome-selfhosted**](https://awesome-selfhosted.net/){:target="_blank"}  
[_A list of Free Software network services and web applications which can be hosted on your own servers_ awesome-selfhosted.net](https://awesome-selfhosted.net/){:target="_blank"}

> After all that, let's begin the main content. 

#### Table of Contents

This article is divided into:
- Introduction to Plane.so
- Plane.so Operation Tutorial
- Plane.so x Scrum Workflow Example
- Appendix

You can refer to your needs; for Docker self-hosted setup instructions, please refer to the next article “[**Plane.so Docker Self-Hosted Setup Record**](../9903c9783a97/)”.

### Introduction to Plane.so
#### Overview

[![](https://plane.so/og-image.png)](https://plane.so/){:target="_blank"}

Plane was established in 2022 and is a startup from Delaware, USA, and India. Currently, observing [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/planepowers/){:target="_blank"} and [Github](https://github.com/makeplane/plane){:target="_blank"}, most of the developers are based in India; the company has raised $4 million in seed funding (invested by OSS Capital).

[![](https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/star-growth-plane.webp)](https://plane.so/blog/how-we-got-to-20k-github-stars){:target="_blank"}

Currently, Plane ranks first in the GitHub [project management category](https://github.com/topics/project-management){:target="_blank"}, is open-sourced under the [AGPL-3.0 license](https://github.com/makeplane/plane#AGPL-3.0-1-ov-file){:target="_blank"}, and the first version was released in January 2023. It is still in the development stage and has not yet provided a formal release version.

> **Please note:** ⚠️ **Open source does not equal free** ⚠️. Just like GitHub and GitLab, there are many project management tools similar to GitHub, such as Asana, Jira, Clickup, but there is not yet a sufficiently good open-source product that can compete with GitLab, and Plane's goal is to become the GitLab of project management tools.

- Updates to the development version are approximately every two to three weeks, with some adjustments potentially being significant or still having security issues.
- Currently does not support multiple languages (Chinese).
- Supports [Self-Hosted](../9903c9783a97/).
- **Currently, the official version does not provide export from Cloud to import into Self-Hosted; it can only be achieved through API integration. Therefore, if considering on-premises self-hosted use, it is recommended to treat the Cloud as a trial version.**
- macOS App, iOS App, and Android App are also actively under development.

**For the Plane Product Roadmap, please refer to [official information](https://sites.plane.so/plane/459cfcdf-dc9c-49a6-9d4b-a89f91440189/?board=kanban){:target="_blank"}:**

#### Solutions

Plane offers a cloud version service starting at $0, with Pro providing more frameworks, integrations, and automation features.

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*sjk-v_qOAWFppWG1zcFpOQ.png)

[Additionally, the official team is promoting a $799 early lifetime plan. Teams interested in supporting this can refer to this plan directly.](https://plane.so/one){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*AzRTMK-xbYx1SuSjXzI2fw.png)

The Community Edition (officially referred to as CE), Self-Hosted version, also starts at $0. **If you want to use advanced features, you still need to purchase Pro, but it can support Self-Hosted.**

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*qJF4m66lrL74zZVjn5fzNQ.png)

#### Framework

Plane.so differs from Asana in its multi-dimensional flexibility, but Plane is composed of the following frameworks for project management:
- Issues: Similar to Asana Tasks, any work is created as an Issue, which can then be scheduled for processing or kept as a record.

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*pIAY63Q2gldFKfGJSce2qQ.png)

- Cycles: Similar to Sprints, a time period or version for an iteration, where each Issue can only exist in one Cycle.

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*FWPbQUefbahYxaTiIlpawA.png)

- Modules: Project, module, and categorization features, where each Issue can be associated with multiple Modules.

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*R5tZxXT5Tu0WgMfy-xcxnQ.png)

- Layouts & Views: You can view Issues using Gantt charts, calendars, Kanban boards, lists, and Sheet modes, and you can save filter conditions and display methods as Views for quick access.

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*R5tZxXT5Tu0WgMfy-xcxnQ.png)

- Inbox: Issue Proposed process, allowing the creation of proposal Issues, which must be approved before they are actually created in the project for execution; if not approved, they are discarded.

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*pYH9rsIMI34wBIBv0hxfXg.png)

- Pages: A simple documentation feature for recording work and product matters.

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*_8OiZDYMGTYrEfj_eRypfw.png)

- Drive: Similar to Google Drive for team file management.

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*uEMf9QnbPmbVJ5fuq-NFmw.png)

Currently, the free version and CE (Self-Hosted) version do not have this feature.
### Plane.so Operation Tutorial

We can quickly and freely start using the Plane Cloud version:

[**Plane | Simple, extensible, open-source project management tool.**](https://app.plane.so/){:target="_blank"} 
[_Open-source project management tool to manage issues, sprints, and product roadmaps with peace of mind._ app\.plane\.so](https://app.plane.so/){:target="_blank"}
#### Workspace
```

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*yxtGND6xaZk8ey3vuvqMiw.png)

- The first time you enter Plane.so, you will need to create your first Workspace.
- A Workspace is similar to an Asana workspace; one account can join multiple Workspaces.
- For small companies, cross-team collaboration can occur within the same Workspace.
- For large companies, since Plane does not have features like Asana's Team functionality or Project grouping, using the same Workspace may lead to project confusion. It is recommended to use separate Workspaces to distinguish teams.

**Once created, you can switch between different Workspaces from the Workspace dropdown menu, and you can also access Workspace Settings from here:**

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*uKD3DSeeZdEzS3meTqGhiw.png)

**Settings include:**
- General Workspace profile picture, name, URL
- Billing and plans payment information, upgrade options
- Integrations third-party integrations; the free version currently only offers GitHub and Slack integrations
- Imports import functionality; currently only supports Jira and GitHub Project imports
- Exports export functionality; currently only supports exporting in csv, excel, json formats
- Webhooks API tokens for custom API integration

**A particularly important setting is Members, where we need to invite team members to join the Workspace:**

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*as1_IkYpiBHu7uB6ftuZIw.png)

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*xPF2Bdp8KywAOR4AoyXWbA.png)

Roles:
- Guest/Viewer Currently, there is no significant difference in functionality; they can only view Issues, Comments, and Emojis. External users with email addresses from different organizations are considered Guests, while those from the same organization are considered Viewers.
- Member can access all functionalities
- Admin can access Settings

#### Home

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*dy4oF2haCVir8iU5OYGq3A.png)

- Home displays all Projects and member statuses within the Workspace.
- Analytics provides analysis of all members and Issues.
- Projects lists all Projects.
- All Issues shows Issues from all Projects.
- Active Cycles displays the current Cycle status of all Projects.
- Notifications provide updates on Issues.

#### Projects

Enter Projects to view all public and joined Projects:

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*F3721uSBCQZYQjUAPNELJw.png)

- Project name, description, cover image, prefix (Issue Alias e.g. `APP-1`)
- Project permissions: Public allows all members in the Workspace to view and join; Private only allows invited members to join.
- Lead: the primary person responsible for the Project.

**In the upper right corner of the Project, the "…" allows you to:**

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*KSNKPmXhVBE4odSI9gvzwg.png)

- Add to favorites, Pin to My Favorites (above Your Projects)
- Publish to generate a public external link, similar to the official [Roadmap Project](https://sites.plane.so/plane/459cfcdf-dc9c-49a6-9d4b-a89f91440189/?board=kanban){:target="_blank"}
- Draft Issues to view saved draft Issues
- Archives to view archived Issues

**Other settings:**

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*vlv6RvQu1LBTaHSWarnecg.png)

- General: general project settings
- Members: project members and permissions
- States: project Issue statuses (to be introduced later)
- Labels: management of project Labels
- Features: control which features to enable (Inbox feature is not enabled by default)
- Estimates: project estimation field settings (to be introduced later)
- Integrations: third-party integrations (Workspace must be enabled first)
- Automations: the free version currently only supports automatically archiving Closed Issues after X time and automatically closing incomplete Issues after X time.

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*PiAMYBfu86syI2rLq7I-Cg.png)

- The homepage displays the current Cycle along with its execution status and burn-down chart.
- It also shows upcoming Cycles and completed Cycles.
- Currently, Cycles need to be created manually.
- For example, if there is a Sprint every two weeks, SXX needs to be created and the time period specified.
- Cycle time periods cannot overlap.
- Cycle time periods cannot be set to past times.
- An Issue can only be added to one Cycle.

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*S13TeKyy-t4Oiz4c2p8J-w.png)

### ⚠️⚠️Disclaimer⚠️⚠️


> The above is an introduction to the usage of version 0.20-Dev as of 2024–05–25. The official team is actively developing new features and optimizing user experience. The mentioned limitations may be improved in the future, so please refer to the latest version for the best experience.

### Plane.so x Scrum Workflow Example
#### Structure


![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*Id2hjfltcwswSpYzG12Diw.png)

- Each team has its own Workspace
- Each team will have a main product Project
- Projects: Other projects can be created, such as marketing campaigns, customer support, or external collaboration projects, separate from the main product development Project
- Modules: Create Function Modules (design, frontend, backend, app) to facilitate Team Lead tracking, and establish Modules for OKRs or project goals (e.g., increase conversion rates, OKR-1 increase GMV…)
- Cycle: Establish Cycles based on Sprint cycles; if there is one Sprint per week, you can create `W12` or use the Monday date to create `2024–05–27`
- Currently, Cycles cannot be created automatically, so future Cycles need to be established monthly or weekly in advance
- Any work must open an Issue
- If possible, add Start Date & Due Date, Modules, and Priority to the Issue
- **If an Issue keeps switching between In-Progress & Cycle (not completing within one Cycle), consider breaking down the Issue for easier project management**

#### Process
- **Sprint Cycle: One week**
- Backlog: Open Issues for any work or ideas, State = Backlog, **fill in Estimate, Priority**
- **Weekly Sprint Planning Meeting on Monday: Select Issues from Backlog and ongoing Issues (To Do or In Progress), set Priority/Estimate, arrange execution for this Sprint, and add to Cycle**
- If there are Issues executed out of order during the Sprint, they also need to be opened directly in this week's Cycle
- Daily Stand-up: Spend 15 minutes each morning quickly sharing the status of Issue execution
- Change the status of Issues ready for execution to ToDo/In Progress
- Change the status of completed Issues to Done, or create an additional Review State
- **Weekly Sprint Review Meeting on Friday: Simply review the Issues from this week (not planning for next week), quickly recap completed Issues, and ensure that Estimates are filled in for future statistics.**
- Every Friday, try to ensure that all Issues within the Cycle are completed; **uncompleted Issues can be chosen to be added to the next week's Cycle or marked as Pending/Cancel**.
- Continuously iterate the above process to manage all Issues and Projects

### ⚠️⚠️Disclaimer⚠️⚠️


> The above is just a workflow example; please note that there is no perfect process, only a process that suits your team; refer to the structure provided by Plane.so to unleash creativity and find the best project management method. 



### Appendix
#### API

Plane.so has a clean front-end and back-end separation architecture, so there is a complete API available for use. After creating API Tokens from Workspace Settings, you can use the API Request Header `X-API-Key` to make requests. For API Endpoint request methods, please refer to the official [API documentation](https://docs.plane.so/api-reference/introduction){:target="_blank"}.


> However, since the official documentation is not yet complete, many request methods are not listed in the documentation. The fastest way is to open the browser tools to view Network requests and see how the official requests the API, then apply your own Key to use it.

#### Issue Comment: Submitting Issues Directly After Selecting Characters in Chinese

I opened an issue for the official team and checked the source code. It seems that the chances of a fix are quite low because the initial design did not consider the need to select a language, thus directly binding the Enter key event to submit comments.

**Browser Extension Workaround:**

Here is a workaround JavaScript script that I wrote to hook the Enter event.

1. First, install a JavaScript browser injection extension:

This is a shared extension for Chromium; other browsers can also search for similar JavaScript injection tools.

2. Go back to Plane.so, click on the extension -> click the “+” button.

3. Inject the following JavaScript into Plane.so:
```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
 if (event.key === 'Enter' || event.keyCode === 13) { // event.keyCode is for older browsers
  const focusedElement = document.activeElement;
  const targetButtons = focusedElement.parentElement.parentElement.parentElement.parentElement.parentElement.querySelectorAll('button[type="submit"]');
   if (targetButtons.length > 0 && targetButtons[0].textContent.trim().toLowerCase() === "comment") {
    console.log("HIT");
    // Focus the active element and place the cursor at the end
    focusedElement.focus();
    if (window.getSelection) {
     var range = document.createRange();
     var selection = window.getSelection();
     range.selectNodeContents(focusedElement);
     range.collapse(false);
     selection.removeAllRanges();
     selection.addRange(range);
    }
    event.stopImmediatePropagation();
   }
 }
},true);
```

- After pasting the code, click “Save” to store it.

Return to Plane.so (refresh) and open an issue to test the comment functionality.

- Pressing Enter to select characters will no longer automatically submit. Press Space + Shift Enter to create a new line, and manually click Comment to submit your comment.

### ⚠️⚠️⚠️Security Issues⚠️⚠️⚠️

> Since Plane.so is still in the development stage and the product is new, it is uncertain whether there are any security issues. It is recommended not to upload any sensitive data to avoid data leakage in case of significant service issues, or use [Self-Hosted](../9903c9783a97/) for local intranet use only.
