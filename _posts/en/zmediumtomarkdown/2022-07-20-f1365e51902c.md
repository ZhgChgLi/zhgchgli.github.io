### App Store Connect API Now Supports Reading and Managing Customer Reviews

App Store Connect API 2\.0\+ has been fully updated to support management of In\-app purchases, Subscriptions, and Customer Reviews.

### 2022/07/19 News


![[Upcoming transition from the XML feed to the App Store Connect API](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=yqf4kgwb){:target="_blank"}](/assets/f1365e51902c/1*hHJ66r9BgJQsGnRYqbB_8g.png)

[Upcoming transition from the XML feed to the App Store Connect API](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=yqf4kgwb){:target="_blank"}

This morning, I received the latest news from [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/news/rss/news.rss){:target="_blank"}, announcing that the App Store Connect API has added support for three new features: In\-app purchases, Subscriptions, and Customer Reviews management. This allows developers to integrate Apple's development process more flexibly with CI/CD or business backends for closer and more efficient collaboration!

I haven't dealt with In\-app purchases or Subscriptions, but I am very excited about Customer Reviews. I previously published an article titled "[**AppStore APP‚Äôs Reviews Slack Bot Insights**](../cb0c68c33994/)" discussing ways to integrate app reviews into workflows.


![Slack Review Bot ‚Äî [ZReviewsBot](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewsBot){:target="_blank"}](/assets/f1365e51902c/1*igukM7FTLxaX2hpVtFPMjQ.png)

Slack Review Bot ‚Äî [ZReviewsBot](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewsBot){:target="_blank"}

Before the App Store Connect API supported this, there were only two ways to obtain iOS app reviews:

**One** was to subscribe to the [Public RSS](https://rss.itunes.apple.com/zh-tw){:target="_blank"} feed, but this RSS feed does not allow for flexible filtering, provides limited information, has a quantity limit, and we occasionally encounter data inconsistency issues, making it quite unstable.

**Two** was to use [**Fastlane**](https://fastlane.tools/){:target="_blank"} **‚Äî [SpaceShip](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/spaceship){:target="_blank"}** to encapsulate complex web operations and session management, fetching review data from the App Store Connect backend (essentially simulating a web scraper to crawl the backend for data).
- The advantage is that the data is comprehensive and stable; we have been integrated for a year without encountering any data issues.
- The downside is that the session expires every month, requiring manual re-login, and Apple ID now requires 2FA verification, so this step also needs to be completed manually to produce a valid session. Additionally, if the session is generated from a different IP than the one used, it will expire immediately (making it very difficult to deploy the bot on a network service with a dynamic IP).

[important-note-about-session-duration](https://docs.fastlane.tools/best-practices/continuous-integration/#important-note-about-session-duration){:target="_blank"} by Fastlane
- The expiration is irregular every month, so it needs to be updated periodically, which can be quite annoying over time; moreover, this " **Know How** " is actually difficult to hand over to other colleagues.

> However, since there is no other way, we can only do this until I received the news this morning...

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The official plan is to discontinue the original XML (RSS) access method in November 2022.**

### 2022/08/10 Update

I have developed a new "[ZReviewTender ‚Äî Free and Open Source App Reviews Monitoring Bot](../e36e48bb9265/)" based on the new App Store Connect API.
### App Store Connect API 2.0+ Customer Reviews Trial
#### Create App Store Connect API Key

First, we need to log in to the App Store Connect backend, go to "Users and Access" -> "Keys" -> "[**App Store Connect API**](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/api){:target="_blank"}":

![](/assets/f1365e51902c/1*0NimMOcIqQ95nzjBBKYe8A.png)

Click the "+" button, enter a name and permissions; for detailed permission rules, please refer to the official website. To reduce testing issues, select "App Manager" and set the permissions to the maximum.

![](/assets/f1365e51902c/1*Bt8ddt7GrZs1ERaFamftVw.png)

Click the "Download API Key" on the right to download and save your "AuthKey_XXX.p8" Key.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This Key can only be downloaded once, please **keep it safe**. If lost, you can only revoke the existing one and create a new one. ‚ö†Ô∏è 

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Do not leak the .p8 Key File ‚ö†Ô∏è** 

#### App Store Connect API Access Method
```bash
curl -v -H 'Authorization: Bearer [signed token]' "https://api.appstoreconnect.apple.com/v1/apps"
```
#### Signed Token (JWT, JSON Web Token) Generation Method

Refer to the [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/generating_tokens_for_api_requests){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/f1365e51902c/1*KDv2ra17oSp5UXKy-VZA1g.png)

- JWT HeaderÔºö

```json
{kid:"YOUR_KEY_ID", typ:"JWT", alg:"ES256"}
```

`YOUR_KEY_ID`: Refer to the image above.
- JWT PayloadÔºö

```json
{
  iss: 'YOUR_ISSUE_ID',
  iat: TOKEN creation time (UNIX TIMESTAMP e.g 1658326020),
  exp: TOKEN expiration time (UNIX TIMESTAMP e.g 1658327220),
  aud: 'appstoreconnect-v1'
}
```

`YOUR_ISSUE_ID`: Refer to the image above.

`exp TOKEN expiration time`: This will vary depending on different access functions or settings, some can be permanent, while others expire after 20 minutes and need to be regenerated. For details, please refer to the [official explanation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/generating_tokens_for_api_requests#3878467){:target="_blank"}.
#### Use [JWT.IO](https://jwt.io/){:target="_blank"} or the following Ruby example to generate JWT.
```

jwt\.rb:
```ruby
require 'jwt'
require 'time'

keyFile = File.read('./AuthKey_XXXX.p8') # YOUR .p8 private key file path
privateKey = OpenSSL::PKey::EC.new(keyFile)

payload = {
            iss: 'YOUR_ISSUE_ID',
            iat: Time.now.to_i,
            exp: Time.now.to_i + 60*20,
            aud: 'appstoreconnect-v1'
          }

token = JWT.encode payload, privateKey, 'ES256', header_fields={kid:"YOUR_KEY_ID", typ:"JWT"}
puts token


decoded_token = JWT.decode token, privateKey, true, { algorithm: 'ES256' }
puts decoded_token
```
- Ruby JWT tool is here: [https://github\.com/jwt/ruby\-jwt](https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwt){:target="_blank"}


**You will ultimately get a JWT result similar to the following:**
```
4oxjoi8j69rHQ58KqPtrFABBWHX2QH7iGFyjkc5q6AJZrKA3AcZcCFoFMTMHpM.pojTEWQufMTvfZUW1nKz66p3emsy2v5QseJX5UJmfRjpxfjgELUGJraEVtX7tVg6aicmJT96q0snP034MhfgoZAB46MGdtC6kv2Vj6VeL2geuXG87Ys6ADijhT7mfHUcbmLPJPNZNuMttcc.fuFAJZNijRHnCA2BRqq7RZEJBB7TLsm1n4WM1cW0yo67KZp-Bnwx9y45cmH82QPAgKcG-y1UhRUrxybi5b9iNN
```
#### Let's give it a try?

With the Token, we can now test the App Store Connect API!
```bash
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer JWT' "https://api.appstoreconnect.apple.com/v1/apps/APPID/customerReviews"
```
- `APPID` can be obtained from the App Store Connect backend:



![](/assets/f1365e51902c/1*yU4J85S6Q_e8c9NPYE8bNw.png)


Or from the App Store page:
- [https://apps\.apple\.com/tw/app/pinkoi/id557252416](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/pinkoi/id557252416){:target="_blank"}
- APPID = `557252416`



![](/assets/f1365e51902c/1*wWIpy8Y5G2F0A2FvQzp0hQ.png)

- Success! üöÄ We can now use this method to fetch App reviews, with complete data that can be fully automated without manual routine maintenance (JWT may expire, but the Private Key does not; we can generate JWT using the Private Key for each request).
- For other filtering parameters and operations, please refer to the [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/list_all_customer_reviews_for_an_app){:target="_blank"}.



> **‚ö†Ô∏è You can only access App review data for which you have permission ‚ö†Ô∏è** 




#### Complete Ruby Test Project

A Ruby file has been created to perform the above process, which you can clone and fill in the data to test.
