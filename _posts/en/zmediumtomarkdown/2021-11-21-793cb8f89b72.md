### Crashlytics \+ Google Analytics Automatic Query for App Crash\-Free Users Rate

Use Google Apps Script to query Crashlytics through Google Analytics and automatically fill it into Google Sheets



![](/assets/793cb8f89b72/1*yPSS8J7o-jowQ6NRYArzjQ.png)



> _In the previous article, "[Crashlytics \+ Big Query Creating a More Immediate and Convenient Crash Tracking Tool](../e77b80cc6f89/)," we exported Crashlytics crash records as Raw Data to Big Query and used Google Apps Script to automatically schedule queries for the Top 10 Crashes and publish messages to the Slack Channel._ 





This article continues to automate an important metric related to app crashes — **Crash-Free Users Rate, the percentage of users unaffected by crashes**. Many app teams likely continue to track and record this metric, which has traditionally been queried manually. The goal of this article is to automate this repetitive task and avoid the potential errors of manually copying data. As mentioned before, Firebase Crashlytics does not provide any API for users to query, so we will similarly need to connect Firebase data to other Google services and then query the relevant data through that service's API.

At first, I thought this data could also be queried from Big Query; however, this direction was completely wrong because Big Query contains the Raw Data of crashes and does not have data on users who did not crash, thus making it impossible to calculate the Crash-Free Users Rate. There is not much information available online regarding this requirement, and after searching for a while, I found someone mentioning the keyword Google Analytics; I knew that Firebase's Analytics and Events could be connected to GA for queries, but I did not expect that the Crash-Free Users Rate would also be included. After reviewing the GA API, Bingo!


![[API Dimensions & Metrics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/api-schema?hl=en){:target="_blank"}](/assets/793cb8f89b72/1*4BVf-FMVcY1UbVuLwfKOQg.png)

[API Dimensions & Metrics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/api-schema?hl=en){:target="_blank"}

[Google Analytics Data API \(GA4\)](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/api-schema#metrics){:target="_blank"} provides two metrics:
- **crashAffectedUsers**: the number of users affected by crashes
- **crashFreeUsersRate**: the percentage of users not affected by crashes (expressed as a decimal)


Now that the path is clear, we can start implementing it!
#### Connecting Firebase \-&gt; Google Analytics


You can refer to the [official documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9289234?hl=zh-Hant){:target="_blank"} for the setup steps, which are omitted in this article.
#### GA4 Query Explorer Tool

Before we start writing code, we can quickly build query conditions and obtain query results using the official Web GUI Tool. Once we confirm that the experimental results are what we want, we can begin writing code.

[Go to >>> GA4 Query Explorer](https://ga-dev-tools.web.app/ga4/query-explorer/){:target="_blank"}


![](/assets/793cb8f89b72/1*qsCMVfWIAzWdZ78LBj8n2A.jpeg)

- Remember to select GA4 in the upper left corner.
- After logging in on the right, choose the corresponding GA Account & Property.



![](/assets/793cb8f89b72/1*hFJ9KYfecVNmdi4VfDAyIw.png)

- Start Date, End Date: You can directly enter dates or use special variables to represent dates ( `yesterday`, `today`, `30daysAgo`, `7daysAgo` )



![](/assets/793cb8f89b72/1*GEa3BNpUAqoPD07gE-N21A.png)

- metrics: Add `crashFreeUsersRate`



![](/assets/793cb8f89b72/1*WygzFvmOLp2kUQC3H_lh2g.png)

- dimensions: Add `platform` (device types iOS/Android/Desktop...)



![](/assets/793cb8f89b72/1*RE8SIIVx4PUkqnHQVsJcTg.png)

- dimension filter: Add `platform`, `string`, `exact`, `iOS` or `Android`


Query the Crash Free Users Rate for both platforms separately.


![](/assets/793cb8f89b72/1*1NJNUZscuU2XIicgRPGFYg.png)


Scroll down and click "Make Request" to view the results, and we will obtain the Crash-Free Users Rate for the specified date range.


> _You can go back and open Firebase Crashlytics to compare whether the data under the same conditions is the same._ 
 

> _Here, we found that the numbers on both sides may have slight discrepancies (one of our numbers differed by 0.0002), the reason is unclear, but it is within an acceptable margin of error; if we uniformly use GA Crash-Free Users Rate, it cannot be considered an error._ 




#### Using Google Apps Script to Automatically Fill Data into Google Sheets

Next is the automation part. We will use Google Apps Script to query the GA Crash-Free Users Rate data and automatically fill it into our Google Sheets form, achieving the goal of automatic filling and tracking.


![](/assets/793cb8f89b72/1*kMByIU9_6mxg8-F4BbwLuw.png)


Assuming our Google Sheet looks like the image above.


![](/assets/793cb8f89b72/1*pnJ7gmjDefB9OLl0NgceLA.png)


You can click on Extensions -> Apps Script in Google Sheets to create a Google Apps Script or [click here for Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/home/start){:target="_blank"} -> Click "New Project" in the upper left corner.


![](/assets/793cb8f89b72/1*81_RPPZgBDvW4XplOHGmVg.png)


Once inside, you can click on the unnamed project name at the top to give it a project name.


![](/assets/793cb8f89b72/1*C4qUfJr2UHAzbcksP2zYWA.jpeg)


In the left "Services" section, click the "+" to add the "Google Analytics Data API".


![](/assets/793cb8f89b72/1*FfWGQiV2IpOAsQB6TN887g.png)


Return to the [GA4 Query Explorer](https://ga-dev-tools.web.app/ga4/query-explorer/){:target="_blank"} tool, and next to the Make Request button, you can check "Show Request JSON" to obtain the Request JSON for this condition.

Here is the translated text while preserving the original Markdown format:

```javascript
// Remember to add Google Analytics Data API to Services, or you'll see this error: ReferenceError: AnalyticsData is not defined
// https://ga-dev-tools.web.app/ga4/query-explorer/ -> property id
const propertyId = "";
// https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/googleSheetID/
const googleSheetID = "";
// Google Sheet name
const googleSheetName = "App Crash-Free Users Rate";

function execute() {
  Logger.log(fetchCrashFreeUsersRate())
}

function fetchCrashFreeUsersRate(platform = "iOS", startDate = "30daysAgo", endDate = "today") {
  const dimensionPlatform = AnalyticsData.newDimension();
  dimensionPlatform.name = "platform";

  const metric = AnalyticsData.newMetric();
  metric.name = "crashFreeUsersRate";

  const dateRange = AnalyticsData.newDateRange();
  dateRange.startDate = startDate;
  dateRange.endDate = endDate;

  const filterExpression = AnalyticsData.newFilterExpression();
  const filter = AnalyticsData.newFilter();
  filter.fieldName = "platform";
  const stringFilter = AnalyticsData.newStringFilter()
  stringFilter.value = platform;
  stringFilter.matchType = "EXACT";
  filter.stringFilter = stringFilter;
  filterExpression.filter = filter;

  const request = AnalyticsData.newRunReportRequest();
  request.dimensions = [dimensionPlatform];
  request.metrics = [metric];
  request.dateRanges = dateRange;
  request.dimensionFilter = filterExpression;

  const report = AnalyticsData.Properties.runReport(request, "properties/" + propertyId);

  return parseFloat(report.rows[0].metricValues[0].value) * 100;
}
```
- GA Property ID: You can also obtain it from the [GA4 Query Explorer](https://ga-dev-tools.web.app/ga4/query-explorer/){:target="_blank"} tool:

![](/assets/793cb8f89b72/1*_ypOYamULlL_dcDsph4KiQ.jpeg)

In the initial selection Property dropdown, the number below the selected Property is the `propertyId`.
- googleSheetID: You can obtain it from the Google Sheet URL [https://docs\.google\.com/spreadsheets/d/ `googleSheetID` /edit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/googleSheetID/edit){:target="_blank"}
- googleSheetName: The name of the Sheet in Google Sheet where crash records are stored.

```markdown
![](/assets/793cb8f89b72/1*5lCtwwr3kZlBEEoW_D33gw.jpeg)

Paste the above code into the code block on the right side of Google Apps Script and select the "execute" function from the method dropdown above, then you can click Debug to test if it can retrieve data correctly:

![](/assets/793cb8f89b72/1*patatPx4XveqzXfkmetZyA.jpeg)

The first execution will prompt an authorization window:

![](/assets/793cb8f89b72/1*6997jA1kINxLfhcxx2NcDQ.png)

Complete the account authorization following the steps.

![](/assets/793cb8f89b72/1*_UjZ9Gx3TEvuxZd4ypaYsw.png)

If the execution is successful, it will print the Crash-Free Users Rate in the Log below, indicating that the query was successful.

Next, we just need to add automatic input into Google Sheets, and we will be all set!

**Complete Code:**
```javascript
// Remeber add Google Analytics Data API to Services, or you'll see this error: ReferenceError: AnalyticsData is not defined

// https://ga-dev-tools.web.app/ga4/query-explorer/ -> property id
const propertyId = "";
// https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/googleSheetID/
const googleSheetID = "";
// Google Sheet 名稱
const googleSheetName = "";

function execute() {
  const today = new Date();
  const daysAgo7 = new Date(new Date().setDate(today.getDate() - 6)); // 今天不算，所以是 -6

  const spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById(googleSheetID);
  const sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName(googleSheetName);
  
  var rows = [];
  rows[0] = Utilities.formatDate(daysAgo7, "GMT+8", "MM/dd")+"~"+Utilities.formatDate(today, "GMT+8", "MM/dd");
  rows[1] = fetchCrashFreeUsersRate("iOS", Utilities.formatDate(daysAgo7, "GMT+8", "yyyy-MM-dd"), Utilities.formatDate(today, "GMT+8", "yyyy-MM-dd"));
  rows[2] = fetchCrashFreeUsersRate("android", Utilities.formatDate(daysAgo7, "GMT+8", "yyyy-MM-dd"), Utilities.formatDate(today, "GMT+8", "yyyy-MM-dd"));
  sheet.appendRow(rows);
}

function fetchCrashFreeUsersRate(platform = "iOS", startDate = "30daysAgo", endDate = "today") {
  const dimensionPlatform = AnalyticsData.newDimension();
  dimensionPlatform.name = "platform";

  const metric = AnalyticsData.newMetric();
  metric.name = "crashFreeUsersRate";

  const dateRange = AnalyticsData.newDateRange();
  dateRange.startDate = startDate;
  dateRange.endDate = endDate;

  const filterExpression = AnalyticsData.newFilterExpression();
  const filter = AnalyticsData.newFilter();
  filter.fieldName = "platform";
  const stringFilter = AnalyticsData.newStringFilter()
  stringFilter.value = platform;
  stringFilter.matchType = "EXACT";
  filter.stringFilter = stringFilter;
  filterExpression.filter = filter;

  const request = AnalyticsData.newRunReportRequest();
  request.dimensions = [dimensionPlatform];
  request.metrics = [metric];
  request.dateRanges = dateRange;
  request.dimensionFilter = filterExpression;

  const report = AnalyticsData.Properties.runReport(request, "properties/" + propertyId);

  return parseFloat(report.rows[0].metricValues[0].value) * 100;
}
```


Click the "Run or Debug" button above to execute "execute" again.


![](/assets/793cb8f89b72/1*tO7f0t5if6Db_eiv5BLOUQ.png)


Return to Google Sheets, and the data has been successfully added!
#### Add Trigger for Automatic Execution


![](/assets/793cb8f89b72/1*MGO4FhC_8N8ul9dXZRYaMg.jpeg)


Select the clock button on the left -> Click "+ Add Trigger" at the bottom right.


![](/assets/793cb8f89b72/1*EArxafXakAcfuPWcr1wtIg.png)

- For the first function, select "execute"
- For the time-based trigger, you can choose the weekly timer to track and add data once a week


After setting, click Save.
### Completion

From now on, the tracking of App Crash-Free Users Rate data will be fully automated; no manual queries or entries are needed; everything will be handled automatically by the machine!


> We only need to focus on solving the App Crash issues! 





> _p.s. Unlike the previous article that required payment for querying data using Big Query, this article queries Crash-Free Users Rate and Google Apps Script completely free of charge, so you can use it with confidence._
