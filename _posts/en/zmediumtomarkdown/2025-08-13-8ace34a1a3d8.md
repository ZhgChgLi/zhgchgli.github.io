Gwangandaegyo Bridge

#### Background

Last year, during the [**2024 "Second Visit to Kyushu 9-Day Free Travel, Entering via Busan→Hakata Cruise"**](../cb65fd5ab770/), I entered Japan through Busan, South Korea, and took a ship to Fukuoka. That time, I only spent a morning in Busan, briefly visiting Haedong Yonggungsa Temple and Haeundae. This July–August, with some free time from work, I set out again to explore Busan more deeply, this time with my equally free-spirited Pinkoi colleague, Sean.

Date: 2025/07/29–08/05

### TL;DR

Summary: Although Busan, South Korea, lacks the quietness and orderliness of Japan, it offers a relaxed atmosphere and warmth from its people.

**Must-Visit Attractions:**

### Pre-Trip Preparation

Price: **NT$6,728 / person**.

Total days: 8 days, actual travel days: 6 days (the first and last days are mostly for flights).

#### Transportation Card

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*AnOi_kWaK4ET_udnUwB6nQ.png)

![[KKday Physical Transportation Card](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/18161-t-money-public-transit-card-pick-up-at-taiwan-taoyuan-international-airport-south-korea?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*TwuSm6wAS-J7_s6nLrnKLg.png)

[KKday Physical Transit Card](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/18161-t-money-public-transit-card-pick-up-at-taiwan-taoyuan-international-airport-south-korea?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}

This year, iPhone can directly use the Tmoney transit card in the Apple Wallet for easy top-up and use; however, I had already [topped up a physical card bought last year](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/18161-t-money-public-transit-card-pick-up-at-taiwan-taoyuan-international-airport-south-korea?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}, so I didn't use it.

Starting this year, you can also top up the transportation card directly through the [Wowpass App](https://wowpass.io/zh-TW){:target="_blank"}. The process involves first loading funds into Wowpass using a credit card, then transferring the balance from Wowpass to Tmoney. This method has more steps and requires paying a handling fee.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*C5s-bq9vOTiwDkIIbGHQig.jpeg)

> For any type, it is recommended to top up in Taiwan using a credit card before the trip (as some machines may only support certain card issuers) or bring some cash to Korea to top up at the machines. [Naver Map](https://map.naver.com/p/){:target="_blank"}

#### Bus Regulations

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*SdjC7IxAtx08bLLFngwnzA.png)

- **Bus rules in Busan: Carry-on luggage larger than 20 inches and handheld tumblers are not allowed (holding them without drinking is also prohibited; they will stop you).**

- For buses, always **board through the front door and exit through the rear door**; the card reader at the front door is usually located behind the driver's seat.

- **Also, stores do not accept outside trash, so if you bring your own iced drinks, it's best to finish them and dispose of the cups at the attraction or department store before leaving, otherwise it can be troublesome.**

- For two or more people, you can freely take taxis. Busan has many taxis that are cheap, new, and very convenient.

- Please confirm the direction before entering the subway station

- One less blue spot (Did not visit Taejongdae)

- I rode the Haeundae Coastal Train once each day over two days.

#### Busan Yacht Tour Y Holic Reservation ⚠️

To use the Busan Pass for the Busan Yacht Tour, you need to make a reservation with the boat operator first. We chose Y Holic as an example.

**After purchasing the Pass, contact the boat operator through the following channels:**

```
IG: @yachtholic_info (We contacted through Line)
LINE: @yachtholic
Email: yh@yachtholic.com
WeChat: yachtholic
```

Number of people, date, time slot, email or contact information, and the QR code of the Busan Pass.

Waiting for confirmation. Once approved, the reservation is successful!

- Night sessions (18:00) require **an additional 5,000 KRW per person**, which can be paid on-site or transferred in advance.

- **Arrive 30 minutes early to line up for identity verification**

- We planned to watch the sunset around 18:30.

> [*If you don't want to buy the Pass, you can directly book the yacht tour.*](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/134684-yacht-holic-busan-yacht-public-tour-gwangan-ri-haeundae-south-korea?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}

#### [Busan, South Korea｜Haeundae Blue Line Park Coastal Train & Sky Capsule Train Ticket](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/123012-haeundae-blueline-park-sky-capsule-beach-train-ticket?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}

#### [Naver Map](https://map.naver.com/p/){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*PrUwaqdQWWW0uvNzc6NnLQ.png)

> [***Always use Naver Map in Korea.***](https://map.naver.com/p/){:target="_blank"}

**Interlude — Discovered My Naver Map Account Was Locked the Day Before Departure**

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*0SzoLbnn_g-Nu1Gx0aYF9Q.png)

![<https://help.naver.com/service/5640/contents/20783?lang=en&osType=COMMONOS>{:target="_blank"}](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*vjnO23ajw0h8XUZ5LBhryw.png)

<https://help.naver.com/service/5640/contents/20783?lang=en&osType=COMMONOS>{:target="_blank"}

**The reason is suspected to be that logging in from Taiwan triggered Naver's account protection mechanism due to suspicious activity.**

You can reactivate the account through identity verification, but I'm not sure if it's because I forgot what name to enter or if foreigners cannot pass the real-name verification. No matter what I input, it always shows incorrect information, and eventually, the account gets permanently locked.

According to [online information](https://www.dcard.tw/f/korea_study/p/257877877){:target="_blank"}, you can fill out the form to request lifting the protection measure " [Members residing outside of Korea_Request to lift account protection measures](https://help.naver.com/inquiry/input.help?categoryNo=18202&serviceNo=5640&lang=en){:target="_blank"}", but I was unsure about the name issue, so my first application was rejected:

![Appeal Failed](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*lc5k61s4A4CBsVQ7ZYBOKg.png)

Appeal Failed

For the second time, I [directly went to the Help Center](https://help.naver.com/inquiry/input.help?categoryNo=14955&serviceNo=5640&lang=ko){:target="_blank"} to fill out the application form:

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*Mn_YZfHr9U8tXKYCjySHVg.png)

The content of the complaint I entered:

```
1. Your NAVER ID.
Your Naver account. If you forget your ID, you can recover it using your email or phone number.

2. The registered name, date of birth, and contact information (mobile phone number or email address) of your NAVER ID.
Date of birth: YYYY/MM/DD The birthday you registered
Mobile Number: +886XXXXXXXXX The phone number you registered
Email: The email you registered
Registered Name: Sorry, I really forgot which name I entered; it may be one of the following:
Possible name combinations you want to verify
XXXXX LI
LI XXXXX
XXX
李XX
but my real first name is XXXX, last name is Li

3. Attach your overseas identification card.
As attached file.

4. The details of your request to the NAVER Help Center.
I forgot the name I entered and want to lift the account protection measures.
```

The more information you can provide, the better. Finally, attach a file with a photo of the passport personal data page.

**Then it was successfully unlocked:**

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*uvUo0CgFkqTfuOp87UtahQ.png)

You will receive a temporary password email. Use the temporary password to log into Naver Map. **Remember to change your password and enable two-factor authentication login (because we disabled Naver's login protection mechanism).**

> *Naver's response is quite fast, usually resolving issues within half a day; if you're worried about being locked out unexpectedly, you can first apply for " [Members residing outside of Korea_Request to lift account protection measures](https://help.naver.com/inquiry/input.help?categoryNo=18202&serviceNo=5640&lang=en){:target="_blank"} " (* [Refer to this guide](https://www.dcard.tw/f/korea_study/p/257877877){:target="*blank"} _).*

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*QzSioHsBFjr_LBpX2NlgWw.jpeg)

Because we had to head straight to the hotel after landing in Busan, we ate a full meal in Taiwan beforehand.

#### 15:00 Start waiting for the flight, activate eSIM

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*AXE6WNQdcgDXCFuGn7k5PA.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*QbB73S1hJj3Buwzqf8wdSw.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*HjfYqKBHDe5_c0iF7QaHuw.jpeg)

The accommodation is located near Haeundae Traditional Market, which sells a variety of food.

#### ~=23:30 Return to the hotel to start eating

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*vQBulLYRFkoUQC_Os4hPFw.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*SyBfYDcG8uh5ArLioXV9vg.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*My3vIyTLBNbTSDtfh4FtkA.jpeg)

Finally bought BBQ fried chicken in two flavors, spicy rice cakes from the traditional market, and alcohol from the convenience store.

> *One order of fried chicken is enough for two people; two orders are too much (feels like four orders in Taiwan). Actually paid NT $1,210.*

> *This mango wine (* Iced tea highball with mango cubes *) is delicious (5%). It contains canned mango pieces, and I later found out that Taiwan's FamilyMart also sells it.*

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*Yf9ZxEjhX1K-YMwhTaDgFw.jpeg)

There is a bus right at the hotel entrance that goes directly to Skyline Luge.

#### 10:25 Skyline Luge 👍👍👍

Around 10:30, we started queuing to exchange the voucher (the Busan Pass must be exchanged before use). There were quite a few people, and we waited about 20 minutes to get the tickets. The Busan Pass allows you to choose between riding the luge twice or riding the luge once and the zipline once. Most people chose to ride the luge twice.

> [*If you haven't bought the Pass, you can purchase tickets on KKday first.*](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/152412-gijang-skyline-luge-ticket-busan-south-korea?cid=19365){:target="*blank"} _**(Cheaper than buying on-site, but you still need to exchange the ticket to enter)***

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*_V9oQVANR9ncErO9tWEsCw.png)

After exchanging the ticket, go next door to choose a helmet that fits your size. Once you wear the helmet, you can take the cable car up.

#### ~=11:00 Take the Cable Car

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*PT-mGar4So6od4dD3A6F5g.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*YzED-cEVaw7wrylcSUjuKw.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*YHu8QYJ2Cx1grupJ55ZmsQ.png)

People gather at the station to exchange or buy tickets. There is hardly any queue for the cable car and luge ride afterward. During the cable car ride, you can see the track below. It takes about 5 minutes to reach the starting point.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*doGVKHy5yunEpR7OFaa6rw.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*f0KgbnLu921Hiq7QAZg5HQ.jpeg)

If you are afraid of open-style cable cars, I saw another box-type cable car next to it that seems to be opening soon(?).

#### 11:05 Ready to Depart

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*QmbycT8d2Gh5wimLP18CPQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*SA-bWwl8EuFsllB6_O5IrA.jpeg)

You can overlook the adjacent Lotte World.

For the first ride, they will stamp your hand and staff will provide a brief tutorial.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*UCPhQh3lnSwMiO9UBqoHDQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*loe9DLrp_dtUFnpYrwxAOw.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*i9BnnhpabwgnxuBDw_7dbA.png)

The operation method is basically:

- **Legs Straight**

- **Move Backward, Brake Forward**

- Do not stop midway, do not stop midway, do not stop midway; if you stop completely, it becomes very hard to keep sliding.

- Slow down before turning to avoid flipping over.

- Be Careful When Overtaking

- **Both hands must control; holding the phone is not allowed. There will be opportunities for photos by cameras along the way, and you can purchase them at the souvenir shop.**

- Be careful not to lose your personal belongings.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*GGsBBz5201M0fOrH4T1sqQ.png)

Scrolling from top to bottom takes about 6 minutes.

Next are the souvenir center and the place where you can buy photos taken along the way.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*17zdVTPo_LP48TizhwValw.png)

Pass through the souvenir center back to the entrance, then line up again for the cable car.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*I0y7aZ0bpynBInkP18lcUQ.png)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*2Y0iQTWf9pE0fAZJEK7JDg.jpeg)

This time, we lined up at the entrance gate (you can play directly without staff instruction).

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*1aOU7IAPVNd6bSLNTaXRsw.png)

Hsheng.

#### 11:45 Depart, head to Haedong Yonggungsa Temple

After exiting Skyline Luge, walk straight across the street to reach Haedong Yonggungsa Temple. It takes about 10 minutes on an uphill path.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*W8pHXqKZ-gEPUqqLQV7cSA.jpeg)

#### 11:55 Haedong Yonggungsa Temple

Because we [**visited last year**](../cb65fd5ab770/), this time we just took a brief look around.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*QO6ie1PN4o8liIjIs2Y0qQ.png)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*5RNxsL0nD0TQ3I_UvwZQPg.png)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*NllO9Hy73kJQzWNGoW0ABA.png)

Arrived at the entrance of Haedong Yonggungsa Temple street vendors around 11:55.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*m-tact5LRxGmwTBeDj7D2w.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*K2ByL3USjy1fUlipsZLv1g.png)

This time I discovered that you can also enter Haedong Yonggungsa Temple from the right side of the signboard entrance, which is a gentle slope leading directly to the main hall; the signboard entrance has very steep stairs and is difficult to climb.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*dyci1YPm-ApaeV2MDLsW2Q.jpeg)

#### 12:45 Waiting for the bus to Songjeong Station

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*hnGZPnjF3eIAeAp7nu-Seg.png)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*05IR75W3B-T4g2QkInLjHg.jpeg)

Busan has effective summer cooling measures. There are umbrellas at traffic lights, and most bus stops have fans that can be turned on by pressing a button.

#### The route plan is shown in the image below:

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*wbyHE15DgoW3_pkit_OR_A.png)

Take the bus and walk from Skyline Luge to Songjeong Station of the Coastal Train, then take the Coastal Train to Cheongsapo Station, and transfer to the Capsule Train back to Haeundae.

#### ~=13:15 Arrive at Songjeong Station

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*1W63YJR27-niR0rPFiNkdw.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*qKTgaE6w7QYNnHU41kgdRg.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*E1rZoLfWgHKUxb3qRAXhkg.jpeg)

It's about a 10-minute walk from the bus stop, very hot and sunny.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*uQegRUm5OVql_OGz5L4TQg.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*PvM5nguf_-Fv6NfoWztP-w.jpeg)

[ref](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/123012-haeundae-blueline-park-sky-capsule-beach-train-ticket?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}

The 13:30 slot was full, so we booked the 14:00 slot. ( [Schedule](http://m.site.naver.com/0URl8){:target="_blank"} )

> *Side note: The staff at this station did not accept the Busan Pass PDF file and insisted that we show the voucher via the KKday App.*

> *The Busan Pass ticket allows one boarding per station on the same day, so you can actually stop at various attractions along the route.*

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*mCtniHyCFiDVmGqsr8fFfw.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*LBR8tx9HfigYr51-ih8dag.jpeg)

It was still early, so we first grabbed a bite at a convenience store; right outside Songjeong Station is Songjeong Beach (which seemed less crowded), and there is a convenience store nearby.

#### ~=13:40 Start waiting for the bus

Remember to line up early for the bus, or you'll end up standing in the last row.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*wMw1Bmz47wE2_ivQ4LtQAw.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*_jexN3EvstbOgkts27zQhg.jpeg)

After exiting the station, walk straight to the platform. You can start waiting for the train after ticket inspection at the platform entrance.

Around 13:50, the vehicle will arrive, and the crowd starts to stir and line up.

#### ~=14:00 Departure

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*HT17e69lak7tbTqoXCpVUg.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*QBfTvy19T_Jl6zvxVNDqfQ.jpeg)

Sitting in the second row, the view was quite nice.

#### ~=14:15 Arrive at Cheongsapo

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*xeOjrCl9pQx_u28XnJXELA.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*6JA5jGLBfsMl2GJMmehhtw.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*H0sBRecqIdECSploIAYVpw.jpeg)

After getting off, you will see the stairs to the 2nd floor on the platform, which is the boarding area for the Capsule Train.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*Y4jeQwk6jnpsbAklaKZI6g.png)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*XDAIgiQb3qdEDSr546kNzg.png)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*hrnYxziizbB6PrFv97Qiow.jpeg)

Open the [link in the KKday order voucher](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/123012-haeundae-blueline-park-sky-capsule-beach-train-ticket?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} to access the ticket voucher. After going upstairs, show the voucher to the staff at the pavilion (we booked the 14:30–15:00 time slot). They will give you a number tag. When your number is called, you can board. If the calling has already started, you must wait until all numbers are called.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*KCbwTzka0L2cWDvX2O37iQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*FjPJSkqC67-UAhlwm9RRzA.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*5Tx02qf1e3U_IKWJaWjp8g.jpeg)

During the wait, I went to the souvenir shop next door and bought a fan.

> *The capsule train also provides free fans (shown in the far right picture).*

#### ~=14:30 Queue for Capsule Train Number Calling

When the time is up, the staff will start calling numbers in order for queuing.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*ZPQgbN2k7kRG2KI-3YEfEA.png)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*7S7dQYAf2Zqj_dxMjl_pDw.jpeg)

There is air conditioning above the queuing area. The voucher will be verified just before boarding (remember to have it ready). After boarding, the staff will take a group photo. Then, after getting off, you can decide whether to purchase the photo from them.

#### ~=14:40 Capsule Train from Cheongsapo -> Upo (Haeundae) Departure! 👍👍👍

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*fLpUWvXcdl3Ryc1ary_arQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*nMQDysR6bNzOxVTLLU7rPQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*l1JWUq3qAKEyDoyLJyzSPQ.jpeg)

Looks thrilling, but actually moves slowly; there’s no air conditioning inside the cabin, but it has a fan and a speaker where you can plug in your phone to play music.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*w4zPWlwQcqHhF4WCokBVyQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*67tHAjdjNoZLmHdg0bLZFw.jpeg)

Enjoy the scenery along the way and take some trendy photos (?)

#### ~=15:10 Arrive at Uipo (Haeundae)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*hTEuxliIs2s_098pdVaOsg.png)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*mrsat28nAJ7e1PWJcb-KMQ.png)

Head toward the Haeundae direction (tall buildings) and come out to the intersection. On the opposite right side is the famous and delicious [Salt Bread — Jayeondo saltbread](https://naver.me/x9zcuKNm){:target="_blank"} (will come back to buy later). On the left, walk straight down to the sea-facing entrance, which is the Busan Sky entrance.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*mxRI19obHDJEYWgaWpLC4g.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*kG7OMT38Kq5n4inz0Zi1VQ.jpeg)

#### ~=15:35 Busan BUSAN X the SKY

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*wLhiiMFHth1q0M0I52w0BQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*4GZH5tai41pbv0WbydQBzQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*MZtM_pbelaE_9DSkReik6Q.jpeg)

The glass facing Haeundae Beach has a barrier, so you can't take photos close to it.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*LphemYMPN0KncWvpEvv-5w.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*59D8d2G9l56zMvbn3yw55Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*Naj3fWNQzQthcPQJvr3onA.jpeg)

There is a transparent glass floor bridge, but the glass is heavily worn, so the effect is mediocre; there is also a transparent glass restroom.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*-H0j9zTeDr4mJ6Cqk3wWfA.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*8kH5BBvg3v0xYPxl-NknSw.jpeg)

Walking down to the café and souvenir shop, you can look back at the capsule train route you just came from.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*89JfpBVVoL3GcEbkqqMNyQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*3MGWqKezW4zdue_uNECOWw.jpeg)

Ate a fish cake sausage stick to replenish energy (taste was so-so).

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*--lNPiay_O4al6tfX5spwg.jpeg)

Besides cafes and souvenir shops, this floor also has free exhibitions.

#### ~=16:00 Leave and walk back to buy [Salt Bread — Jayeondo saltbread](https://naver.me/x9zcuKNm){:target="_blank"} 👍👍👍

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*w9_aMzKXaNfaz_haZN-XIw.png)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*O8DuQ0ywuuN5fxZXc_0_JQ.jpeg)

One order contains 6 pieces. We bought one to share back at the hotel. The combination of fragrant, crispy, and a slight touch of salt for flavor made it very delicious.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*2oV0hKVku4_AgQI7cf_cag.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*8-6mY9FWINdMJiYxpfPZEQ.jpeg)

There are many large-scale construction and renovation projects in Haeundae, seemingly preparing for the 2030 World Expo bid (which has already failed).

> *Return to the hotel to rest, then go to Mijeanwang for dinner in the evening.*

#### 17:50 Arrive at [Matchandeul Salted Grill Haeundae Branch](https://naver.me/5sG3vEe5){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*AsOMjouHVz3BRue3olauuw.png)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*52iHV2Dv0vDDxNuqJxYmhg.png)

There is a machine at the entrance for waiting. Enter your email to receive a notification. At 17:50, a small queue started to form.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*PQL9i8rdeGLZD0rNLEaLxw.png)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*NNmf9vfpx9sX-EPv-6-MCQ.jpeg)

Click the button to check your current number. You will also receive an entry notification email when it's your turn, which is very convenient; **also, be careful as the building opposite and next door are under construction.**

#### 18:25 Enter for Dinner

It took about more than 30 minutes to enter.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*7MgY9p6aZMbGejj56iU11A.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*1dn6e5L69VTVnrcEfhMvDw.jpeg)

We directly ordered the double set (includes one portion of each meat + soybean paste soup + rice pot) and a bottle of Cass beer, costing about NT$1,500.

> *They will grill it well for you. Reviews say the meat is tasty but the portion is small and you need to wait in line.*

#### ~=20:30 Return to Haeundae Main Street after dinner

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*O2UXV7D8gKQ0hImc8iDnMA.png)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*YINokSS0bT-ebB5VXJhW_w.png)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*PjSGfzXsbc9bYFb1sK18Tw.png)

Strolled along Haeundae Beach Road to digest a bit and bought ice cream from a matcha specialty shop as a dessert to refresh.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*eEqklwquew6rGg4-Il6FUw.png)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*XIW1F6tF8P0ExjjlixWKxQ.png)

Next door is the newly opened Olive Young Delight Project store, where we did some shopping; many items are buy two get one free, and you can get an instant tax refund on-site for purchases over 15,000 KRW.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*9eNytaAkCGcIgbOzagwTiQ.png)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*hW_N_93CpyyzWCGZ-OtJ4Q.png)

Went for a walk at Haeundae Beach again before heading back to the hotel to rest.

### Day 3 07/31 (Thu) Cheongsapo, Spa Land, Coastal Train, Busan Yacht Tour

Because yesterday we only transferred at Cheongsapo without exploring, we came again today.

#### 11:00 Took the bus to Cheongsapo

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*rbpv52Shw77IaUdT2d7-8w.png)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*DJj6wZCG0KRomyT94xO1lA.jpeg)

The bus from Haeundae directly to Cheongsapo is a small bus. It passes through communities like Busan Sanso, where the roads are narrow and steep.

#### 11:30 Arrive at Cheongsapo

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*fRTe_hokNNcPNgX97qZcQw.png)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*77MdQpIY5lupV8oQ3chyDw.png)

Nearby, we randomly found a restaurant for lunch ([Gohyang katsu](https://naver.me/GlGmYxyY){:target="_blank"}). I ordered a pork cutlet sandwich; the meat was thick, tender, and reasonably priced.

#### ~=12:30 [DIART COFFEE Honey Butter Toast](https://naver.me/GkUJQI6r){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*Su_kwIRgZb18zoMS0Tv0sw.png)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*6kxh55_key4KL-Tj5V5WNQ.jpeg)

After lunch, we walked out to the highly recommended Busan Honey Butter Toast at [DIART COFFEE](https://naver.me/GkUJQI6r){:target="_blank"}. We ordered one toast (₩10,000) and coffee (₩5,500) to take a break.

For how to eat, you can refer to the [card](https://m.site.naver.com/1Abyy){:target="_blank"}. In short, cut the bread into pieces first, then evenly spread butter and honey before eating.

> *The honey is not too sweet, combined with creamy butter and crispy bread, making it delicious without being greasy.*

#### ~=13:30 Return to Cheongsapo to catch the coastal train back to Wi-po (Haeundae)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*W-yaVbvzi87W8xZk_cza4g.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*VKTdBhWwiPmOoE4eX7pwVw.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*fWJrPrMNalY2YbTFk9ct0Q.png)

Yesterday's ticket was no longer valid, so I used the Busan Pass to exchange for another coastal train ticket; since this is a mid-station boarding point, I could only stand in the last row.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*_a9Gqyx5xSatuoqZVvDwPQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*6ypVO-ZjcG0zkZAuJKC7Mg.jpeg)

There were several observation decks along the way, but we didn't get off because it was too hot.

#### ~=13:55 Arrive at Oe-po (Haeundae)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*viDnwtL1r7EWe3K1FtDKiA.jpeg)

After returning to Haeundae, we walked and took a bus to Shinsegae Spa Land.

#### ~=14:30 Arrive at [Shinsegae Department Store](https://naver.me/xfYRYAfu){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*ZqGLAD3UKpURs3HKbviTwQ.png)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*WneX4dSsqbfvEps927Zqjw.png)

Skipped shopping, headed straight to Spa Land on the first floor.

#### 14:40 Spa Land

Redeem Spa Land using the Busan Pass.

> [*You can also purchase it in advance on Kkday without buying the Pass.*](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/12213-busan-spa-land-centum-city-ticket?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}

Upon entry, you will receive a sensor wristband. Use the wristband to store your shoes and clothes. Inside, change into the special clothing for the sauna. You can also visit the sauna first (full nudity required) before going to the sweat sauna. The sweat sauna entrance is in the direction of the women's changing room.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*2UvncJZg2YqeC9pmzSstww.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*rgOo09p9c0DJFD9h_UH7fQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*9oMyMc4jYnkhHcJKydzXJw.jpeg)

The first floor has a sunbathing area, nail salon, snack stalls, and various types of jjimjilbang (sauna rooms) (very crowded during summer vacation, almost all are full). The third floor has a restaurant (where you can eat grilled eggs and instant noodles), massage services, massage chairs, and a yoga room.

After the sauna, we went to the sunbathing area to lie down and soak up the sun, ordering a drink (very sweet).

> *All purchases inside the venue are made by scanning the wristband, with payment settled upon exit.*

> ***Honestly, I didn't get to experience the sweat sauna this time because it was insanely crowded. I'll try it next time.***

#### 17:00 Prepare to meet at the yacht pier

For the 18:30 session, you need to arrive early for roll call at the meeting point.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*I05lgEC-kLYtbw1s_OWJ6Q.jpeg)

Before departure, we grabbed some food to fill up at Shinsegae Department Store B1.

#### Take the subway to Dongbaek Station (Dongbaek)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*nLZyTcQcoS4NBTV_EozYFA.png)

After exiting the station, it takes about 15 minutes on foot to reach the pier.

> *The pier area only has vending machines and restrooms, which are dirtier and crowded with queues; **it is recommended to buy what you need and use the restroom in the city before coming here.***

About 20 minutes later, we will arrive at the waters in front of Gwangalli Beach, where many visitors are playing SUP. We will stop here to set off fireworks; the fireworks are lit by the crew members of various yachts sailing during this time, but since it is still bright, they are not very visible.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*--tFcHDWgpPDD__zrK8Jlg.jpeg)

There are many seats inside the store, so no need to wait in line; we just walked in.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*R-kS0zI7e106d0e2SAaMKg.jpeg)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*CHuWZKV3-zp9Z5vDy3h2kQ.jpeg)

We ordered grilled eel, grilled beef slices, two cold noodles, and draft beer, totaling NT$2,387.

Grilled eel is crispy, tender, and juicy, very delicious with no fishy smell at all; grilled beef slices are good but ordinary; the cold buckwheat noodles resemble brown sugar shaved ice but actually have a soy sauce flavor with crushed ice, making it refreshing and tasty.

After eating, we strolled along Haeundae Street, visited Haeundae Traditional Market (forgot to try the seafood pancake, so frustrating!), and bought some souvenirs. Tomorrow we will leave Haeundae.

#### ~=11:00 Lunch — [Hongkong 0410 Nampo 1st Branch](https://naver.me/G28VhTtY){:target="_blank"}

Near noon, we casually picked a restaurant inside BIFF for lunch. This one serves Korean-Chinese cuisine.

Ordered fried dumplings, sweet and sour pork (medium, but a small size might be better), and Korean-style jajangmyeon.

Fried dumplings are a bit greasy, but the sweet and sour pork is good.

#### 12:15 Take the bus + walk to Songdo Cable Car Station

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*O-7uqMkqeEY_hnPImCZ4nA.png)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*G55PQci1BikM7kS7jRyBUg.jpeg)

After getting off the bus, there's about a 10-minute walk. It's too hot, so let's first go to the convenience store to get a self-made iced latte to cool down.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*9hyji_BcmpmX8mnbQ_8sYg.png)

After entering, line up at the counter to exchange your Busan Pass for the cable car ticket (the Pass is for the crystal cabin, **round trip, so keep the ticket safe**).

After getting the ticket, take the escalator upstairs to line up for the cable car. (They gave out lollipops, but I didn’t take one)

#### 12:25 Board the vehicle

There is no shade here at all, and it's very sunny under the strong sun. You can get a bird's-eye view of the entire Songdo Cable Car.

#### ~=13:00 Return to Songdo Cable Car, line up for the cable car back

#### ~=13:25 Leave Songdo and walk back to take the bus

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*RCy2E4mmH3saWnKRoc7xWg.jpeg)

There is also an observation deck near the cable car, but we skipped it because it was too hot.

Walk back to the bus stop, return to the city, and then transfer to a minibus to Gamcheon Culture Village.

We didn't plan to take photos, just visiting spots; it felt like a rainbow village with some cafes. We walked through quickly and took the bus back to the hotel from another bus stop.

> *The buses here are minibuses, similar to those in Yangmingshan. The drivers are aggressive, and the buses are crowded with many passengers.*

#### ~=17:40 Departing for dinner

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*DZdWxcnw-93O_23CzoNHGg.jpeg)

- The unique feature is that the grill plate is a pot lid.

- The side dishes include a piece of vitamin C (I checked, and taking vitamin C before or after BBQ can reduce free radicals and lower the risk of cancer).

- At least order three servings of meat, each grilled by the staff and served to you.

- Ordered two pork, one beef, two bowls of instant noodles, and Cass beer. Each meat portion costs 18,000 KRW. **The total was NT$1,060, which is very affordable, and the meat was delicious!! Highly recommended.**

#### ~= 18:30 Walk to Busan Tower

After eating, walk all the way to Busan Tower to digest, which takes about 20 minutes.

You can scan the QR code on the Busan Tower ticket to play a puzzle game. Solving all the codes will earn you a small prize. (I have written the codes later.)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*JnjlJkLecp-f0MseLSVbwQ.png)

There were already many people waiting when we arrived.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*kUe5ECb7bsWp_Qwh2hlEug.jpeg)

Before going down the mountain, remember to go to the unmanned ticket machine (Ticket Box) outside:

- Enter password: `19731121` (Busan Tower construction date)

- You can use the pass to redeem small prizes at the souvenir center outside the blue house (not the one on the first floor of Busan Tower).

#### A small souvenir is a card, available in various styles. I chose a transparent Busan Tower card:

Strolled around the shopping street and found an HBAF almond specialty store, which seems to have the most complete range of flavors. Bought the Yellow combo pack (with small packets inside) along with some unique flavors (like popping candy, which really pops, and spicy stir-fried rice cakes) and popular flavors (honey, Oreo, corn) as souvenirs to take home.

#### 20:45 Return to — BIFF Square to buy late-night snacks

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*hGy9kfVNX80z2gYTpXsO1A.png)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*I2_vOk86JV7s2IcRV4nwAw.jpeg)

There are many street vendors here, and the floor has celebrities' handprints.

Finally bought and ate:

- Makgeolli: Similar to millet wine or fermented rice wine, very good.

- BHC Boneless Fried Chicken: The seasoning and chicken are tender and very delicious.

#### 00:00 Good night, Nampo

Around 10:XX, head out. Lotte Department Store opens at 10:30, so walk there slowly.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*9fHXV2Og6JodL5Pjad3JDg.jpeg)

First, head to the B1 food court café for a quick breakfast. (So-so, the coffee is Lungo)

#### 11:30 Start wandering around the department store randomly

- Bought several clothes at the Kodak store (on average NT$300–$500 cheaper than Taiwan proxy shopping).  
  The store offers direct tax refund.

- Bought a handheld fan  
  Use the receipt to find the tax refund machine in the B1 food court to print the tax refund form, then go to the airport to get cash refund. (About NT$60 refund)

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*TxOTSeqke8P2TE0MWWgiPA.jpeg)

- The water dance show starts every hour from 11 AM at the department store. It's quite spectacular.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*1BHaKNhjT3BIOkW4-qnE4g.jpeg)

After getting tired from walking, we went to B1 at noon to eat Downtown Burgers; I get the reasoning, but American-style burgers also offer kimchi!

After eating, we strolled around the department store's rooftop observatory (very sunny and hot).

It's very sunny outside, and the crowd grows larger as it gets closer to 14:00; at this time, **an ajumma came over and told us that from 8/2 to 8/30, due to the heat, the event was moved to 20:00!! Shocked!!** Then everyone started spreading the word that it was changed to 20:00, and people began to slowly disperse.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*QpYPLAIoTGVwYHZoYljzGQ.png)

After searching for a long time, I finally found the tax refund machine on a small alley next to Din Tai Fung.

- If it's not an immediate tax refund, you need to scan the receipt barcode here to get the tax refund form, and finally receive the refund at the airport. (A bit troublesome)

> ***I just learned that Korea has different tax refund agencies: Global Blue, GLOBAL TAX FREE, Easy Tax Refund, CubeRefund, and eTAX FREE, and you can only use the corresponding refund machines*** *; I saw a cash refund machine at Olive Young that was GLOBAL TAX FREE, but my receipt is CubeRefund, so I still have to get the refund at the airport.*

#### 16:35 Return to hotel to rest

After getting tired from walking, I went to B1 to buy Korean red beans and peach snacks, along with a convenience store shake made with an old recipe (iced cup + banana milk + unsweetened black coffee). Then I walked back to the hotel through the underground shopping street to rest.

#### 19:00 Leave the hotel to visit BIFF Olive Young for a stroll

I didn’t get to explore Haeundae earlier, so since I had some time, I came to check it out. This store is very big, with many staff who are all very friendly.

There was a projection introducing the history of Yeongdo Bridge, but possibly due to the projector angle issue on the first day, it was hard to see clearly.

#### 20:15 The bridge lowered again, traffic resumed

- Waited for about 20 minutes

- Ordered a ham and cheese omelette toast + hash browns + iced coffee: 8,400 KRW

> *It's good, but I think some brunch spots in Taiwan taste better than this.*

After several days of heavy-flavored food, I wanted something lighter for lunch.

- Rice must be ordered separately.

- It has little to no flavor.

After eating, we strolled around a bit more.

#### 12:50 Leave Lotte Department Store and head to [Sky Eye Observatory — Yeongju Haneul Nun Observatory](https://naver.me/xYvTULtB){:target="_blank"}

Wandering nearby with no particular plan, I found an [observation deck I missed last year](../cb65fd5ab770/). There’s a direct bus (21 minutes), so I went there.

- Only recommend: Blueberry Yogurt Smoothie, available in 600ML or 1,000ML sizes; tasty and refreshing without being too sweet or thirst-inducing. Price is about 4,300 KRW.

The canned food market has many stalls selling dried goods, groceries, and seafood (like a traditional market), covering a large area.

#### Bupyeong Canned Food Market — [Milgot](https://naver.me/GEiuXPsf){:target="_blank"} Red Bean Cream Mugwort Rice Cake 👍

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*R14q-E0U_yWC9iXarLhRZg.jpeg)

It is probably the most famous store in the canned market, known for its specialty — red bean cream mugwort rice cake.

- Because I don't speak Korean, I just took a photo and showed it directly to the staff to order this.

- The staff said it should be kept frozen, and it's best to defrost it for half an hour to an hour before eating.

- Also bought a savory bread, which was pretty good!

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*GJ8R6Is85xYOA8HOlA_bQg.jpeg)

Later, I took it back to the hotel to eat. The mugwort rice cake has a chewy texture paired with soybean powder and red bean cream filling. I found it quite unique and slightly sweet. If you pass by, you should give it a try!

Also bought another box of [BHC Fried Chicken](https://naver.me/xww9nJx2){:target="_blank"} to have for dinner.

#### 18:30 Depart Again

After resting in the evening, we went out again, mainly to visit Fokcheon Temple for night views. First, we stopped by Baekcheon Bay Cultural Village.

#### 18:45 [Baekcheon Bay Cultural Village](https://naver.me/FgTvHYSL){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*_bg1OXnenjgxXpfoX3xwog.jpeg)

However, since it was late, we only had a brief look around; there are many cafes and small shops along the coast, but maybe because it was late, there were few people. The coastal walkway below was under repair and inaccessible. The weather was cloudy today, so the scenery was not great.

#### 19:00 Head to [Bokcheonsa Temple](https://naver.me/5L7oHSSB){:target="_blank"}

After leaving Baishan Bay, head up towards Foguang Temple.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*7BgsQXSUyo7X3sQnbDpgCQ.jpeg)

Originally, the map showed the bus was only one stop away, so I thought walking would be fine. After a few steps, I gave up; the map said bus 1 stop (1 minute), but walking actually took about 20 minutes (all steep, shaky hills).

- Yeongdogu 1 or 5 are both fine

**Only take one stop to the next station [Sinseon Elementary School](https://naver.me/xzlLlZhM){:target="_blank"}, the rest must be on foot:**

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*O0Q9eorhHVOa5e9W69pK2A.png)

After getting off, I was stunned; it was still a very steep and shaky hillside. From here, walk all the way up:

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*A232HHlbcIoIpCEE770RhA.jpeg)

After passing the elementary school, you will see the entrance to Fokcheon Temple:

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*8ISDSkUNQK1J6SJokF48Zg.jpeg)

This is just the beginning; you still have to climb a very steep and shaky hillside all the way up to reach Bokcheon Temple:

> *Arrived at Bokcheon Temple around 19:25 (almost exhausted). The map said 10 minutes, but since it was all uphill and included breaks, it actually took about 25 minutes.*

But the more tragic thing is — it closed! It closed! It closed!

That's right, Bukhansan Temple is not really a public tourist spot. It is a quiet temple, and the gates close at a certain time. According to a colleague, after around 18:00, you can only enter but not exit. They don't rush people out, but once the gate is closed, no one is allowed in.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*VsLe3FUcx9XaJ8WTVWjlIg.jpeg)

Tragic, we could only view the scenery from the loft outside the station. Later, some visitors who came for the same reason also stood here.

> ***However, seeing us sweating heavily, the abbot threw us two cans of ice water from inside. We were so grateful.***

Finally, I casually took a photo of the night view before heading down the mountain. I originally wanted to come here after seeing photos from other bloggers:

Before heading back to the hotel, I bought the [Seed Sugar Cake](https://naver.me/5eZTZe4y){:target="_blank"} at BIFF Square, where many people were lining up. I found it too oily and sweet, not very impressive.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*dPAGNfr1hlXfTu3CnFl7ng.jpeg)

Around 22:00, it started raining in Busan! Luckily, our trip was almost over.

### Day 7 08/04 (Mon) Busan Seomyeon, Shinsegae Department Store, Korean Beef

In the morning, head out and move to Seomyeon Station.

#### 10:45 Arrive at Seomyeon Station

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*o5yuGlxr94cLNs65fiuL5A.png)

After arriving, we decided to store our luggage directly at the subway station. Other places like Lotte Department Store also offer luggage storage.

> ***Luggage storage here is very expensive: drop off at 10:45 AM, pick up at 8:10 PM.***

> ***Charged 6,000 + 7,000 KRW (about NT$280).***

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*Wc20JDECq1yHn3CgB1qXFA.png)

There is also an Olive Young in the underground shopping area at this station, so we restocked there again.

After shopping until nearly noon, we went to a nearby market to eat Korean-style kalguksu (knife-cut noodles).

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*eELPbEa7ehdgUH6X47-C9A.jpeg)

The menu is very simple, offering only knife-cut noodles and seaweed rolls.

> *We ordered seaweed rolls to share and I had the knife-cut cold noodles. The noodles were chewy and refreshing; the downside was the lack of toppings (meat), making it a plain carb-only dish.*

After eating, walk back to Lotte Department Store.

I found it hard to shop here, or rather, it's even harder to shop than at Lotte Department Store - Gwangbok Branch yesterday. There are fewer floors and fewer stores; **the only advantage is a large public resting area upstairs where you can charge your devices and rest.**

There is also a Busan souvenir shop here, but it has far fewer items than the one in Nampo.

![](/assets/8ace34a1a3d8/1*hSXu5dj5gWdLB99e5TaHXA.jpeg)

After visiting the LEGO store, not knowing where to go next, we decided to take the bus to explore Shinsegae Department Store.

> *Another NC Department Store in Seomyeon has closed. **If you want to shop elsewhere, you might try Jeonpo Coffee Street, which has many small shops (similar to Dongdaegu area), but it may not be very interesting for men.***

There are really many small shops, cafes, and even a ZARA from Tampo to Seomyeon.

#### After returning to Seomyeon Station, go to Lotte Department Store B1 food court to buy food, then prepare to head to the airport hotel

There is also a supermarket here. In the end, we bought this takoyaki to eat back at the hotel, choosing the Korean flavor on the far right.

> *This time, heading in the opposite direction toward Gaya University, also on a Tuesday, it felt like seeing myself who had just arrived in Busan last Tuesday.*

> *This room and bathroom were the largest and best-equipped during the three days, but we only stayed as guests for one day.*

The room window offers a direct view of planes taking off and landing.

Bought peach wine at the convenience store to go with the takoyaki I just got. I think this takoyaki is great. Although it got soft after bringing it back, it's made with black squid ink as the base, combines the crispiness of Taiwanese takoyaki with Korean spicy sauce, and tastes really good. 😋

#### Day 8 08/05 (Tue) Busan Gimhae International Airport, Return Trip

Time flies, and the eight-day trip to Busan is coming to an end. The last day only includes a trip to the airport.

From the hotel, take one stop to reach the airport (about 10 minutes).

After arriving at the airport, go directly to the second floor for international departures.

There are many self-check-in kiosks along the edge of the second floor. You can check in and select seats right here. You can also see that the third floor has many food options and shops.

- Busan Air's free baggage allowance is only 15 KG.

- Check if the portable charger is placed inside a ziplock bag.

- **After checking in your luggage, be sure to wait in that area for 5 minutes to see if there are any issues**  
  That day, someone was repeatedly announced over the PA system because they couldn't be found...

#### ~= 09:30 Departure and Security Check

> *The departure hall is small, with only one row; there are a few duty-free shops, a convenience store, and a café offering limited snacks. (If you're very hungry, make sure to eat outside before passing through departure.)*

> ***Since it is a dual-use military and civilian airport, taking photos of the planes outside is not allowed.***

Not sure what to buy, so I got two cans of GD alcohol from the convenience store to bring back to Taiwan.

#### Delay 11:07 Departure, Early Arrival at 11:58
