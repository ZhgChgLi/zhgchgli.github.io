### Medium One-Year Review

A recap of my one-year journey on Medium, or a summary of 2019.

It’s hard to believe that it has already been a year since I started publishing articles on Medium. Technically, my anniversary should be in October 2019 (the first article was in October 2018); however, I was too busy and lacked inspiration at that time. As we move into 2020, I want to quickly document my experiences from the past year, serving as a summary for 2019!

### Reflection

First, I want to thank [Enther Wu](https://medium.com/u/f211da1977d0){:target="_blank"} and [Chih-Hung Yeh](https://medium.com/u/baaffcc5aecc){:target="_blank"} for encouraging me to reignite my passion for writing. Initially, my articles were more like personal notes about my daily life or work experiences, and the content felt rather empty. However, I shamelessly shared them on social media. Looking back at those early articles now, I feel a bit embarrassed; I didn’t really know what I was writing about, and the content lacked depth.

But everything is part of the growth process. The more I wrote, the more comfortable I became, and my areas of research expanded. I was concerned about misleading others, missing important details, or misunderstanding concepts. Under this pressure, writing became not just a record but a deep exploration of certain issues, leading to my own growth and insights. Consequently, the quality of the content I shared with everyone improved significantly.

The community has been incredibly supportive. At first, I was really afraid of negative feedback that might shake my confidence, but that didn’t happen. The feedback I received was overwhelmingly positive. Even if the content of my articles wasn’t always helpful, this encouragement boosted my confidence in creating and motivated me to invest more time in documenting my thoughts. Thank you all for your support!

The writing experience on Medium is truly great. If you are a developer, you can install [**Code Medium**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-medium/dganoageikmadjocbmklfgaejpkdigbe){:target="_blank"}, a Chrome Extension that allows you to use Gist to paste beautiful code directly within Medium!

### Publication & Logo

I wrote about both life and technology, and to create a distinction, I established two publication channels: [**ZRealm Life\.**](https://medium.com/zrealm-life){:target="_blank"} **for sharing life and unboxing** / [**ZRealm Dev\.**](https://medium.com/zrealm-ios-dev){:target="_blank"} **for sharing work and technical articles**, allowing everyone to follow the content they are interested in.

A very **"Western-style"** item — **"LOGO"**. Should life have a sense of ritual? Since I’m running this, I should have my own brand identity. So, I asked a designer to help me create my logo concept. My design idea: the pentagon shape pays homage to my alma mater [National Taiwan University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntust.edu.tw/home.php){:target="_blank"}, with the pentagon representing tools and craftsmanship. The inner frame " **ZR** " actually hasn’t changed; it represents the first letter " **Z** " of my English name ZhongCheng and the " **R** " of Realm, my territory.

### Gains

Speaking of gains, let’s start with the original intention of writing — " **Teaching and Learning Together**." It’s not about showcasing anything, nor is it about making money; I haven’t put any articles behind a paywall because knowledge shouldn’t be something you have to pay for. Knowledge is power; **if you enjoy it, please consider supporting Medium by becoming a paid member** so we can have a more sustainable platform to use... (I’m genuinely worried it might suffer losses).

In terms of gains, aside from financial benefits, I’ve gained so much more. First is the **sense of achievement**; when people read my articles and respond, it gives me a great sense of accomplishment and motivates me to keep writing. Additionally, I’ve met many friends and fostered more exchanges. I tend to be a passive socializer, and before writing articles, I was quite unfamiliar with the community and had almost no interactions. Now, I’ve met many friends and feel **less lonely on the path of development! (Just like the subtitle of my publication — "You are not alone on the road to solving problems.")**

### Statistics

Since this is a review, it’s customary to share some statistics. 
In 2019 (including the end of 2018), I published a total of:
**25** articles: **2** lifestyle + **5** unboxing + **18** technical articles.
Accumulating about **60,000** views, **5,000** claps, and surpassing **200** followers!

#### The better-performing articles include:
1. [iOS Deferred Deep Link Implementation (Swift)](../b08ef940c196/)
2. [AirPods 2 Unboxing and Hands-On Experience](../33afa0ae557d/)
3. [How to Create an Engaging Engineering CTF Competition](../729d7b6817a4/)
4. [APP Uses HTTPS for Transmission, Yet Data Still Gets Stolen.](../46410aaada00/)
5. [Apple Watch Series 4 Comprehensive Experience from Purchase to Use](../a2920e33e73e/)

> Thank you all for your support and care! I will continue to work hard this year!

> Your follows and feedback are my motivation for writing!
