### Medium One Year Review

A review of one year of managing Medium, or a summary of 2019


In the blink of an eye, it has been a year since I published articles on Medium. The actual anniversary should be 2019/10 (the first article was in 2018/10); however, I was too busy at that time and lacked inspiration. As time moves forward into 2020, I hurriedly record my insights from a year of management, also serving as a summary of 2019!
### Review

First, I would like to thank [Enther Wu](https://medium.com/u/f211da1977d0){:target="_blank"} and [Chih\-Hung Yeh](https://medium.com/u/baaffcc5aecc){:target="_blank"} for their encouragement, which reignited my passion for writing. Initially, my articles were more like personal diaries or notes from work, with somewhat hollow content. However, I shamelessly shared them on social media. Looking back at my early articles now, I feel a bit embarrassed, not knowing what I was writing about, and the content had low value.

However, everything is part of the growth process. The more I write, the more skilled I become. As I document my thoughts, the scope of my research expands. Because I fear misleading others, missing important points, or misunderstanding things, writing articles has become not just a record but a deep exploration of certain issues. More importantly, it has led to my own growth and learning, and consequently, the quality of the content I share with everyone has improved significantly.

The community has been incredibly supportive. At first, I was really afraid of being criticized and losing confidence when I published my articles. But that didn't happen; the feedback I received was very positive. Even if the content of the articles wasn't necessarily helpful, this positive encouragement gave me more confidence in my creativity, allowing me to invest more time in documenting. Thank you all for your encouragement!

The writing experience on Medium is truly excellent. If you are also a software developer, you can install [**Code Medium**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-medium/dganoageikmadjocbmklfgaejpkdigbe){:target="_blank"} Chrome Extension, which allows you to use Gist to paste beautiful code directly within Medium!
### Publication & Logo

I wrote about life and technology, and to create a distinction, I fortunately established two Publication channels: [**ZRealm Life\.**](https://medium.com/zrealm-life){:target="_blank"} **sharing life and unboxing** / [**ZRealm Dev\.**](https://medium.com/zrealm-ios-dev){:target="_blank"} **sharing work and technical articles**, allowing everyone to follow the content they are interested in.

A very **"Western-style"** thing — **"LOGO"**. Should life have a sense of ritual? Since it's about management, there should be a brand identity of my own. So, I asked a designer to help me create my logo concept. My design concept: the pentagon shape pays homage to my alma mater [National Taiwan University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntust.edu.tw/home.php){:target="_blank"}, with the pentagon representing tools and craftsmanship. The inner frame " **ZR** " actually signifies the initials of my English name ZhongCheng, with " **Z**" and "R" representing **Realm**, my territory.
### Gains

Speaking of gains, let's first discuss the original intention of writing — " **Teaching and Learning Together**." It is not for showcasing anything, nor for making money; I have not put any paywalls on my articles. Knowledge should not be something that requires payment to access; knowledge is power. **If you like it, please support Medium's paid membership**, so we can have a more sustainable platform to use... (I am really afraid it won't survive losses.)

In terms of gains, aside from financial benefits, I have received plenty in other areas. The first is **a sense of achievement**; when people read my articles and respond, it gives me a great sense of accomplishment and motivates me to continue writing. Additionally, I have met many friends and fostered more exchanges. I am a passive socializer, and before writing articles, I was quite unfamiliar with the community, having almost no interactions. Now, I have met many friends and feel **not alone on the path of development! (Just like the subtitle of my Publication — "You are not alone on the road to solving problems.")**
### Statistics

Since this is a retrospective, it's customary to summarize some data.  
In 2019 (including the end of 2018), a total of:  
**25** articles were published: **2** lifestyle + **5** unboxings + **18** technical articles.  
Accumulated approximately **60,000** views, **5,000** claps, and surpassed **200** followers!  
#### The better-performing articles include:  
1. [iOS Deferred Deep Link Implementation (Swift)](../b08ef940c196/)  
2. [AirPods 2 Unboxing and Hands-on Experience](../33afa0ae557d/)  
3. [How to Create an Engaging Engineering CTF Competition](../729d7b6817a4/)  
4. [APP Uses HTTPS for Transmission, but Data Still Got Stolen.](../46410aaada00/)  
5. [Apple Watch Series 4 Comprehensive Experience from Purchase to Use](../a2920e33e73e/)  

> Thank you all for your support and care; I will continue to work hard this year!  

> Your follows and feedback are my motivation for writing!
