### Medium One-Year Review

A recap of my one-year journey on Medium, or a summary of 2019

It’s hard to believe that it has already been a year since I started publishing articles on Medium. Technically, my anniversary should be in October 2019 \(the first article was in October 2018\); however, I was too busy and lacked inspiration at that time. As we move into 2020, I want to quickly jot down my reflections from this past year, serving as a summary for 2019!

### Reflection

First, I want to thank [Enther Wu](https://medium.com/u/f211da1977d0){:target="_blank"} and [Chih\-Hung Yeh](https://medium.com/u/baaffcc5aecc){:target="_blank"} for encouraging me to reignite my passion for writing. Initially, my articles were more like personal diaries or notes from work, and the content felt quite empty. However, I shamelessly shared them on social media. Looking back at those early articles now, I feel a bit embarrassed; I’m not sure what I was writing about, and the content wasn’t very valuable.

But everything is part of the growth process. The more I wrote, the more comfortable I became, and my areas of research expanded. Because I was worried about misleading others, missing important points, or misunderstanding concepts, writing became not just a record but a deep exploration of certain issues. More importantly, it contributed to my personal growth. Consequently, the quality of what I shared with everyone improved significantly.

The community has been incredibly supportive. At first, I was really afraid of being criticized and losing confidence when I published my work. But that didn’t happen; the feedback I received was overwhelmingly positive. Even if the content of my articles wasn’t always helpful, this encouragement boosted my confidence in creating and led me to invest more time in documenting my thoughts. Thank you all for your support!

The writing experience on Medium is truly excellent. If you’re a developer, you can install [**Code Medium**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-medium/dganoageikmadjocbmklfgaejpkdigbe){:target="_blank"}, a Chrome Extension that allows you to use Gist to paste beautiful code directly within Medium!

### Publication & Logo

I wrote about both life and technology, and to create a distinction, I established two publication channels: [**ZRealm Life\.**](https://medium.com/zrealm-life){:target="_blank"} **for sharing life and unboxing** / [**ZRealm Dev\.**](https://medium.com/zrealm-ios-dev){:target="_blank"} **for sharing work and technical articles**, allowing everyone to follow the content they are interested in.

A very **“Western-style”** thing — **the "LOGO"**. Should life have a sense of ritual? Since I’m running this, I should have my own brand identity. So, I asked a designer to help me create my logo concept. My design idea: the pentagon shape pays homage to my alma mater’s [National Taiwan University of Science and Technology emblem](https://www.ntust.edu.tw/home.php){:target="_blank"}; the pentagon represents tools and craftsmanship. The inner frame “**ZR**” actually hasn’t changed; it stands for the first letter “**Z**” of my English name ZhongCheng and the “**R**” for Realm, my territory.

### Gains

Speaking of gains, let’s start with the original intention of writing — “**teaching and learning**.” It’s not about showcasing anything, nor is it about making money; I haven’t put any articles behind a paywall because knowledge shouldn’t require payment to access. Knowledge is power. **If you enjoy it, please consider supporting Medium by becoming a paid member** so we can have a more sustainable platform to use… \(I’m genuinely worried it might suffer losses\).

In terms of gains, aside from financial benefits, I’ve received a wealth of other rewards. First is the **sense of achievement**; when people read my articles and respond, it gives me a great sense of accomplishment and motivates me to keep writing. Additionally, I’ve met many friends and fostered more interactions. I tend to be a passive socializer, and before writing, I was quite unfamiliar with the community, having almost no interactions. Now, I’ve made many friends and feel **less lonely on the development journey! \(Just like the subtitle of my publication — “You are not alone on the road to solving problems.”\)**

### Statistics

Since this is a review, it’s customary to share some statistics. 
In 2019 \(including the end of 2018\), I published a total of:
**25** articles: **2** on life + **5** unboxing + **18** technical articles.
Accumulating about **60,000** views, **5,000** claps, and surpassing **200** followers!

#### The better-performing articles include:
1. [iOS Deferred Deep Link Implementation \(Swift\)](../b08ef940c196/)
2. [AirPods 2 Unboxing and Hands-On Experience](../33afa0ae557d/)
3. [How to Create an Engaging Engineering CTF Competition](../729d7b6817a4/)
4. [Apps Use HTTPS for Transmission, Yet Data Still Gets Stolen.](../46410aaada00/)
5. [Apple Watch Series 4 Comprehensive Experience from Purchase to Use](../a2920e33e73e/)

> Thank you all for your support and care; I will continue to work hard this year!

> Your follows and feedback are my motivation for writing!
