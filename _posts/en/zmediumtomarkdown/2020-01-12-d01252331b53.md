### One-Year Review of Managing Medium

A Detailed Review of Running Medium for One Year or a 2019 Summary

In the blink of an eye, it has been a year since publishing articles on Medium. The actual anniversary should have been October 2019 (the first post was in October 2018); but I was too busy and lacked inspiration then. Now, as time moves forward into 2020, I’m quickly recording my insights from a year of writing, also as a summary of 2019!

### Review

First, I want to thank [Enther Wu](https://medium.com/u/f211da1977d0){:target="_blank"} and [Chih-Hung Yeh](https://medium.com/u/baaffcc5aecc){:target="_blank"} for inspiring me and reigniting my passion for writing. My early articles were more like personal daily or work notes and were quite shallow. However, I shamelessly shared them on social media. Looking back now, those initial posts seem a bit awkward and lack valuable content.

However, it is all part of the growth process. The more I write, the more skilled I become. The scope of my research expands as I document. Fearing to mislead others, overlook details, or misunderstand, the pressure turns writing into not just recording but a deep exploration of a topic. This results in greater personal growth and, correspondingly, a significant improvement in the quality of content shared with everyone.

The community is truly kind-hearted. At first, I was afraid of being criticized and losing confidence when posting; but that didn’t happen. The feedback from everyone has been very positive. Even if the content isn’t always helpful, this positive encouragement has boosted my confidence in creating and motivated me to spend more time documenting. Thank you all for the support!

Medium offers a great writing experience. If you are a developer, you can install [**Code Medium**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-medium/dganoageikmadjocbmklfgaejpkdigbe){:target="_blank"}, a Chrome extension that lets you paste beautiful code using Gist directly within Medium!

### Publication & Logo

Wrote about life and technology, and fortunately created two Publication channels for distinction: [**ZRealm Life.**](https://medium.com/zrealm-life){:target="_blank"} **shares life and unboxings** / [**ZRealm Dev.**](https://medium.com/zrealm-ios-dev){:target="_blank"} **shares work and technical articles**,  
so everyone can follow based on the content they want to see.

A very **"Western-style"** thing — **"LOGO"**. Should life have a sense of ritual? Since it's about management, there should be a personal brand identity, right?  
So, I asked a designer to help create my logo concept; my design idea: the outer pentagon shape pays tribute to my alma mater [NTUST's emblem](https://www.ntust.edu.tw/home.php){:target="_blank"}. The five sides represent a wrench symbolizing technical craftsmanship. The inner frame "**ZR**" actually means unchanged, representing the first letter "**Z**" of my English-translated Chinese name ZhongCheng, and the "**R**" from Realm, my territory.

### Gains

To talk about gains, let's start with the original intention of writing — "**Teaching benefits both teacher and student**." It's not to show off or make money; none of my articles have paywalls because knowledge shouldn't require payment to access. Knowledge is power. **If you like it, please consider supporting Medium's paid membership** so we can sustain the platform longer… (I'm really worried it might not survive losses).

If I were to talk about gains, aside from financial benefits, I have gained a lot in other areas. First is the **sense of achievement**; having readers and feedback gives me a strong sense of accomplishment and motivates me to keep writing. Next is meeting many friends and having more interactions. I am a passive social person, and before writing articles, I was very unfamiliar with social communities and had almost no interaction. Now, having met many friends, I feel **I am no longer alone on the path of development! (Just like the subtitle of my Publication — "You are not alone on the road to solving problems")**.

### Statistics

Since this is a review, it's customary to include some statistics.  
In 2019 (including the end of 2018), a total of:  
**25** articles were published: **2** lifestyle + **5** unboxing + **18** technical articles  
Accumulated about **60,000** views, **5,000** claps, and surpassed **200** followers!

#### Articles with Better Performance Include:

1. [iOS Deferred Deep Link Implementation (Swift)](../b08ef940c196/)

2. [AirPods 2 Unboxing and First Impressions](../33afa0ae557d/)

3. [How to Create an Engaging Engineering CTF Competition](../729d7b6817a4/)

4. [The app uses HTTPS for transmission, but data was still stolen.](../46410aaada00/)

5. [Apple Watch Series 4 Complete Experience from Purchase to Use](../a2920e33e73e/)

> Thank you all for your support and love. I will continue to work hard this year!

> Your tracking and feedback are the driving force behind my writing!
