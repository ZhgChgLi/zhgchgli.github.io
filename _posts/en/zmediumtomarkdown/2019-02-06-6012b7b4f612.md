### iOS tintAdjustmentMode Property

The issue of the .tintColor setting becoming ineffective for Image Assets (Render as template) when presenting UIAlertController on this page

### Comparison Before and After Fix

No need for lengthy explanations, let's go straight to the comparison image.

Left Before Fix / Right After Fix

You can see that the icon on the left has its tintColor setting ineffective when presenting UIAlertController, and after the presented window is closed, the color setting returns to normal display.
#### Problem Fix

First, let’s introduce the **tintAdjustmentMode** property setting, which controls the display mode of **tintColor**. This property has three enumerations that can be set:
1. **\.Automatic**: The view's **tintAdjustmentMode** is consistent with the enclosing parent view's setting.
2. **\.Normal**: **Default mode**, displays the set **tintColor** normally.
3. **\.Dimmed**: Changes the **tintColor** to a low saturation, muted color (essentially gray!).

#### _The above issue is not a bug but rather a mechanism of the system itself:_

> _When presenting UIAlertController, the **tintAdjustmentMode** of the view on the Root ViewController of this page is changed to **Dimmed** (so technically, it’s not that the color setting is "ineffective," but rather that the **tintAdjustmentMode** mode has changed)_

However, sometimes we want the icon color to remain consistent, so we just need to keep the tintAdjustmentMode setting consistent in the tintColorDidChange event of UIView:
```swift
extension UIButton { 
   override func tintColorDidChange() {
        self.tintAdjustmentMode = .normal // Always keep it normal
    }
}
```

extension example
#### Conclusion!

It's not a big issue; it doesn't matter if you don't change it, but it is a bit annoying.

In fact, every page that encounters presenting UIAlertController, action sheets, popovers… will change the tintAdjustmentMode of the page's view to gray, but I only realized this on this page.

After searching for a while, I found that it was related to this property, and setting it resolved my small confusion.
