### iOS tintAdjustmentMode Property

Present UIAlertController Causes Image Assets (Render as Template) .tintColor Setting to Fail on Current Page

### Comparison Before and After Issue Fix

No fuss, just go straight to the comparison chart.

Left: Before correction / Right: After correction

You can see that the tintColor setting for the left icon fails when presenting a UIAlertController. However, the color setting returns to normal after the presented view is dismissed.

#### Issue Fixes

First, let's introduce the **tintAdjustmentMode** property. This property controls the display mode of **tintColor** and has three enum options:

1. **.Automatic**: The view's **tintAdjustmentMode** follows the setting of its enclosing parent view

2. **.Normal**: **Default mode**, displays the assigned **tintColor** normally

3. **.Dimmed**: Changes **tintColor** to a low-saturation, dim color (which is gray!)

#### *The above issue is not a bug but rather the inherent mechanism of the system:*

> *When presenting a UIAlertController, the **tintAdjustmentMode** of the Root ViewController's view on the current page changes to **Dimmed** (so technically, the color setting is not "disabled," but the **tintAdjustmentMode** is altered)*

Sometimes, if we want the ICON color to remain consistent, we only need to keep the tintAdjustmentMode the same in the UIView's tintColorDidChange event:

```swift
extension UIButton { 
   override func tintColorDidChange() {
        self.tintAdjustmentMode = .normal // Always keep normal
    }
}
```

extension example

#### The End!

It's not a big issue, and it's fine if not changed, but it is just annoying to look at.

Actually, every page that presents a UIAlertController, action sheet, or popover will change the view's tintAdjustmentMode to gray, but I only noticed it on this page.

I searched for a while and found that it is related to this property. After setting it, my small doubt was resolved.
