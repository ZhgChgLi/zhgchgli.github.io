#### Introduction

In the previous article, "[**CI/CD Practical Guide (Part 1): What is CI/CD? How to Build a Stable and Efficient Development Team with CI/CD? Tool Selection?**](../c008a9e8ceca/)", we introduced what CI/CD is, the benefits it brings, and how to choose tools. **This article will focus on the architecture and usage of GitHub Actions and Self-hosted Runners**, and we will build several interesting automation workflows together to help you get started.
### GitHub Actions Architecture Flowchart

Before we begin, let's clarify the operational architecture and responsibilities of GitHub Actions.


![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*iacfyTX_b3YTSzMcn2ldjw.png)

#### **GitHub Repo**
- In the world of GitHub Actions, all Actions (Workflow YAML files) must be stored in a Git Repo ( `REPO/.github/workflows/` )

#### GitHub Repo — Actions Secrets

Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets.
- Stores Secret Keys and Tokens used in Actions steps
e.g. Slack Bot Token, Apple Store Connect API .p8 Key
- **The contents of Secrets cannot be viewed in Action Logs and will be automatically obscured with \* \* \* \***
- Secrets cannot be viewed or edited, only overwritten
- Secrets **currently only support plain text content and cannot upload files** 
**\-** If you have binary keys, please refer to the [official steps to store them after converting with Base64 encoding](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#storing-base64-binary-blobs-as-secrets){:target="_blank"}.
\- For storing iOS development certificates, refer to the official tutorial: [Installing an Apple certificate on macOS runners for Xcode development](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/use-cases-and-examples/deploying/installing-an-apple-certificate-on-macos-runners-for-xcode-development){:target="_blank"}
- Organization-level Secrets can be stored and shared across Repos

#### GitHub Repo — Actions Variables

Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables.
- Stores commonly used variables in Actions steps
e.g. Simulator iOS version, working directory
- Variable contents can be viewed and edited
- Variable contents can be output in Action Logs
- Variables only support plain text, but you can store JSON strings and parse them for use
- Organization-level Variables can be stored and shared across Repos

#### GitHub Actions — Trigger
- **The most important starting point in GitHub Actions — Trigger Events (Conditions)**
- Only GitHub Actions that meet the trigger events will be executed
- A complete list of events can be [found in the official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows){:target="_blank"}
- It basically covers all CI/CD and automation event scenarios.
However, **if there are special scenarios without events, you can only use other events + conditions in Jobs or use Schedule to manually check**.
e.g. If there is no PR Merged event, you can only achieve it with `pull_request: closed` + Job `if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true`.


**Commonly Used Events:**
- `schedule` (cron): Scheduled execution (like crontab)
Can be used for automation: regularly checking PRs, regularly packaging, regularly executing automation scripts
**All executed in main / develop (Default Branch).**
- `pull_request:` PR-related events
Triggered when a PR is opened, assigned, labeled, or has a new push commit, etc.
- `issues`, `issue_comment`: Issue-related events
Triggered when an Issue is opened or has a new comment, etc.
- `workflow_dispatch`: Manually triggered; you can set required fields, and GitHub Actions provides a simple form for users to fill in information.
e.g.:



![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*XogIJsCbrNPerWBto_PG8w.png)

- `workflow_call`: Triggers another Action (Workflow) to execute tasks.
- `workflow_run`: Executes this task when another Action (Workflow) runs.


> _For more event types and configuration details, please [refer to the official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows){:target="_blank"}._ 




#### **GitHub Actions — Workflow**
- Also known as Action
- Written in YAML, .yaml files are uniformly placed under `REPO/.github/workflows/`
- **The Workflow YAML files in the main branch take precedence** 
If you cannot see the Action being developed in other branches or if there are execution errors, you can try merging back to the main branch.
- The most basic unit in GitHub Actions, each Workflow represents a CI/CD or automation operation
- Workflows can call other Workflows to execute tasks
(You can use this feature to separate core Workflows from called Workflows)
- It defines task names, execution strategies, trigger events, task work, and all Action-related settings
- Currently, the file structure does not support subdirectories
- Actions are completely free (Public and Private Repos)

#### GitHub Actions — Workflow — Job
- The execution unit in GitHub Actions
- Defines what tasks are included in the Workflow
- Each Workflow can have multiple Jobs
- Each Job needs to specify which Runner Label to use, and the corresponding Runner machine will execute the task
- **Multiple Jobs are executed concurrently** (if there is an order, you can use `needs` to constrain)
- **Each Job should be treated as an independent execution entity (each should be considered a Sandbox)**, if a Job ends and produces resource files for subsequent Jobs/Workflows, you need to Upload Artifacts or move them to a shared output directory on self-hosted.
- After a Job is completed, it can output strings for other Jobs to reference.
(e.g. execution result true or false)
- Unless special process conditions are set, if one of multiple Jobs encounters an error, **the other Jobs will still continue to execute**

#### GitHub Actions — Reuse Workflow/Job
- Workflows defined with `on: workflow_call` can be encapsulated for reuse as Jobs in other Workflows
- Can be shared across Repos within the same organization
- Therefore, CI/CD tasks that need to be shared across Repos can be placed in a shared Repo for use

#### GitHub Actions — Workflow — Job — Step
- The smallest execution unit in GitHub Actions
- The program that actually executes tasks in a Job
- Each Job can have multiple Steps
- **Multiple Steps are executed in order**
- After a Step is completed, it can output strings for subsequent Steps to reference.
- **Steps can directly write shell script programs** 
You can reference [gh cli](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh){:target="_blank"}, current environment variables (e.g. to get PR numbers), and directly perform the desired actions
- Unless special process conditions are set, if a Step encounters an error, **it will directly interrupt**, and subsequent Steps will not execute

#### GitHub Actions — Workflow — Job — Reuse Action Step
- **You can directly reuse existing work steps packaged by various experts on the [Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions){:target="_blank"}.** 
For example: [Comment content to PR](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/comment-pull-request){:target="_blank"}.
- You can also package a series of task Steps into an Action GitHub Repo for others to reuse directly
- Actions from Public Repos can be listed on the Marketplace


**Packaging Actions supports:**
- **Docker Action** — Indicates that GitHub Actions will pass environment variables to the Docker container, and you can handle them as you wish, whether it's shell script, Java, PHP, etc.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript Action** — Directly uses node.js to write the logic for GitHub Actions, and the environment variables will also be passed for your reference.
e.g. [pozil/auto-assign-issue](https://github.com/pozil/auto-assign-issue/blob/v2/action.yml){:target="_blank"}
- **Composite (YAML)** — Pure YAML describing task steps (same as GitHub Actions — Workflow — Job — Step) can declare which steps to perform or directly write shell scripts on it.
e.g. [ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender/blob/main/action.yml){:target="_blank"}



> _Due to space constraints, this article will not cover how to package GitHub Actions. For those interested, please refer to the official documentation: [tutorials/creating-a-composite-action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/tutorials/creating-a-composite-action){:target="_blank"}._ 




#### GitHub Runner
- GitHub dispatches corresponding Jobs to Runners based on Runner Labels
- Runners only act as listeners, polling to listen for tasks dispatched by GitHub
- They only care about Jobs, not which Action (Workflow) it is
Thus, it may happen that Job-1 of Action A finishes, and the next one is Job-1 of Action B, rather than waiting for all Jobs of Action A to finish before switching to Action B.
- Runners can use GitHub Hosted Runners or Self-hosted Runners.

#### **GitHub Hosted Runner**
- Runners provided by GitHub, you can refer to the official Repo list:

![[Images list from June 2025](https://github.com/actions/runner-images){:target="_blank"}](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*KtQV4kDCWscEeaZ8jQI8Dg.png)

[Images list from June 2025](https://github.com/actions/runner-images){:target="_blank"}
- You can click to see what is pre-installed on the Runner:
e.g. [macos-14-arm64](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/macos/macos-14-arm64-Readme.md){:target="_blank"}



![[macos-14-arm64](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/macos/macos-14-arm64-Readme.md){:target="_blank"}](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*svXtXH78-TvK1C_XXCyYLA.png)

[macos-14-arm64](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/macos/macos-14-arm64-Readme.md){:target="_blank"}
- For iOS development, it is recommended to use the -arm64 (M series) processor Runners for faster performance
- Just paste the YAML Label from the table into Job `run-on`, and you can use that Runner to execute tasks
- **Public Repo pricing: Completely free unlimited use**
- **️** Private Repo free tier:
Free tier (varies by account, for GitHub Free as an example):
Usage: 2,000 free minutes per month
Storage: 500 MB
- **⚠️️Private Repo billing method:** 
**Billing starts after exceeding the free tier (you can set limits and notifications), and the price varies depending on the operating system and core of the Runner's machine:**



![[about-billing-for-github-actions](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/about-billing-for-github-actions){:target="_blank"}](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*rkhRJN4ZRas_lDOJh-pjkQ.png)

[about-billing-for-github-actions](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/about-billing-for-github-actions){:target="_blank"}

You can see that the price for macOS is high due to the high equipment costs.
- Maximum concurrent task limits:



![[usage-limits-billing-and-administration](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/overview/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#usage-limits){:target="_blank"}](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*LU3zGSBe57NBVMfDwl0wdQ.png)

[usage-limits-billing-and-administration](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/overview/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#usage-limits){:target="_blank"}


> _We have digressed too much; our focus is on Self-hosted Runners._ 




#### Self-hosted Runner on In-house Server
- Use your own machine as a Runner
- **A physical machine can run multiple Runners concurrently to accept tasks**
- **Free unlimited use** 
Only the cost of purchasing the machine, use it indefinitely after a one-time investment!
For example, with a 32G RAM M4 Mini (≈NT$40,900), if using GitHub Hosted Runners would cost 500 USD per month; **buying one and setting it up would pay off in just over three months!**
- Supports Windows, macOS, Linux (x64/ARM/ARM64)
- **Runners can be shared across Repos within the same organization**
- **⚠️Currently: actions/cache, actions/upload-artifact, actions/download-artifact only support GitHub cloud services, meaning these contents will still be uploaded to GitHub servers and counted towards storage fees.** 
You can set up a shared directory on your own machine instead.
- Self-hosted Runners also support [Docker, k8s](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/runners/about-actions-runner-controller){:target="_blank"}, but I haven't researched that.


> **_Setting up a Self-hosted Runner only requires a few steps (set up within 10 minutes) to start accepting tasks (this article will introduce it later)._** 




#### GitHub Workflow x Job x Step x Runner Relationship Diagram


![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*WHIVfXdVRoEsdXGfJhu2Rw.png)


This diagram summarizes the workflow and relationships, assuming we have two Workflows and two Runners:
- CI — Assume R has 3 Jobs, each Job has several Steps, Runner Label (run-on) — `self-hosted-app`
- CD — Has 4 Jobs, each Job has several Steps, Runner Label (run-on) — `self-hosted-app`
- Runners — There are 2, both with Runner Label — `self-hosted-app`


As mentioned earlier, Runners and Workflows are dispatched and received based on Runner Labels. In this case, all use the same `self-hosted-app` Runner Label. The Jobs in the Workflow are executed concurrently by default, while the Steps are the actual execution content of each Job, executed serially in order. Once all Steps are completed, it means the Job has finished executing.


> **_Therefore, the actual execution timeline of the Workflow will shuttle between the two Runners executing Jobs, and they will execute concurrently. The next Job executed may not necessarily be the next Job in the same Workflow._** 





> _⚠️ This is why it is important to ensure that each Job is independent (especially in a Self-hosted Runner environment, where the output of one Job may not be cleaned up properly after it ends, leading us to subconsciously think that the output of this Job can be used by the next Job). This should not be the case._ 




#### If a Job produces output for subsequent Jobs to use:
- **Job Output String**: Outputs plain text to variables for other Jobs to reference
- **Artifact-upload/download:** The last step of a Job uploads the execution result to GitHub Artifact, and the first step of another Job downloads it for further processing.
e.g. For example, Job — Packaging → Upload the packaging result .ipa to **Artifact →** Job — Deployment → Download the .ipa → Upload to App Store for deployment
Note: **Currently, even if it is Self-hosted, it will still go to GitHub Artifact cloud storage.**
- **AWS/GCP… Cloud Storage**: Same as above, but using your own cloud storage service.
- **\[Self-hosted Only\] Shared Hard Drive, Directory:** If Self-hosted Runners are all mounted to a shared directory, you can create folders based on UUID to store output results, and subsequent Jobs can read the previous Job Output UUID to find the corresponding storage and retrieve it for use.
Note: Runners on different machines must also mount the same shared directory.
- Complete all tasks within the same Job's Steps.

### Learning by Doing GitHub Actions — Case Implementation

"Actions speak louder than words." The definitions and process structure mentioned above may have left everyone a bit confused. Next, I will directly present three functional examples, guiding you through hands-on practice while explaining the concepts encountered along the way, learning GitHub Actions through doing.

### Case — 1

Automatically label File Changes Size after creating a Pull Request to help the Reviewer arrange their review tasks.
#### Result Image

![[Demo PR](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/pull/11){:target="_blank"}](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*vjSWeu2zB-hmVpfziMDR5Q.png)

[Demo PR](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/pull/11){:target="_blank"}
#### Workflow
- User opens PR, reopens PR, or pushes a new commit to PR
- Triggers GitHub Actions Workflow
- Shell script retrieves the number of file changes
- Determines the count and labels the PR accordingly
- Done

#### Hands-On

Repo → Actions → New workflow → set up a workflow yourself.

**File Name:** `Automation-PullRequest.yml`

Action Workflows can have each task in a separate file or aggregate tasks with the same purpose in the same file based on triggering events. Since multiple jobs run concurrently, **GitHub Actions currently does not support directory structures, so having fewer files and using hierarchical naming will make management easier**.

Here, all actions related to PR events are placed in the same workflow.
#### `Automation-PullRequest.yml`
```yaml
# Workflow(Action) Name
name: Pull Request Automation

# Actions Log Title
run-name: "[Pull Request Automation] ${{ github.event.pull_request.title || github.ref }}"

# Trigger Events
on:
  # PR Events
  pull_request:
    # PR - Opened, Reopened, New Push Commit
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

# If there is a new job in the same concurrency group, it will cancel the running one
# For example, if a task triggered by a push commit has not executed yet and another push commit occurs, the previous task will be canceled
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref_name }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

# Job Items
# Jobs will run concurrently
jobs:
  # Job ID
  label-pr-by-file-count:
    # Job Name (optional, better for readability in logs)
    name: Label PR by changes file count

    # If this job fails, it does not affect the entire workflow; other jobs continue
    continue-on-error: true
    
    # Set maximum timeout to prevent endless waiting in case of exceptions
    timeout-minutes: 10

    # Runner Label - Use GitHub Hosted Runner ubuntu-latest to execute the job
    # If it's a private repo, usage will be calculated, and exceeding limits may incur costs
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Job Steps
    # Steps will execute in order
    steps:
      # Step Name
      - name: Get changed file count and apply label
        # Step ID (optional, not needed if no subsequent step references output)
        id: get-changed-files-count-by-gh
        # Inject external environment variables into the runtime
        env:
          # secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN is a token automatically generated during GitHub Actions execution, no need to set it in Secrets, it has some GitHub Repo API Scopes permissions
          # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/use-github_token-in-workflows
          # gh (GitHub) CLI needs to inject GH_TOKEN into ENV for permission to operate  
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        # Shell script
        # GitHub Hosted Runner has gh CLI pre-installed, no need to install it in the job
        run: |
          #   ${{ github.xxx }} is a GitHub Actions Context expression
          #   It is not a shell variable, but is replaced by GitHub Actions with the corresponding value during the YAML parsing phase
          #   Other parameters: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context
          
          # Get PR number:
          PR_NUMBER=${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}

          # Get Repo:
          REPO=${{ github.repository }}

          # Use GitHub API (gh CLI) to get the number of changed files
          FILE_COUNT=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --repo $REPO --json files --jq '.files | length')
          
          # Print Log
          echo "Changed file count: $FILE_COUNT"

          # Label logic
          if [ "$FILE_COUNT" -lt 5 ]; then
            LABEL="XS"
          elif [ "$FILE_COUNT" -lt 10 ]; then
            LABEL="S"
          elif [ "$FILE_COUNT" -lt 30 ]; then
            LABEL="M"
          elif [ "$FILE_COUNT" -lt 80 ]; then
            LABEL="L"
          elif [ "$FILE_COUNT" -lt 200 ]; then
            LABEL="XL"
          else
            LABEL="XXL"
          fi

          # Use GitHub API (gh CLI) to remove the current Size Label
          EXISTING_LABELS=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --repo "$REPO" --json labels --jq '.labels[].name')
          for EXISTING in $EXISTING_LABELS; do
            case "$EXISTING" in
              XS|S|M|L|XL|XXL)
                echo "🧹 Removing existing label: $EXISTING"
                gh pr edit "$PR_NUMBER" --repo "$REPO" --remove-label "$EXISTING"
                ;;
            esac
          done

          # (Optional) Create the label if it does not exist
          if ! gh label list --repo "$REPO" | grep -q "^$LABEL"; then
            echo "🆕 Creating missing label: $LABEL"
            gh label create "$LABEL" --repo "$REPO" --description "Size label: $LABEL" --color "ededed"
          else
            echo "✅ Label '$LABEL' already exists"
          fi
          
          # Use GitHub API (gh CLI) to label the PR
          gh pr edit $PR_NUMBER --repo $REPO --add-label "$LABEL"
```

After committing the file to the main branch of the repo, opening a new PR will automatically trigger GitHub Actions:

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*wdAztL0BgPeSZdqXxqUEXg.png)

The Action execution status shows **Queued**, indicating that the task is waiting for the Runner to take over.

#### Execution Result

![[Demo PR](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/pull/11){:target="_blank"}](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*-JoD8IQYHVrDqHmLmrXyaQ.png)

[Demo PR](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/pull/11){:target="_blank"}

Once completed successfully, the PR will automatically be labeled with the corresponding label! The record will show that it was labeled by `github-actions`.

**Complete Code: [Automation\-PullRequest\.yml](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/Automation-PullRequest.yml){:target="_blank"}**
#### Directly Use Pre-packaged Action Steps: [pascalgn/size\-label\-action](https://github.com/pascalgn/size-label-action/tree/main){:target="_blank"}

As mentioned earlier, you can directly use pre-packaged Actions. The task of labeling PR Size has an existing solution available; the above example is for educational purposes, and you don't need to reinvent the wheel.

You can simply use it directly in the Action Workflow Job Step:
```yaml
# Workflow(Action) Name
name: Pull Request Automation

# Trigger Events
on:
  # PR Events
  pull_request:
    # PR - Opened, Reopened, New Push Commit
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

# If there is a new job in the same concurrency group, it will cancel the running one
# For example, if a task triggered by a push commit has not executed yet and another push commit occurs, the previous task will be canceled
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref_name }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

# Job Items
# Jobs will run concurrently
jobs:
  # Job ID
  label-pr-by-file-count:
    # Job Name (optional, better for readability in logs)
    name: Label PR by changes file count

    # If this job fails, it does not affect the entire workflow; other jobs continue
    continue-on-error: true
    
    # Set maximum timeout to prevent endless waiting in case of exceptions
    timeout-minutes: 10

    # Runner Label - Use GitHub Hosted Runner ubuntu-latest to execute the job
    # If it's a private repo, usage will be calculated, and exceeding limits may incur costs
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Job Steps
    # Steps will execute in order
    steps:
      # Step Name
      - name: Get changed file count and apply label
        # Step ID (optional, not needed if no subsequent step references output)
        id: get-changed-files-count-by-gh
        # Directly use pre-packaged program
        uses: "pascalgn/size-label-action@v0.5.5"
        # Inject external environment variables into the runtime
        # Parameter naming and available parameters should refer to the documentation: https://github.com/pascalgn/size-label-action/tree/main
        env:
          # secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN is a token automatically generated during GitHub Actions execution (github-actions identity), no need to set it in Secrets, it has some GitHub Repo API Scopes permissions
          # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/use-github_token-in-workflows
          GITHUB_TOKEN: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
```

This pre-packaged Action is a JavaScript Action, and you can refer to the actual execution code in the following file: [dist/index\.js](https://github.com/pascalgn/size-label-action/blob/main/dist/index.js){:target="_blank"}.
#### Supplement on name and run\-name:

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*zBmjm_3AU53NN0UhTrmOBQ.png)

- name: Name of the Action Workflow
- run\-name: Title of the execution log (can include PR Title or Branch or Author…etc)
If it is an on:pull_request event, the default is the PR Title.

### Case — 2

Automatically assign the author to themselves and comment if there is no Assignee after creating a Pull Request. (This only executes on the initial creation.)
#### Result Image

![[Demo PR](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/pull/11){:target="_blank"}](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*EL-0nQF7jhP34d6ZoSkJAg.png)

[Demo PR](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/pull/11){:target="_blank"}
#### Workflow
- User opens PR
- Triggers GitHub Actions Workflow
- GitHub script retrieves assignees
- If there are no assignees, it assigns the author of the PR & comments the message
- Done

#### Hands-On

Repo → Actions → New workflow → set up a workflow yourself.

**File Name:** `Automation-PullRequest.yml` (same as above)
#### `Automation-PullRequest.yml`
```yaml
# Workflow(Action) Name
name: Pull Request Automation

# Actions Log Title
run-name: "Pull Request Automation - Daily Checker"

# Trigger Events
on:
  # PR Events
  pull_request:
    # PR - Opened, Reopened, New Push Commit
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

# If there is a new job in the same concurrency group, it will cancel the running one
# For example, if a task triggered by a push commit has not executed yet and another push commit occurs, the previous task will be canceled
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref_name }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

# Job Items
# Jobs will run concurrently
jobs:
  # Job ID
  label-pr-by-file-count:
    # Please refer to the previous section, omitted....
  # ---------
  assign-self-if-no-assignee:
    name: Automatically assign to self if no assignee is specified
    # Since this is a shared trigger event, the job itself determines when to execute; it only runs when the Pull Request is opened (initial creation)
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action == 'opened'

    # If this job fails, it does not affect the entire workflow; other jobs continue
    continue-on-error: true
    
    # Set maximum timeout to prevent endless waiting in case of exceptions
    timeout-minutes: 10
    
    # Runner Label - Use GitHub Hosted Runner ubuntu-latest to execute the job
    # If it's a private repo, usage will be calculated, and exceeding limits may incur costs
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Assign self if No Assignee
        # Use GitHub Script (JavaScript) to write the script (Node.js environment)
        # Compared to writing directly in Shell Script, this is more convenient and elegant
        # No need to inject environment variables or GITHUB_TOKEN
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            // In github-script, context variables are automatically injected for direct reference in JavaScript
            // https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context

            const issue = context.payload.pull_request; // If you want to support issues as well, you can write it as context.payload.issue || context.payload.pull_request
            const assignees = issue.assignees || [];
            const me = context.actor;

            if (assignees.length === 0) {
              // Set Assignee to self
              await github.rest.issues.addAssignees({
                owner: context.repo.owner,
                repo: context.repo.repo,
                issue_number: issue.number,
                assignees: [me]
              });

              // Leave a comment to notify
              await github.rest.issues.createComment({
                owner: context.repo.owner,
                repo: context.repo.repo,
                issue_number: issue.number,
                body: `🔧 No assignee was set, so I have assigned this to myself (@${me}).`
              });
            }
```

This time we demonstrate using GitHub Script (JavaScript) to write the script, which offers more flexibility and better syntax.

Of course, if you want to follow my previous suggestion of having each task in a separate file, you can remove the Job If condition and directly set the Action Workflow trigger condition:

`Automation-PullRequest-Auto-Assign.yml` **:**
```yaml
# Workflow(Action) Name
name: Pull Request Automation - Auto Assignee Self

# Trigger Events
on:
  # PR Events
  pull_request:
    # PR - On opening
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  assign-self-if-no-assignee:
    name: Automatically assign to self if no assignee is specified
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Please refer to the previous section, omitted....
```

After committing the file to the main branch of the repo, opening a new PR will automatically trigger GitHub Actions:

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*Y-A6owUibNEFBoRFHnqIYg.png)

Now there are two jobs to execute!
#### Execution Result

![[Demo PR](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/pull/11){:target="_blank"}](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*23muCVgUJKmZt746khBMFQ.png)

[Demo PR](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/pull/11){:target="_blank"}

Once completed successfully, if the PR has no assignees, it will automatically assign the PR author and comment the message. (All actions are performed under the `github-actions` identity)

**Complete Code: [Automation\-PullRequest\.yml](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/Automation-PullRequest.yml){:target="_blank"}**
#### Test Reopening PR

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*mcDa7TZjv6mO7HtwhOE-Vw.png)

You can see that only the Size Label Job will execute, while the Auto Assignee Job was skipped.

> _This task also has a pre-packaged Action available for reuse; you can refer to: [pozil/auto\-assign\-issue](https://github.com/pozil/auto-assign-issue){:target="_blank"}._

### Case — 3

Automatically count the current number of PRs and how long they have been open every morning at 9 AM, sending notification messages to the Slack workgroup, and automatically closing PRs that have been open for more than 3 months.
#### Result Image
```

```markdown
![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*0stX9KpZi6PcXpG-90wyIg.png)

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*Nbg3r1zzhx24YIBEjPJnaw.png)

- Slack workgroup automatically receives reports every morning
- Automatically closes PRs that have been open for more than 90 days

#### Workflow
- GitHub Actions is triggered automatically every morning at 9 AM
- Triggers the GitHub Actions Workflow
- GitHub script retrieves the list of open PRs and counts how many days they have been open
- Sends the statistical report message to Slack
- Closes PRs that have been open for more than 90 days
- Done

            console.log(`Closed ${oldPRs.length} PR(s)`);
```

In this example, we use:
- on: schedule Crontab to automatically trigger and workflow\_dispatch to support manual triggering
- Job output/Step output (both can only be strings)
- Multiple Jobs are concurrent by default but can use `needs` for time dependency
- Retrieve settings from Repo Secrets/Variables
- Connect to Slack API

**Repo Secrets — Add** `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*YC4DBHtKmX5XGgcSSzaE5A.png)

- For creating a Slack App and setting message permissions, you can refer to my [previous article](../bd94cc88f9c9/)

**Repo Variables — Add** `SLACK_TEAM_CHANNEL_ID`

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*X4gZ5_IRvsiehAL0O9AleQ.png)

After committing the file to the main branch of the Repo, return to Actions and manually trigger it:

> _It will automatically trigger daily in the future._

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*WNFKXl-QC2WGyaSWep5-DA.png)

Actions → Pull Request Automation — Daily Checker → Run workflow → Branch: main → Run workflow.

**After execution, you can click to view the execution status:**

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*4mvOxnd1uS4ZlxnNoNdHaQ.png)

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*BluzFgY2tM2E7DwoVq1jQw.png)

Due to the `needs` constraint, the Jobs process will be that `Calculate PR Status` completes first, then `Auto Close Old PRs` and `Send PR Summary Message to Slack` will execute concurrently.
#### Execution Result

**After all tasks are successfully executed, you can check the Slack message:**

### Summary

> I hope the three examples above give you a preliminary understanding of GitHub Actions and inspire your automation work ideas. You can come up with your own workflows (please be sure to refer to [trigger events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows){:target="_blank"}), and then write scripts to execute; also remember to check the [**Marketplace**](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions){:target="_blank"} for existing steps that you can use directly.

This article is just an introduction (even without checking out code). The next article, "[**CI/CD Practical Guide (3): Implementing CI and CD Workflows for App Projects Using GitHub Actions**](../4b001d2e8440/)," will introduce more complex and in-depth GitHub Actions Workflows.
#### GitHub Automation Extension Topics

GitHub can integrate with Slack to subscribe to Repo PR update notifications, Push Default Branch notifications, etc.

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*BMTT4koRBIIsQ7_mklC86w.png)

**Question 1. GitHub messages cannot tag people, only tags GitHub accounts, and Slack accounts do not receive notifications:**

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*Ddp0cEtXE10hScM1rozmtg.png)

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*uHGJ7l__AdYoWT9KpvihLQ.png)

[Slack App](https://slack.github.com/){:target="_blank"} or search for GitHub in Apps → open the message window → complete the **Connect GitHub Account** step, so GitHub knows what your corresponding Slack UID is and can tag you.

**Question 2. Pull Request Reminder**

I remember this was originally a feature developed by a third party, but it was later integrated directly into GitHub. Don't foolishly write scripts using GitHub Actions for this!

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*BpMd2K0NBDE6xB1XzFY94Q.png)

> [**_GitHub has a built-in setting by Team, you need to first add a Team for the organization, add the Repo to the Team, and then you can set up Pull Request Reminders._**](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/managing-scheduled-reminders-for-your-team){:target="_blank"}

- After entering the Slack Channel and rules, it will automatically send reminder messages and tag Reviewers every day. You can refer to the setup [here](https://michaelheap.com/github-scheduled-reminders/){:target="_blank"}, and the result is shown in the image below:

![[https://michaelheap\.com/github\-scheduled\-reminders/](https://michaelheap.com/github-scheduled-reminders/){:target="_blank"}](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*kvqFXkIKIxP79Wm8vIaN0Q.png)

[https://michaelheap\.com/github\-scheduled\-reminders/](https://michaelheap.com/github-scheduled-reminders/){:target="_blank"}

**Question 4. GitHub PR messages, authors do not receive notifications:**

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*wmtXwXAcQZDXqInRd0ivPw.png)

> _This is a long-standing issue, where the PR Slack message **actually the author does not know that someone has replied in the threads for discussion**. The Slack message sent by GitHub only tags Reviewers, not Assignees or PR authors._

At this point, GitHub Actions can be used to create an automation tool. We can add a Job to append the author tag at the end of the PR Description, so that when the message is sent to Slack, it will also tag the author’s Slack:
```bash
# Workflow(Action) name
name: Pull Request Automation
# Please refer to the previous text, omitted....

  # ---------
  append-author-to-pr-description:
    name: Append author to PR description
    # Since this is a shared trigger event, the Job will determine itself, and only execute when the Pull Request is Opened (first created), otherwise it will be Skipped
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action == 'opened'
    
    # If this Job fails, it does not affect the entire Workflow, continue with other Jobs
    continue-on-error: true
    
    # Set the maximum Timeout duration to prevent endless waiting in case of exceptions
    timeout-minutes: 10
    
    # Runner Label - uses GitHub Hosted Runner ubuntu-latest to execute the job
    # If it's a Private Repo, usage will be calculated, and exceeding may incur costs
    # But this kind of automation task is not likely to exceed usage
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Append author to PR description
        env:
          # secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN is a Token automatically generated during GitHub Actions execution, no need to set it in Secrets, it has some GitHub Repo API Scopes permissions
          # gh (GitHub) CLI needs to inject GH_TOKEN into ENV for permission to operate
          # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/use-github_token-in-workflows
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

          #   ${{ github.xxx }} is a GitHub Actions Context expression
          #   It is not a Shell variable, but is replaced by GitHub Actions during the YAML parsing phase with the corresponding value
          #   Other parameters: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context
          PR_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          AUTHOR_TAG: '@${{ github.event.pull_request.user.login }}'
        run: |
          PR_BODY=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --repo ${{ github.repository }} --json body -q ".body")
          NEW_BODY=$(printf "%s\n\nCreated by %s" "$PR_BODY" "$AUTHOR_TAG")
          gh pr edit $PR_NUMBER --repo ${{ github.repository }} --body "$NEW_BODY"
```

**Full Code: [Automation\-PullRequest\.yml](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/Automation-PullRequest.yml){:target="_blank"}**

When opening a PR, it will automatically append the author information at the end of the description, and the Slack message will correctly tag the author:

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*MjVsFqE--xAq1zSQfCNVdQ.png)

**Question 5. GitHub sends too many notification emails, which is very disruptive:**

After setting up GitHub Repo notifications and Slack, you can go to your GitHub personal settings to turn off email notifications:

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*INgfO9B2bNFy-Nd1ZjnzOw.png)

#### Others

Actions currently do not have a directory structure, but you can pin (Pin) five Actions at the top of the Actions page; you can also use Disable to pause a specific Action.

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*ZD-5xkparhJqtnm2REeu6A.png)

You can check GitHub Actions usage and execution performance in Insights:

### GitHub Actions Script Syntax Supplement

To clarify some variables that you might find confusing, such as `${{ XXX }}`, `${XXX}`, or `$XXX`.

**Demo\-Env\-Vars\- \.yml:**
```yaml
name: Demo-Env-Vars

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  print-env-vars:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

```yaml
steps:
  - name: print-env
    run: env
  - name: context-vars-vs-vars
    env:
      SAY_MY_NAME: "Heisenberg"
      # GitHub Actions Context expressions, explained below
      FROM_REF: "${{ github.ref }}"
    run: |
      # Shell Script:
      # Referencing custom injected ENV variable content
      # ${SAY_MY_NAME} or $SAY_MY_NAME both work
      # ${XX} is more useful for string concatenation:
      echo "HI: ${SAY_MY_NAME}"
      
      # 💡 GitHub Actions Context expressions
      # This is not a shell variable, but a value replaced by GitHub Actions during the YAML parsing phase
      # ⚠ This will fail if executed in a local or non-GitHub Actions environment
      # 🔗 https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context
      BRANCH_NAME_FROM_CONTEXT="${{ github.ref }}"
      
      # 💡 Environment variables during GitHub Actions execution
      # These variables are automatically injected by GitHub Actions when the runner executes the shell
      # ✅ In other environments, you can use export or ENV to predefine the same variables
      # 🔗 https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables
      BRANCH_NAME_FROM_ENV_VARS="${GITHUB_REF}"
      
      echo "FROM_REF: ${FROM_REF}"

#### $\{ \{ XXX \} \} GitHub Actions Context Expressions

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*e3jpPuwdmf005cjbaXjAwQ.png)

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*ed5Wm7Xk48xuP8yQzHpJ9w.png)

- `${{ XXX }}` is a GitHub Actions Context expression, **which is replaced by GitHub Actions with the corresponding value during the YAML parsing phase** (as shown in the image `BRANCH_NAME_FROM_CONTEXT`)
- For a complete list of usable expressions, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context){:target="_blank"}
- `${XXX}` or `$XXX` are actual environment variables, with `${XXX}` being more useful for string concatenation
- GitHub Actions automatically injects some environment variables; for a complete list, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables){:target="_blank"}

#### actions/github\-script@v7

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*TjJQnlAAU3VRwS9_dFz1yA.png)

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*5bHEdjrGsVdWnYSQgpnsZA.png)

- In `github-script`, you can also use `${{ XXX }}` as a GitHub Actions Context expression, but it is not very meaningful; because **context variables are automatically injected in the github-script environment for direct reference in JavaScript**
- In `github-script`, the `github` object is an instance of the Octokit REST API
- `github-script` can also inject variables from `env:`, but you need to access them using `${process.env.xxx}`
- Some environment variables are also automatically injected; for a complete list, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables){:target="_blank"} Access them using `${process.env.xxx}`; however, since there are already `context` variables, accessing them from here is not very meaningful

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*oW85Sju0sN4caXiaLSg32A.png)

- `github-script` automatically includes `github-token`, no need to specify it

#### gh cli GH\_TOKEN

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*NUfaaKIobZWVBuXrGg0TPw.png)

- When using `gh cli` in GitHub Actions Shell Script, you need to specify the `GH_TOKEN` parameter
- You can directly use the default Token — `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatically generated during GitHub Actions execution)
- **The default Token has some basic permissions; if the command you want to execute does not have enough permissions, you will need to use a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/use-github_token-in-workflows){:target="_blank"}. It is recommended to create a PAT using a shared account for team use.**

GitHub Actions has been developed, and the next step is to replace the GitHub Hosted Runner with our own Self-hosted Runner.

> _GitHub Hosted Runner has a free quota of 2,000 minutes per month (starting), running such small automation tasks does not take much time, and since it runs on Linux machines, the cost is very low, you may not even reach the free limit; **there is no need to switch to a Self-hosted Runner**. Changing the Runner also requires ensuring the Runner environment is correct (for example, GitHub Hosted Runner comes with gh cli, while self-hosted Runner needs to have it installed). **This article purely discusses this switch for educational purposes.**_

> _If used for executing CI/CD tasks, then a Self-hosted Runner is necessary._ 

#### Adding a Self-hosted Runner

> _This article uses **macOS M1** as an example._

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*mEInaj-tLaprMAa2OfowCw.png)

- Settings → Actions → Runners → New self-hosted runner.
- **Runner image:** macOS
- **Architecture**: For M1, remember to select ARM64 for faster execution

**Open a Terminal on your physical computer.**

**Follow the Download steps to complete on your local computer:**
```bash
# Create a Runner directory at your desired path
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
# Download the Runner image
curl -o actions-runner-osx-x64-2.325.0.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.325.0/actions-runner-osx-x64-2.325.0.tar.gz

# Optional: Validate the hash
echo "0562bd934b27ca0c6d8a357df00809fbc7b4d5524d4aeb6ec152e14fd520a4c3  actions-runner-osx-x64-2.325.0.tar.gz" | shasum -a 256 -c

# Unzip
tar xzf ./actions-runner-osx-x64-2.325.0.tar.gz
```

> _The above is just a reference; it is recommended to follow the steps on your settings page to ensure you have the latest version of the Runner image._

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*Q0k0EPjrY2V4owseESe5lg.png)

**Configure Settings:**
```bash
# Please refer to the commands on the settings page; the Token will change over time
./config.sh --url https://github.com/ORG/REPO --token XXX
```

You will be prompted to enter:
- Enter the name of the runner group to add this runner to: \[press Enter for Default\] **Just press Enter**
*Only runners registered at the Organization level have the Group feature
- Enter the name of runner: \[press Enter for ZhgChgLideMacBook\-Pro\] **You can enter the desired Runner name e.g.** `app-runner-1` **or just press Enter**
- This runner will have the following labels: ‘self-hosted’, ‘macOS’, ‘X64’
Enter any additional labels \(e.g. label\-1,label\-2\): \[press Enter to skip\] 
**Enter the desired Runner label; you can add custom labels for convenience later** 
As mentioned earlier, GitHub Actions/Runner finds tasks based on corresponding labels, **if you only use the default label, the Runner may pick up other Runners in the organization to execute tasks, so it’s safest to customize one**. 
Here, I randomly set a label `self-hosted-zhgchgli`
- Enter name of work folder: \[press Enter for \_work\] **Just press Enter**

When you see √ Settings Saved, it means the configuration is complete.

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*yxLfii0rWhzsiFuYVmPgFw.png)

**Start the Runner:**
```bash
./run.sh
```

When you see √ Connected to GitHub, Listening for Jobs, it means it is now listening for Actions tasks:

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*1RmPPOosAoCxHA9tg_WE2w.png)

> **_This Terminal window must remain open to continuously receive tasks._** 

> **_🚀🚀🚀 You can open multiple Terminals on the same computer in different directories to run multiple Runners._** 

**Returning to the Repo settings page, you can also see the Runner waiting for tasks:**

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*jjq5NTPYMuC3gH3ey_VTtg.png)

**Status:**
- Idle: Waiting for tasks
- Active: A task is currently being executed
- Offline: Runner is not online

#### Workflow (GitHub Actions) Runner Changed to Self-hosted Runner

Using `Automation-PullRequest.yml` as an example:
```yaml
# Please refer to the previous text, omitted....
jobs:
  label-pr-by-file-count:
    # Please refer to the previous text, omitted....
    runs-on: [self-hosted-zhgchgli]
    # Please refer to the previous text, omitted....
  # ---------
  assign-self-if-no-assignee:
    # Please refer to the previous text, omitted....
    runs-on: [self-hosted-zhgchgli]

    steps:
      # Please refer to the previous text, omitted....
```

After committing the file to the main branch of the Repo, reopen the PR to trigger the Actions verification.

**Returning to the Runner Terminal, you can see that a new task has come in, currently executing and showing the execution results:**

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*Hu0DxKQbenPmBEw8swv65A.png)

It failed because my local computer does not have the [gh cli](https://github.com/cli/cli){:target="_blank"} environment installed:

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*9xguacdPATIeEZdbFszmHw.png)

After installing gh on the physical computer using `brew install gh`, trigger the execution again:

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*TbkAt00K89Ysbix33dK8ZA.png)

Success! Now this task is completely executed on our own computer, without using GitHub Hosted Runner, and without incurring costs.

**We can click into the Action Log to see which Runner and machine the task was executed on:**

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*oqLcWfn6cbWsCt9fVsrikQ.png)

#### runs\-on: \[ **Runner Label\] Setting

Here it is AND, not OR; GitHub Runner does not currently support OR selection of Runners for execution.

For example: `[self-hosted, macOS, app]` → means the Runner must **have all** `self-hosted, macOS, app` three Labels to match and take on tasks for execution.

If a Job wants to test results under different Runner environments simultaneously, you can use the `matrix` parameter:
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.runner }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        runner:
          - [self-hosted, linux, high-memory]
          - [self-hosted, macos, xcode-15]

    steps:
      - run: echo "Running on ${{ matrix.runner }}"
```

This way, this Job will execute once in parallel on the following two Runner Labels:
- self\-hosted, linux, high\-memory
- self\-hosted, macos, xcode\-15

> **_Runners currently do not support:_** 

> _\- OR selection of Runners_ 

> _\- Runner weight settings_ 

#### Registering Runner as a Service

You can refer to the official documentation on "[Configuring the self-hosted runner application as a service](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/configuring-the-self-hosted-runner-application-as-a-service?platform=mac){:target="_blank"}" to register the Runner directly as a system Service, allowing it to run in the background (without needing to keep the Terminal open) and automatically start after boot.

If you have multiple Runners, remember to adjust the "[Customizing the self-hosted runner service](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/configuring-the-self-hosted-runner-application-as-a-service?platform=mac#customizing-the-self-hosted-runner-service-1){:target="_blank"}" settings to register with different names.

> _I have a pending issue to research regarding iOS, **which is that after switching to background Service, I encountered errors during Archive (suspected to be related to keychain permissions)**. I didn't have time to resolve it, so I continued using the foreground Terminal Runner._ 

If you want to achieve automatic startup on boot for a traditional foreground setup, you need to add an auto-start configuration file in `~/Library/LaunchAgents`:

`actions.runner.REPO.RUNNER_NAME.plist` :
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
 <dict>
  <key>Label</key>
  <string>actions.runner.REPO.RUNNER_NAME</string>
  <!-- Specify Terminal.app to start -->
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
   <string>/usr/bin/open</string>
   <string>-a</string>
   <string>Terminal</string>
   <string>/Users/zhgchgli/Documents/actions-runner/run.sh</string>
  </array>
  <key>RunAtLoad</key>
  <true/>
  <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
  <string>/Users/zhgchgli/Documents/actions-runner</string>
 </dict>
</plist>
```
