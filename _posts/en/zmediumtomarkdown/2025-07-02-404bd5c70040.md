#### Introduction

In the previous article, "[**CI/CD Practical Guide (Part 1): What is CI/CD? How to Build a Stable and Efficient Development Team with CI/CD? Tool Selection?**](../c008a9e8ceca/)", we introduced what CI/CD is, the benefits it brings, and how to choose tools. **This article will focus on the architecture and usage of GitHub Actions and Self-hosted Runners**, and we will build several interesting automation workflows together to help you get started.

### GitHub Actions Architecture Flowchart

Before we begin, let's clarify the operational architecture and responsibilities of GitHub Actions.

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*iacfyTX_b3YTSzMcn2ldjw.png)

#### **GitHub Repo**
- In the world of GitHub Actions, all Actions (Workflow YAML files) must be stored in a Git Repo ( `REPO/.github/workflows/` )

#### GitHub Repo — Actions Secrets

Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets.
- Stores Secret Keys and Tokens used in Actions steps
e.g. Slack Bot Token, Apple Store Connect API .p8 Key
- **Secrets cannot be viewed in Action Logs and will be automatically hidden with \* \* \* \***
- Secrets cannot be viewed or edited, only overwritten
- Secrets **currently only support plain text content and cannot upload files** 
**\-** For binary secrets, please refer to the [official steps to store them after Base64 encoding](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#storing-base64-binary-blobs-as-secrets){:target="_blank"}.
\- For iOS development certificate storage methods, refer to the official tutorial: [Installing an Apple certificate on macOS runners for Xcode development](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/use-cases-and-examples/deploying/installing-an-apple-certificate-on-macos-runners-for-xcode-development){:target="_blank"}
- Organization-level Secrets can be stored and shared across Repos.

#### GitHub Repo — Actions Variables

Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables.
- Stores commonly used variables in Actions steps
e.g. Simulator iOS version, working directory
- Variables can be viewed and edited
- Variables can be output in Action Logs
- Variables only support plain text but can also store JSON strings for parsing
- Organization-level Variables can be stored and shared across Repos.

#### GitHub Actions — Trigger
- **The most important starting point in GitHub Actions — Trigger Events (Conditions)**
- Only GitHub Actions that meet the trigger events will be executed
- A complete list of events can be [found in the official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows){:target="_blank"}
- It basically covers all CI/CD and automation event scenarios.
However, **if there are special scenarios without events, you can only use other events + conditions in Jobs or use Schedule to manually check**.
e.g. If there is no PR Merged event, you can only use `pull_request: closed` + Job `if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true` to achieve this.

**Commonly Used Events:**
- `schedule` (cron): Scheduled execution (like crontab)
Can be used for automation: regularly checking PRs, packaging, executing automation scripts
**All executed in main / develop (Default Branch).**
- `pull_request:`: PR related events
Triggered when a PR is opened, reopened, assigned, or has new Push Commits, etc.
- `issues`, `issue_comment`: Issue related events
Triggered when an Issue is opened or has new comments, etc.
- `workflow_dispatch`: Manually triggered; fields can be set for user input, and GitHub Actions provides a simple form for users to fill in information.
e.g.:

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*XogIJsCbrNPerWBto_PG8w.png)

- `workflow_call`: Triggers another Action (Workflow) to execute tasks.
- `workflow_run`: Triggered when another Action (Workflow) executes tasks.

> _For more event types and configuration details, please [refer to the official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows){:target="_blank"}._ 

#### **GitHub Actions — Workflow**
- Also known as Action
- Written in YAML format, with files stored under `REPO/.github/workflows/`
- **The Workflow YAML files in the main branch take precedence**
- The most basic unit in GitHub Actions, each Workflow represents a CI/CD or automation operation
- Workflows can call other Workflows to execute tasks
(You can use this feature to separate core Workflows and called Workflows)
- It defines task names, execution strategies, trigger events, task work, and all Action-related settings
- Currently, the file structure does not support subdirectories
- **Actions can be shared across Repos within the same organization, allowing for Action Workflow reuse**
- Actions are completely free (Public and Private Repos)

#### GitHub Actions — Workflow — Job
- The execution unit in GitHub Actions
- Defines what tasks are included in the Workflow
- Each Workflow can have multiple Jobs
- Each Job needs to specify which Runner Label to use, and the corresponding Runner machine will execute the task
- **Multiple Jobs are executed concurrently** (if there is an order, you can use `needs` to constrain them)
- **Each Job should be treated as an independent execution instance (each should be considered a Sandbox)**, and if there are output resource files to be used by subsequent Jobs/Workflows, they need to be uploaded as Artifacts or moved to a shared output directory on self-hosted.
- Jobs can output strings for reference by other Jobs.
(e.g. execution results true or false)

#### GitHub Actions — Workflow — Job — Step
- The smallest execution unit in GitHub Actions
- The actual program that executes tasks within a Job
- Each Job can have multiple Steps
- **Multiple Steps are executed in order**
- Steps can output strings for subsequent Steps to reference.
- **Steps can directly write shell script programs** 
You can reference [gh cli](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh){:target="_blank"}, current environment variables (e.g. to get PR numbers), and directly perform the desired actions.

#### GitHub Actions — Workflow — Job — Reuse Action Step
- **You can directly reuse existing steps packaged by various experts on the [Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions){:target="_blank"}** 
For example: [Comment content to PR](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/comment-pull-request){:target="_blank"}.
- You can also package a series of task Steps into an Action GitHub Repo for reuse in other workflows.
- Public Repo Actions can be listed on the Marketplace.

**Packaging Actions supports:**
- **Docker Action** — This means GitHub Actions will pass environment variables to the Docker container, and you can handle them as needed, whether with shell scripts, Java, PHP, etc.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript Action** — Directly written in node.js to handle GitHub Actions logic, and environment variables will also be passed for your reference.
e.g. [pozil/auto-assign-issue](https://github.com/pozil/auto-assign-issue/blob/v2/action.yml){:target="_blank"}
- **Composite (YAML)** — Pure YAML describing task steps (same as GitHub Actions — Workflow — Job — Step) can declare which steps to perform or directly write shell scripts on it.
e.g. [ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender/blob/main/action.yml){:target="_blank"}

> _Due to space constraints, this article will not cover how to package GitHub Actions. For those interested, please refer to the official documentation: [tutorials/creating-a-composite-action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/tutorials/creating-a-composite-action){:target="_blank"}._ 

#### GitHub Runner
- GitHub dispatches corresponding Jobs to Runners based on Runner Labels
- Runners only act as listeners, polling for tasks dispatched by GitHub
- They only care about Jobs, not which Action (Workflow) they belong to
Thus, you may see Job-1 from Action A execute, followed by Job-1 from Action B, rather than waiting for all Jobs from Action A to finish before switching to Action B.
- Runners can use GitHub Hosted Runners or Self-hosted Runners.

#### **GitHub Hosted Runner**
- Runners provided by GitHub, you can refer to the official Repo list:

[![](https://opengraph.githubassets.com/789814327f4ded4d09005b81f5aebafbe1af6674c5f60b2accfad53932502489/actions/runner-images)](https://github.com/actions/runner-images){:target="_blank"}

![[Image List for June 2025](https://github.com/actions/runner-images){:target="_blank"}](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*KtQV4kDCWscEeaZ8jQI8Dg.png)

[Image List for June 2025](https://github.com/actions/runner-images){:target="_blank"}
- You can check what is pre-installed on the Runners:
e.g. [macos-14-arm64](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/macos/macos-14-arm64-Readme.md){:target="_blank"}

![[macos-14-arm64](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/macos/macos-14-arm64-Readme.md){:target="_blank"}](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*svXtXH78-TvK1C_XXCyYLA.png)

[macos-14-arm64](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/macos/macos-14-arm64-Readme.md){:target="_blank"}
- For iOS development, it is recommended to use the -arm64 (M series) processor Runners for better performance.
- Just place the YAML Label from the table in the Job `run-on` to use that Runner for task execution.
- **Public Repo pricing: Completely free with unlimited usage**
- **️** Private Repo free tier:
Free tier (varies by account, for GitHub Free as an example):
Usage: 2,000 free minutes per month
Storage: 500 MB
- **⚠️️Private Repo billing method:** 
**After exceeding the free tier, usage will be billed (you can set limits and notifications), and prices vary depending on the operating system and core of the Runner:** 

![[about-billing-for-github-actions](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/about-billing-for-github-actions){:target="_blank"}](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*rkhRJN4ZRas_lDOJh-pjkQ.png)

[about-billing-for-github-actions](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/about-billing-for-github-actions){:target="_blank"}

You can see that the price for macOS is higher due to the high equipment costs.
- Maximum concurrent task limits:

![[usage-limits-billing-and-administration](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/overview/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#usage-limits){:target="_blank"}](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*LU3zGSBe57NBVMfDwl0wdQ.png)

[usage-limits-billing-and-administration](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/overview/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#usage-limits){:target="_blank"}

> _We've gone off on a tangent here; our focus is on Self-hosted Runners._ 

#### Self-hosted Runner on In-house Server
- Use your own machine as a Runner
- **A single physical machine can run multiple Runners concurrently to handle tasks**
- **Free unlimited usage** 
You only incur the cost of purchasing the machine, and you can use it indefinitely!
For example, with a 32G RAM M4 Mini (costing NT$40,900), if you use GitHub Hosted Runners, you would spend 500 USD in a month; **buying one and setting it up would pay off in just over three months!**
- Supports Windows, macOS, Linux (x64/ARM/ARM64)
- **Runners can be shared across Repos within the same organization**
- **⚠️Currently: actions/cache, actions/upload-artifact, actions/download-artifact only support GitHub cloud services, meaning these contents will still be uploaded to GitHub servers and counted towards storage fees.** You can set up shared directories on your own machine as a substitute.
- Self-hosted Runners also support [Docker, k8s](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/runners/about-actions-runner-controller){:target="_blank"}, though I haven't researched that.

> **_Setting up a Self-hosted Runner only takes a few steps (set up in under 10 minutes) to start receiving tasks for execution (this article will cover this later)._** 

### Learning by Doing GitHub Actions — Case Implementation

"Better to act than to talk." The definitions and structural introductions above may leave you a bit confused, so we will directly present three functional examples, guiding you to practice hands-on while explaining the concepts encountered, allowing you to learn about GitHub Actions through doing.

### Case — 1

Automatically label File Changes Size after creating a Pull Request to help the Reviewer arrange their review work.
#### Result Image

![[Demo PR](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/pull/11){:target="_blank"}](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*vjSWeu2zB-hmVpfziMDR5Q.png)

[Demo PR](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/pull/11){:target="_blank"}
#### Operation Flow
- User opens PR, reopens PR, or pushes new commits to PR
- Triggers GitHub Actions Workflow
- Shell script retrieves the number of file changes
- Determines the count and labels the PR accordingly
- Completed

#### Hands-on

Repo → Actions → New workflow → set up a workflow yourself.

**File Name:** `Automation-PullRequest.yml`

Action Workflows can be independent files for each task, or you can aggregate them in the same file based on trigger events and purposes. Since multiple Jobs are executed concurrently, **and because GitHub Actions currently does not support directory structures, having fewer files and using hierarchical naming will make management easier**.

Here, all PR-related Actions are placed in the same Workflow.
#### `Automation-PullRequest.yml`
```yaml
# Workflow (Action) name
name: Pull Request Automation

# Title name in Actions Log
run-name: "[Pull Request Automation] ${{ github.event.pull_request.title || github.ref }}"

# Trigger events
on:
  # PR events
  pull_request:
    # PR - opened, reopened, new Push Commit
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

# Jobs in the same Concurrency Group will cancel the running ones if new Jobs are triggered
# For example, if a task triggered by a Push Commit hasn't executed yet and another Push Commit occurs, the previous task will be canceled
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref_name }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

# Job tasks
# Jobs will execute concurrently
jobs:
  # Job ID
  label-pr-by-file-count:
    # Job name (optional, helps with readability in logs)
    name: Label PR by changes file count

    # If this Job fails, it does not affect the entire Workflow, and other Jobs will continue
    continue-on-error: true
    
    # Set a maximum timeout to prevent endless waiting in case of anomalies
    timeout-minutes: 10

    # Runner Label - use GitHub Hosted Runner ubuntu-latest to execute the task
    # If it's a Private Repo, usage will be counted, which may incur costs
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

```markdown
# Workflow Steps
# The workflow steps will be executed in order
steps:
  # Step Name
  - name: Get changed file count and apply label
    # Step ID (optional; if there are no subsequent steps that need to reference output, it doesn't need to be set)
    id: get-changed-files-count-by-gh
    # Inject external environment parameters into the execution environment
    env:
      # secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN is a token automatically generated during GitHub Actions execution; no need to set it in Secrets. It has certain GitHub Repo API Scopes permissions.
      # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/use-github_token-in-workflows
      # The gh (GitHub) CLI needs to inject GH_TOKEN into ENV for it to have permission to operate.
      GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    # Shell script
    # GitHub Hosted Runner has the gh CLI pre-installed, so it can be used directly without installation.
    run: |
      #   ${{ github.xxx }} is a GitHub Actions Context expression
      #   It is not a Shell variable; rather, it is replaced with the corresponding value during the YAML parsing phase by GitHub Actions.
      #   Other parameters: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context
      
      # Get PR number:
      PR_NUMBER=${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}

      # Get Repo:
      REPO=${{ github.repository }}

      # Use GitHub API (gh CLI) to get the number of changed files
      FILE_COUNT=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --repo $REPO --json files --jq '.files | length')
      
      # Print Log
      echo "Changed file count: $FILE_COUNT"

      # Label logic
      if [ "$FILE_COUNT" -lt 5 ]; then
        LABEL="XS"
      elif [ "$FILE_COUNT" -lt 10 ]; then
        LABEL="S"
      elif [ "$FILE_COUNT" -lt 30 ]; then
        LABEL="M"
      elif [ "$FILE_COUNT" -lt 80 ]; then
        LABEL="L"
      elif [ "$FILE_COUNT" -lt 200 ]; then
        LABEL="XL"
      else
        LABEL="XXL"
      fi

      # Use GitHub API (gh CLI) to remove existing Size Labels
      EXISTING_LABELS=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --repo "$REPO" --json labels --jq '.labels[].name')
      for EXISTING in $EXISTING_LABELS; do
        case "$EXISTING" in
          XS|S|M|L|XL|XXL)
            echo "🧹 Removing existing label: $EXISTING"
            gh pr edit "$PR_NUMBER" --repo "$REPO" --remove-label "$EXISTING"
            ;;
        esac
      done

      # (Optional) Create the label if it doesn't exist
      if ! gh label list --repo "$REPO" | grep -q "^$LABEL"; then
        echo "🆕 Creating missing label: $LABEL"
        gh label create "$LABEL" --repo "$REPO" --description "Size label: $LABEL" --color "ededed"
      else
        echo "✅ Label '$LABEL' already exists"
      fi
      
      # Use GitHub API (gh CLI) to add the label
      gh pr edit $PR_NUMBER --repo $REPO --add-label "$LABEL"
```

After committing the file to the main branch of the repo, we can open a new PR, which will automatically trigger GitHub Actions:

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*wdAztL0BgPeSZdqXxqUEXg.png)

The Action execution status shows **Queued**, indicating that the task is waiting for a Runner to take over.

#### Execution Result

![[Demo PR](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/pull/11){:target="_blank"}](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*-JoD8IQYHVrDqHmLmrXyaQ.png)

[Demo PR](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/pull/11){:target="_blank"}

Once the execution is completed successfully, the corresponding label will be automatically applied to the PR! The record will show that it was labeled by `github-actions`.

**Complete Code: [Automation\-PullRequest\.yml](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/Automation-PullRequest.yml){:target="_blank"}**

#### Directly Using Pre-packaged Action Steps: [pascalgn/size\-label\-action](https://github.com/pascalgn/size-label-action/tree/main){:target="_blank"}

As mentioned earlier, you can directly use pre-packaged Actions. The task of labeling PR Size Labels already has a ready-made solution available. The above example is just for educational purposes; you don't actually need to reinvent the wheel.

You can simply use it directly in the Action Workflow Job Step to complete the task:
```yaml
# Workflow (Action) Name
name: Pull Request Automation

# Trigger Events
on:
  # PR Events
  pull_request:
    # PR - When opened, reopened, or a new Push Commit occurs
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

# If there are new Jobs in the same Concurrency Group, the currently running ones will be canceled.
# For example, if a task triggered by a Push Commit hasn't executed yet and another Push Commit occurs, the previous task will be canceled.
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref_name }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

# Job Items
# Jobs will run concurrently
jobs:
  # Job ID
  label-pr-by-file-count:
    # Job Name (optional; having it set makes logs easier to read)
    name: Label PR by changes file count

    # If this Job fails, it won't affect the entire Workflow; other Jobs will continue.
    continue-on-error: true
    
    # Set the maximum Timeout duration to prevent endless waiting in case of anomalies.
    timeout-minutes: 10

    # Runner Label - Use GitHub Hosted Runner ubuntu-latest to execute the work.
    # If it's a Private Repo, usage will be calculated, and exceeding limits may incur costs.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Workflow Steps
    # Steps will be executed in order
    steps:
      # Step Name
      - name: Get changed file count and apply label
        # Step ID (optional; if there are no subsequent steps that need to reference output, it doesn't need to be set)
        id: get-changed-files-count-by-gh
        # Directly use someone else's packaged program
        uses: "pascalgn/size-label-action@v0.5.5"
        # Inject external environment parameters into the execution environment
        # Parameter naming and available parameters should refer to the documentation: https://github.com/pascalgn/size-label-action/tree/main
        env:
          # secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN is a token automatically generated during GitHub Actions execution (as the identity of github-actions); no need to set it in Secrets. It has certain GitHub Repo API Scopes permissions.
          # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/use-github_token-in-workflows
          GITHUB_TOKEN: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
```

[![](https://opengraph.githubassets.com/12cd04cddb9059ef9771b22b12a412e3655d2555b037268cdb3ece55f3d0cd18/pascalgn/size-label-action)](https://github.com/pascalgn/size-label-action/tree/main){:target="_blank"}

This packaged Action is a JavaScript Action, and you can refer to the actual execution code in the following file: [dist/index\.js](https://github.com/pascalgn/size-label-action/blob/main/dist/index.js){:target="_blank"}.

#### Supplement on name and run\-name:

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*zBmjm_3AU53NN0UhTrmOBQ.png)

- name: The name of the Action Workflow
- run\-name: The title name of the execution record (can include PR Title or Branch or Author…etc)
If it's an on:pull_request event, the default is the PR Title.

### Case Study — 2

After creating a Pull Request, if there is no Assignee, automatically assign the author to themselves and comment with a prompt. (This will only execute when the PR is first created.)
#### Result Image

![[Demo PR](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/pull/11){:target="_blank"}](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*EL-0nQF7jhP34d6ZoSkJAg.png)

[Demo PR](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/pull/11){:target="_blank"}

#### Workflow Process
- User opens a PR
- Triggers GitHub Actions Workflow
- GitHub script retrieves assignees
- If there are no assignees, it assigns the author of the PR & comments with a message
- Completed

#### Let's Do It

Repo → Actions → New workflow → set up a workflow yourself.

**File Name:** `Automation-PullRequest.yml` (same as above)
#### `Automation-PullRequest.yml`
```yaml
# Workflow (Action) Name
name: Pull Request Automation

# Title name for Actions Log
run-name: "Pull Request Automation - Daily Checker"

# Trigger Events
on:
  # PR Events
  pull_request:
    # PR - When opened, reopened, or a new Push Commit occurs
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

# If there are new Jobs in the same Concurrency Group, the currently running ones will be canceled.
# For example, if a task triggered by a Push Commit hasn't executed yet and another Push Commit occurs, the previous task will be canceled.

    # Please refer to the previous text, omitted....
  # ---------
  assign-self-if-no-assignee:
    name: Automatically assign to self if no assignee is specified
    # Since this is a shared trigger event, we determine in the Job itself that it should only execute when the Pull Request is opened (first created), otherwise it will be skipped.
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action == 'opened'

    # If this Job fails, it won't affect the entire Workflow; other Jobs will continue.
    continue-on-error: true
    
    # Set the maximum Timeout duration to prevent endless waiting in case of anomalies.
    timeout-minutes: 10
    
    # Runner Label - Use GitHub Hosted Runner ubuntu-latest to execute the work.
    # If it's a Private Repo, usage will be calculated, and exceeding limits may incur costs.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Assign self if No Assignee
        # Use GitHub Script (JavaScript) to write the script (Node.js environment)
        # Compared to writing in Shell Script, this is more convenient and cleaner.
        # It also doesn't require injecting environment variables or GITHUB_TOKEN.
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            // In github-script, context variables are automatically injected for direct reference in JavaScript.
            // https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context

            const issue = context.payload.pull_request; // If you want to support Issues as well, you can write it as context.payload.issue || context.payload.pull_request
            const assignees = issue.assignees || [];
            const me = context.actor;

            if (assignees.length === 0) {

              await github.rest.issues.addAssignees({
                owner: context.repo.owner,
                repo: context.repo.repo,
                issue_number: issue.number,
                assignees: [me]
              });

              // Leave a comment notification
              await github.rest.issues.createComment({
                owner: context.repo.owner,
                repo: context.repo.repo,
                issue_number: issue.number,
                body: `🔧 No assignee was set, so I have assigned this to myself (@${me}).`
              });
            }
```

This time, we demonstrate using GitHub Script (JavaScript) to write the script, which offers more flexibility and better syntax.

Of course, if you want to follow my previous suggestion of having each task in a separate file, you can remove the Job If condition and directly set the Action Workflow trigger conditions:

`Automation-PullRequest-Auto-Assign.yml` **:**
```yaml
# Workflow (Action) Name
name: Pull Request Automation - Auto Assignee Self

# Trigger Events
on:
  # PR Events
  pull_request:
    # PR - When opened
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  assign-self-if-no-assignee:
    name: Automatically assign to self if no assignee is specified
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Please refer to the previous text, omitted....
```

After committing the file to the main branch of the repo, we can open a new PR, which will automatically trigger GitHub Actions:

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*Y-A6owUibNEFBoRFHnqIYg.png)

Now there are two Jobs to execute!
#### Execution Result

![[Demo PR](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/pull/11){:target="_blank"}](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*23muCVgUJKmZt746khBMFQ.png)

[Demo PR](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/pull/11){:target="_blank"}

Once the execution is completed successfully, if the PR has no Assignees, it will automatically assign the PR author and comment with a message. (All actions are performed under the identity of `github-actions`.)

**Complete Code: [Automation\-PullRequest\.yml](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/Automation-PullRequest.yml){:target="_blank"}**

#### Testing Reopened PR

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*mcDa7TZjv6mO7HtwhOE-Vw.png)

You can see that only the Size Label Job will execute, while the Auto Assignee Job was skipped.

> _This task also has a pre-packaged Action available for direct reuse; you can refer to: [pozil/auto\-assign\-issue](https://github.com/pozil/auto-assign-issue){:target="_blank"}._

### Case Study — 3

Automatically send a notification message to the Slack workgroup every day at 9 AM, summarizing the current number of PRs and how long they have been open, and automatically close PRs that have been open for more than 3 months.
#### Result Image

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*0stX9KpZi6PcXpG-90wyIg.png)

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*Nbg3r1zzhx24YIBEjPJnaw.png)

- The Slack workgroup receives a report automatically every morning.
- Automatically closes PRs that have been open for more than 90 days.

#### Workflow Process
- GitHub Actions automatically triggers every day at 9 AM.
- Triggers GitHub Actions Workflow.
- GitHub script retrieves the list of open PRs and counts how many days they have been open.
- Sends the statistical report message to Slack.
- Closes PRs that have been open for more than 90 days.
- Completed.

            });
          }
          console.log(`Closed ${oldPRs.length} PR(s)`);
```

In this example, we use:
- on: schedule Crontab to automatically trigger and workflow_dispatch to support manual triggering
- Job output/Step output (both can only be strings)
- Multiple Jobs default to concurrent execution but can use `needs` for time dependency
- Retrieve settings from Repo Secrets/Variables
- Integrate with Slack API

**Repo Secrets — Add** `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*YC4DBHtKmX5XGgcSSzaE5A.png)

- For creating a Slack App and setting message permissions, you can refer to my [previous article](../bd94cc88f9c9/)

**Repo Variables — Add** `SLACK_TEAM_CHANNEL_ID`

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*X4gZ5_IRvsiehAL0O9AleQ.png)

After committing the file to the main branch of the Repo, return to Actions and manually trigger it:

> _It will automatically trigger daily in the future._

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*WNFKXl-QC2WGyaSWep5-DA.png)

Actions → Pull Request Automation — Daily Checker → Run workflow → Branch: main → Run workflow.

**After execution, you can click to view the execution status:**

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*BluzFgY2tM2E7DwoVq1jQw.png)

Due to the `needs` constraint, the Jobs process will complete `Calculate PR Status` first before concurrently executing `Auto Close Old PRs` and `Send PR Summary Message to Slack`.
#### Execution Results

**After all tasks are successfully executed, you can check the Slack message:**

### Summary

> I hope the three examples above give you a preliminary understanding of GitHub Actions and inspire your automation work ideas. You can come up with your own workflows (please be sure to refer to [trigger events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows){:target="_blank"}), and then write scripts to execute; also remember to check the [**Marketplace**](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions){:target="_blank"} for existing steps that you can use directly.

This article is just an introduction (even without checking out code), and the next article, "[**CI/CD Practical Guide (Part 3): Implementing CI and CD Workflows for App Projects Using GitHub Actions**](../4b001d2e8440/)" will introduce more complex and in-depth GitHub Actions Workflows.
#### GitHub Automation Extension Topics

GitHub can integrate with Slack to subscribe to Repo PR update notifications, Push Default Branch notifications, etc.

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*BMTT4koRBIIsQ7_mklC86w.png)

**Question 1. GitHub messages cannot tag people, only GitHub accounts are tagged, and Slack accounts do not receive notifications:**

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*Ddp0cEtXE10hScM1rozmtg.png)

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*uHGJ7l__AdYoWT9KpvihLQ.png)

[Slack App](https://slack.github.com/){:target="_blank"} or search for GitHub in Apps → Open the message window → complete the **Connect GitHub Account** step, so that GitHub knows what your corresponding Slack UID is and can tag you.

**Question 2. Pull Request Reminder**

I remember this was originally a feature developed by a third party, but it was later integrated directly into GitHub. Don't foolishly write scripts using GitHub Actions for this!

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*BpMd2K0NBDE6xB1XzFY94Q.png)

> [**_GitHub has a built-in setting by Team; you need to first add a Team for the organization, add the Repo to the Team, and then you can set up Pull Request Reminders._**](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/managing-scheduled-reminders-for-your-team){:target="_blank"}

- After entering the Slack Channel and rules, it will automatically send reminder messages and tag Reviewers every day. You can refer to the setup [here](https://michaelheap.com/github-scheduled-reminders/){:target="_blank"}, and the result is shown in the image below:

![[https://michaelheap\.com/github\-scheduled\-reminders/](https://michaelheap.com/github-scheduled-reminders/){:target="_blank"}](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*kvqFXkIKIxP79Wm8vIaN0Q.png)

[https://michaelheap\.com/github\-scheduled\-reminders/](https://michaelheap.com/github-scheduled-reminders/){:target="_blank"}

**Question 4. GitHub PR messages, authors do not receive notifications:**

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*wmtXwXAcQZDXqInRd0ivPw.png)

> _This is a long-standing issue; the PR Slack message **actually does not notify the author when someone replies in the thread**. The Slack message sent by GitHub only tags Reviewers, not the Assignee or PR author._

At this point, GitHub Actions can be used to create an automation tool. We can add a Job to append the author tag at the end of the PR Description, so that when the message is sent to Slack, it will also tag the author’s Slack:
```bash
# Workflow(Action) Name
name: Pull Request Automation
# Please refer to the previous text, omitted....

  # ---------
  append-author-to-pr-description:
    name: Append author to PR description
    # Since this is a shared trigger event, we will determine in the Job that it only executes when the Pull Request is Opened (initially created), otherwise it will be Skipped
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action == 'opened'
    
    # If this Job fails, it does not affect the entire Workflow, and other Jobs continue
    continue-on-error: true
    
    # Set the maximum Timeout duration to prevent endless waiting in case of abnormal situations
    timeout-minutes: 10
    
    # Runner Label - Use GitHub Hosted Runner ubuntu-latest to execute the job
    # If it is a Private Repo, usage will be calculated, and exceeding may incur costs
    # However, this kind of automation task is not likely to exceed usage
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Append author to PR description
        env:
          # secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN is a Token automatically generated during GitHub Actions execution, no need to set it in Secrets, it has some GitHub Repo API Scopes permissions
          # gh (GitHub) CLI needs to inject GH_TOKEN into ENV for permission to operate
          # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/use-github_token-in-workflows
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

          #   ${{ github.xxx }} is a GitHub Actions Context expression
          #   It is not a Shell variable, but is replaced by GitHub Actions with the corresponding value during the YAML parsing phase
          #   Other parameters: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context
          PR_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          AUTHOR_TAG: '@${{ github.event.pull_request.user.login }}'
        run: |
          PR_BODY=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --repo ${{ github.repository }} --json body -q ".body")
          NEW_BODY=$(printf "%s\n\nCreated by %s" "$PR_BODY" "$AUTHOR_TAG")
          gh pr edit $PR_NUMBER --repo ${{ github.repository }} --body "$NEW_BODY"
```

**Complete Code: [Automation-PullRequest.yml](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/github-actions-ci-cd-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/Automation-PullRequest.yml){:target="_blank"}**

When opening a PR, it will automatically append the author information at the end of the description, and the Slack message will correctly tag the author:

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*UtTDtIQJ0vJks79UzCQSAQ.png)

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*MjVsFqE--xAq1zSQfCNVdQ.png)

**Question 5. GitHub sends too many notification emails, which is very distracting:**

After setting up GitHub Repo notifications and Slack, you can go to your GitHub personal settings to turn off email notifications:

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*INgfO9B2bNFy-Nd1ZjnzOw.png)

#### Others

Actions currently do not have a directory structure, but you can pin (Pin) five Actions at the top of the Actions page; you can also use Disable to pause a specific Action.

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*ZD-5xkparhJqtnm2REeu6A.png)

You can view GitHub Actions usage and execution performance in Insights:

### GitHub Actions Script Syntax Supplement

To clarify the variable syntax that you might find confusing: `${{ XXX }}`, `${XXX}`, or `$XXX`.

**Demo-Env-Vars-.yml:**
```yaml
name: Demo-Env-Vars

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  print-env-vars:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

```yaml
steps:
  - name: print-env

      # GitHub Actions Context expression, explained below
      FROM_REF: "${{ github.ref }}"
    run: |
      # Shell Script:
      # Referencing custom injected ENV variable content
      # ${SAY_MY_NAME} or $SAY_MY_NAME both work
      # ${XX} is more useful for string concatenation:
      echo "HI: ${SAY_MY_NAME}"
      
      # 💡 GitHub Actions Context expression
      # This is not a shell variable, but a value replaced by GitHub Actions during the YAML parsing phase
      # ⚠ It will fail if executed in a local or non-GitHub Actions environment
      # 🔗 https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context
      BRANCH_NAME_FROM_CONTEXT="${{ github.ref }}"
      
      # 💡 Environment variables during GitHub Actions execution
      # These variables are automatically injected by GitHub Actions when the runner executes the shell
      # ✅ In other environments, you can use export or ENV to predefine the same variables

```
#### $\{ \{ XXX \} \} GitHub Actions Context Expression

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*e3jpPuwdmf005cjbaXjAwQ.png)

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*ed5Wm7Xk48xuP8yQzHpJ9w.png)

- `${{ XXX }}` is a GitHub Actions Context expression, **which is replaced by GitHub Actions with the corresponding value during the YAML parsing phase** (as shown in the image `BRANCH_NAME_FROM_CONTEXT`)
- For a complete list of usable expressions, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context){:target="_blank"}
- `${XXX}` or `$XXX` are real environment variables, and `${XXX}` is more useful for string concatenation
- GitHub Actions automatically injects some environment variables; for a complete list, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables){:target="_blank"}

- In `github-script`, you can also use `${{ XXX }}` as a GitHub Actions Context expression, but it is not very meaningful; because **in the github-script environment, context variables are automatically injected for direct reference in JavaScript**
- In `github-script`, the `github` object is an instance of the Octokit REST API
- `github-script` can also inject variables from `env:`, but you need to access them using `${process.env.xxx}`
- It also automatically injects some environment variables; for a complete list, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables){:target="_blank"} Access using `${process.env.xxx}`; however, since there are already `context` variables, accessing them from here is not very meaningful

- `github-script` automatically includes `github-token`, no need to specify

#### gh cli GH\_TOKEN

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*NUfaaKIobZWVBuXrGg0TPw.png)

- When using `gh cli` in GitHub Actions Shell Script, you need to specify the `GH_TOKEN` parameter
- You can directly use the default Token — `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatically generated during GitHub Actions execution)
- **The default Token has some basic permissions; if the command you want to execute does not have enough permissions, you need to use a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/use-github_token-in-workflows){:target="_blank"}**; it is recommended to create a PAT using a shared account for team use.

GitHub Actions has been developed; the next step is to replace the GitHub Hosted Runner with our own Self-hosted Runner.

> _GitHub Hosted Runner has a free quota of 2,000 minutes per month (starting), running such small automation tasks does not take much time, and since it runs on a Linux machine, the cost is very low, possibly not even reaching the free limit; **there is no need to switch to a Self-hosted Runner**; changing the Runner also requires ensuring the Runner environment is correct (for example, GitHub Hosted Runner comes with gh cli, while self-hosted Runner needs to be installed manually), **this article purely makes this switch for educational purposes**._

> _If it is used for executing CI/CD tasks, then a Self-hosted Runner is necessary._

#### Adding a Self-hosted Runner

> _This article uses **macOS M1** as an example._

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*mEInaj-tLaprMAa2OfowCw.png)

- Settings → Actions → Runners → New self-hosted runner.
- **Runner image:** macOS
- **Architecture**: For M1, remember to select ARM64 for better performance

**Open a Terminal on your physical computer.**

**Follow the Download steps to complete on your local computer:**
```bash
# Create a Runner directory at your desired path
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
# Download the Runner image
curl -o actions-runner-osx-x64-2.325.0.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.325.0/actions-runner-osx-x64-2.325.0.tar.gz

# Optional: Validate the hash
echo "0562bd934b27ca0c6d8a357df00809fbc7b4d5524d4aeb6ec152e14fd520a4c3  actions-runner-osx-x64-2.325.0.tar.gz" | shasum -a 256 -c

# Unzip
tar xzf ./actions-runner-osx-x64-2.325.0.tar.gz
```

> _The above is just a reference; it is recommended to follow the steps on your settings page to get the latest version of the Runner image._

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*Q0k0EPjrY2V4owseESe5lg.png)

**Configure Settings:**
```bash
# Please refer to the commands on the settings page; the Token will change over time
./config.sh --url https://github.com/ORG/REPO --token XXX
```

You will be prompted to enter:
- Enter the name of the runner group to add this runner to: \[press Enter for Default\] **just press Enter**
*Only runners registered at the Organization level have the Group feature
- Enter the name of runner: \[press Enter for ZhgChgLiMacBook-Pro\] **You can enter the desired Runner name e.g.** `app-runner-1` **or just press Enter**
- This runner will have the following labels: ‘self-hosted’, ‘macOS’, ‘X64’
Enter any additional labels (e.g. label-1,label-2): \[press Enter to skip\] 
**Enter the desired Runner label; you can add multiple custom Labels for convenience later** 
As mentioned earlier, GitHub Actions/Runner finds tasks based on corresponding Labels, **if you only use the default label, the Runner may pick up other Runners in the organization to execute tasks, so it's safest to customize one**. 
Here, I randomly set a label `self-hosted-zhgchgli`
- Enter name of work folder: \[press Enter for \_work\] **just press Enter**

When you see √ Settings Saved, it means the configuration is complete.

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*yxLfii0rWhzsiFuYVmPgFw.png)

**Start the Runner:**
```bash
./run.sh
```

When you see √ Connected to GitHub, Listening for Jobs, it means it is now listening for Actions tasks:

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*1RmPPOosAoCxHA9tg_WE2w.png)

> **_This Terminal window should not be closed as it will continue to receive tasks._** 

> **_🚀🚀🚀 You can open multiple Terminals on the same computer in different directories to run multiple Runners._** 

**Back in the Repo settings page, you can also see the Runner waiting for tasks:**

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*jjq5NTPYMuC3gH3ey_VTtg.png)

**Status:**
- Idle: Idle, waiting for tasks
- Active: A task is currently being executed
- Offline: Runner is not online

#### Workflow (GitHub Actions) Change to Self-hosted Runner

Using `Automation-PullRequest.yml` as an example:
```yaml
# Please refer to the previous text, omitted....
jobs:
  label-pr-by-file-count:
    # Please refer to the previous text, omitted....
    runs-on: [self-hosted-zhgchgli]
    # Please refer to the previous text, omitted....
  # ---------
  assign-self-if-no-assignee:
    # Please refer to the previous text, omitted....
    runs-on: [self-hosted-zhgchgli]

    steps:
      # Please refer to the previous text, omitted....
```

After committing the file to the main branch of the Repo, reopen the PR to trigger and verify the Actions.

**Back in the Runner Terminal, you can see a new task coming in, executing and the execution results:**

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*Hu0DxKQbenPmBEw8swv65A.png)

It failed because my local computer does not have the [gh cli](https://github.com/cli/cli){:target="_blank"} environment installed:

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*9xguacdPATIeEZdbFszmHw.png)

After installing gh on the physical computer using `brew install gh`, trigger the execution again:

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*TbkAt00K89Ysbix33dK8ZA.png)

Success! Now this task is completely executed on our own computer, without using GitHub Hosted Runner, and without incurring costs.

**We can click into the Action Log to see which Runner and machine the task was executed on:**

![](/assets/404bd5c70040/1*oqLcWfn6cbWsCt9fVsrikQ.png)

#### runs-on: \[ **Runner Label\] Setting

Here it is AND, not OR; GitHub Runner does not currently support OR selection of Runners for execution.

For example: `[self-hosted, macOS, app]` → means the Runner must **have all** `self-hosted, macOS, app` three Labels to match and take on tasks.

If a Job wants to test results under different Runner environments simultaneously, you can use the `matrix` parameter:
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.runner }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        runner:
          - [self-hosted, linux, high-memory]
          - [self-hosted, macos, xcode-15]

    steps:
      - run: echo "Running on ${{ matrix.runner }}"
```

This way, this Job will execute once in parallel on the following two Runner Labels:
- self-hosted, linux, high-memory
- self-hosted, macos, xcode-15

> **_Runners currently do not support:_** 

> _\- OR selection of Runners_ 

> _\- Runner weight settings_ 

#### Registering Runner as a Service

You can refer to the official documentation on "[Configuring the self-hosted runner application as a service](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/configuring-the-self-hosted-runner-application-as-a-service?platform=mac){:target="_blank"}" to register the Runner directly as a system Service, allowing it to run in the background (without needing to keep the Terminal open) and automatically start after boot.

If you have multiple Runners, remember to adjust the "[Customizing the self-hosted runner service](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/configuring-the-self-hosted-runner-application-as-a-service?platform=mac#customizing-the-self-hosted-runner-service-1){:target="_blank"}" settings to register with different names.

> _I have a problem to investigate regarding iOS, **which is that after switching to a background Service, I encountered an error during Archive (suspected to be related to keychain permissions)**; I didn't have time to resolve it at the time, so I continued using the foreground Terminal Runner._

If you want to achieve automatic startup on boot in the traditional foreground method, you need to add an auto-start configuration file in `~/Library/LaunchAgents`:

`actions.runner.REPO.RUNNER_NAME.plist` :
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
 <dict>
  <key>Label</key>
  <string>actions.runner.REPO.RUNNER_NAME</string>
  <!-- Specify Terminal.app to start -->
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
   <string>/usr/bin/open</string>
   <string>-a</string>
   <string>Terminal</string>
   <string>/Users/zhgchgli/Documents/actions-runner/run.sh</string>
  </array>
  <key>RunAtLoad</key>
  <true/>
  <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
  <string>/Users/zhgchgli/Documents/actions-runner</string>
 </dict>
</plist>
```

> _Friends interested in delving deeper into DevOps can refer to the official [k8s Runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/runners/about-actions-runner-controller#scaling-runners){:target="_blank"} documentation._
