### What Can We Remember as the App Product Reaches Its Final Destination?

Using mitmproxy \+ Apple Configurator to keep the App in a pre-removal state forever

### Introduction

![Jujutsu Kaisen](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*8RN-xVJROfLwtovgkvHDwA.jpeg)

Jujutsu Kaisen

After working for a long time and handling many products, I have started to encounter products I once participated in that are about to reach their final destination (removal). Developing a product from scratch is like nurturing a new life; our team worked hard for 3â€“4 months to bring this "child" into the world. Although it has since been handed over to other caregivers (engineers) for further development, hearing that it is about to enter the end of its product life cycle still brings a tinge of regret.

> **_Life is like this; we never know whether tomorrow the sun will rise first or an unexpected event will occur. The only thing we can do is cherish the present and do our best._**

#### Remembrance

Every journey leaves a trace. We hope to do something before the product reaches its final destination, allowing everyone a chance to reminisce and at least leave proof of its existence. The following methods require the App to still be online; if it has already been removed, only memories remain.

### Non-Technical Method â€” Recording

In addition to directly using the [iPhone's built-in screen recording feature](https://support.apple.com/zh-tw/102653){:target="_blank"}, we can also use QuickTime Player to connect the phone to a Mac and record the screen, exporting the video.
1. Open QuickTime Player on your Mac

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*UVkfiLbcYU8YuZEPdbJaOg.png)

2. In the top left corner, select "File" -> "New Movie Recording"

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*VcRN0FExy-CA7sExHtMT6w.png)

3. When the recording interface pops up, click the "v" next to the red button, and select your connected phone for the screen and audio options.

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*SN0XL8Zt0UlBizXiIqZiyA.png)

4. The recording interface will now display your phone's screen.

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*MSuecaACmg3ZNMnGpDkRFQ.png)

Click the "ðŸ”´" to start recording, then return to your phone to operate the content you want to record.

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*bxL9Dq1IWgbrlSfKO6skLQ.png)

While recording, the current video size will be displayed. To stop recording, click the "ðŸ”´" again.

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*VxWQNHF_PX5CZAkjJEXPbQ.png)

You can easily trim the video using the QuickTime Player toolbar. Finally, press "Command" \+ "s" to export and save the video to a specified location, completing the recording.

The advantage of video memories is that they are easier to connect in the future than images. The deeper the recording, the more detailed the documentation. If you want to convert specific frames into images, you can also take screenshots directly, which is very convenient.

### Technical Method

App technical backups can be divided into two directions: the "skeleton" of the App itself is merely a framework, while the "flesh" consists of API Response Data, which is the core content of the App.
- The skeleton will disappear when the App is removed from the App Store.
- The flesh will disappear when the API host or server is shut down.

Thus, we also divide the backup into two technical methods: one for the skeleton and one for the flesh.

#### Disclaimer

#### \[Skeleton\] Backup .ipa App Installation File

Once the App is removed from the store, as long as the App has been downloaded on the phone and not actively deleted, it will remain on that phone. If you switch phones, you can transfer it over as well.

However, if we accidentally delete the App or do not transfer it when changing phones, then it will be a permanent goodbye. At this point, if we have manually backed up the .ipa file from the store, we can revive it.

A long time ago, an article on [reverse engineering](../7498e1ff93ce/) mentioned this, but this time we only need to back up the .ipa file without needing to crack it, using only the tools provided by Apple.

**1. Install [Apple Configurator 2](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/apple-configurator/id1037126344?mt=12){:target="_blank"}**

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*_RzuFIVGV9T_-xJ53H8fGA.png)

First, go to the Mac App Store to download and install [Apple Configurator 2](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/apple-configurator/id1037126344?mt=12){:target="_blank"}.

**2. Connect your iPhone to your Mac and click to trust the computer.**

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*EiSQmOkDCW73kYhJWbTipQ.png)

Once connected successfully, the iPhone's home screen will appear.

**3. Ensure your phone has the App you want to back up installed.**

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*QD9M4uM9eyKSixzu8AdKbw.png)

We need to trigger the replacement screen in Apple Configurator 2 to obtain the .ipa file downloaded to temporary storage, so we must first ensure that the target App is installed on the phone.

**4. Return to Apple Configurator 2 on your Mac.**

Double-click the iPhone's home screen displayed above to enter the information page.

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*X_y5uGhRRIq7VQuW4PkYBg.png)

Switch to "Apps" -> click the "+" in the upper right corner -> "Apps."

After logging into your App Store account, you can access the list of Apps you have previously purchased.

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*uAyjPD75-MGokHCbDoC_4g.png)

Search for the target App you want to back up, select it, and click "Add."

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*T-v1CNrmc7T4MpeyAX0c7A.png)

A waiting window will appear, indicating that the App is being added and downloaded.

**5. Extract the .ipa file**

> **_Just wait for it to finish downloading, and a prompt will appear asking if you want to replace the existing installed App._**

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*9f54be4lixn4ezKhwRJrtg.png)

> **_At this point, do not click anything. Do not click anything. Do not click anything._**

Open a Finder window:

In the top left corner, select "Go" -> "Go to Folder."

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*JgXWca5hKROuoOgLThkQnw.png)

Paste the following path:
```bash
~/Library/Group Containers/K36BKF7T3D.group.com.apple.configurator/Library/Caches/Assets/TemporaryItems/MobileApps
```

You will find the target App's .ipa file that is being prepared for installation:

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*zV5yWozKqXtwekI33NWwVg.png)

Copy it out to complete the backup of the App's .ipa file.

After copying the file, return to Apple Configurator 2 and click stop to terminate the operation.

#### \[Skeleton\] Restore .ipa App Installation File

Similarly, connect the phone from which you want to restore the App to your Mac and open Apple Configurator 2 to enter the App addition interface.

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*6miYYw5QL6iqLQqrtHOi2A.png)

For restoration, select "Choose from My Mac..." in the lower left corner.

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*7a_25rE2eDpMFZqBC3sP6g.png)

Select the backed-up App .ipa file and click "Add."

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*AcGEAuowmvvGRb-E22wu2g.png)

Wait for the transfer and installation to complete, and you can reopen the App on your phone, successfully reviving it!

#### \[Flesh\] Backup the Last API Response Data

Here, we will use the method mentioned in the previous article [**App End-to-End Testing Local Snapshot API Mock Server**](../5a5c4b25a83d/) (for detailed principles, please refer to it) along with the open-source project created at that time:

[![](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/686628812/44cf2ec7-4de1-4a10-b213-bf7dd30748a4)](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/mitmproxy-rodo/tree/main){:target="_blank"}

Using the same technique of recording API Requests & Responses for E2E Testing, we can also use it to document the last API Request & Response Data before the App is removed or goes offline.

**1. Install [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/){:target="_blank"}**
```typescript
brew install mitmproxy
```

mitmproxy is an open-source man-in-the-middle attack tool for sniffing network requests.

If you are not familiar with how Mitmproxy works, you can refer to my previous article: "[The App Uses HTTPS for Transmission, but Data is Still Stolen.](../46410aaada00/)" or the [Mitmproxy official documentation](https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/overview-getting-started/){:target="_blank"}.

If you are using it purely for network request sniffing and are not accustomed to the mimproxy interface, you can also switch to using [Proxyman](https://proxyman.io/){:target="_blank"}; refer to my previous [article](../70a1409b149a/) for usage.

**2. Complete mitmproxy certificate setup**

> _For HTTPS encrypted connections, we need to use a root certificate for the man-in-the-middle attack, so the first time you use it, you must complete the download and activation of the root certificate on your phone._

> _\*If your App & API Server has implemented SSL Pinning, you will also need to add the Pinning certificate to mitmproxy._

- First, ensure that your iPhone and Mac are connected to the same network.
- If there is no WiFi, you can connect the computer to a physical network and [enable the WiFi sharing feature on your Mac](https://applealmond.com/posts/92291){:target="_blank"} to allow the phone to connect to the Mac's network.

In the Terminal, start `mitmproxy` or `mitmweb` (Web GUI version).
```typescript
mitmproxy
```

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*xruNW5ZUPNuxVJvKOyPQTA.png)

Seeing this screen means that the mitmproxy service has started. Currently, there is no traffic coming in, so it is empty. Do not close the Terminal while on this screen.
- Go to Mac's network settings to check the Mac's IP address.

Return to your phone's WiFi settings, click "i" to enter detailed settings, and find "Configure Proxy" at the bottom:

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*zXVilpUXnXakpWib007BPA.png)

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*QV6reSNc0AJg7sQa2qiCjQ.png)

- Enter the Mac's IP address in the server field.
- Enter 8080 in the port field.
- Save.

**Open Safari on your phone and enter: [http://mitm\.it/](http://mitm.it/){:target="_blank"}**

If you see:
```kotlin
If you can see this, traffic is not passing through mitmproxy.
```

It means the network proxy on your phone has not been set up successfully or mitmproxy is not running on your Mac.

Under normal circumstances, you should see:

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*Ks5IHpi2AoPj4wXu5ZH9VA.png)

> _At this point, only HTTP traffic can be sniffed; HTTPS traffic will show an error. We will continue with the setup._

This indicates a successful connection. We find the iOS section and click "Get mimproxy-ca-cert.pem."

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*HvIg0jtUQ5ops519YUA52A.png)

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*tU3gi3PBvrbUc-tqKjUD9w.png)

- Click "Allow."

Once the download is complete, go to your phone's settings, where "Profile Downloaded" will appear. Click to enter.

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*JzX7U1jCtda915mGz5CPjw.png)

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*mWmVPZ-au302NGHXgCxAow.png)

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*SMnr82MEIo4YaYOvTpILeQ.png)

- Click to enter, then click "Install" in the upper right corner and enter your phone password to complete the installation.

Return to Settings -> "General" -> "About" -> scroll down to "Certificate Trust Settings" -> enable "mitmproxy."

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*UOcYlpOolfWithLb517__g.png)

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*LAoe10TplFdfWXEHMRAvWw.png)

- Click "Continue" to complete the activation.

At this point, we have completed all the preparatory work for the man-in-the-middle attack.

> _Remember that all traffic from your phone will go through the proxy from your Mac. **After finishing, remember to go back to your phone's network settings and turn off the proxy server settings**, otherwise, your phone's WiFi will not connect to the external network._

Return to the Terminal mitmproxy, and while operating the App on your phone, you will see all the captured API request records.

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*-aRzC2HWRCvGok-L9jbjHA.png)

Each request can be entered to view detailed Request & Response content:

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*IyO00OEpAadapGKNtOV_Mg.png)

This is the basic setup and practical work of mitmproxy.

**3. Sniffing and Understanding API Structure**

Next, we will use the `mitmdump` service from mitmproxy combined with the [**mitmproxy-rodo**](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/mitmproxy-rodo/tree/main){:target="_blank"} [addons](https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/addons-overview/){:target="_blank"} I developed to record requests and replay them.

> [_My implementation principle_](../5a5c4b25a83d/) _is to calculate the Request parameters into a Hash value. During replay, the request is calculated again, and if a backup Response with the same Hash value is found locally, it is returned. If there are multiple requests with the same Hash value, they are stored and replayed in order._

We can first sniff the App's API using the above method (or using [Proxyman](https://proxyman.io/){:target="_blank"}), observing which fields may affect Hash Mapping. We can record these and exclude them in subsequent settings. **For example, some APIs always include the `?ts` parameter, which does not affect the returned content but does affect the Hash value calculation, preventing us from finding local backups. We need to identify and exclude these in later settings.**

**4. Set up [mitmproxy-rodo](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/mitmproxy-rodo/tree/main){:target="_blank"}:**

Use the open-source script I wrote for recording and replaying.

> **_For detailed parameter settings, please refer to the documentation of the open-source project._**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ZhgChgLi/mitmproxy-rodo.git
cd mitmproxy-rodo
```

```markdown
Fill in the parameters selected in the previous step 3 into the config.json configuration file:
```json
{
  "ignored": {
    "*": {
      "*": {
        "*": {
          "iterable": false,
          "enables": [
            "query",
            "formData"
          ],
          "rules": {
            "query": {
              "parameters": [
                "ts",
                "connect_id",
                "device_id",
                "device_name"
              ]
            },
            "formData": {
              "parameters": [
                "aidck",
                "device_id",
                "ver_name"
              ]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The above parameters will be excluded when calculating the Hash value, and specific exclusion rules can be set for individual Endpoint paths.

**5\. Enable recording, and execute the following in Terminal:**
```bash
mitmdump -s rodo.py --set dumper_folder=zhgchgli --set config_file=config.json --set record=true "~d zhgchg.li"
```
- The ending `"~d zhgchg.li"` means to only capture traffic for \* \.zhgchg\.li.
- `dumper_folder`: The name of the output directory.

**6\. Go back to the mobile device and operate the target App to execute the desired recording process path.**
- It is recommended to restart or reinstall the App to start the operation in the cleanest way.
- It is suggested to use screen recording to help remember the steps for reproduction.

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*SeivG1XaRcd5uq2uMkyrSA.png)

While operating, you will see that the output directory will have many captured API Response Data, organized by Domain -> API Path -> HTTP Method -> Hash Value -> Header-X / Content-X (if the same Hash request is made twice, it will be stored in order).
- To re-record, you can simply delete the output directory to allow it to capture again.
- **If the returned data contains personal information, please remember to adjust the captured content for anonymization.**

#### \[Meat\] Replay the captured API Response Data

After recording, be sure to try replaying once to test if the data is normal. If the Hash Hit is very low (almost no corresponding Response found during replay), you can repeat the sniffing steps to find the variable that affects the Hash value each time the App is executed and exclude it.

**Execute Replay:**
```bash
mitmdump -s rodo.py --set dumper_folder=zhgchgli --set config_file=config.json
```
- `dumper_folder`: The name of the output directory.
- By default, if there is no Hash Mapping to the Response Data locally, it will directly return 404, leaving the App blank, which allows you to know whether the captured data is valid.

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*0Cjy_5RZRq3tvE1Pc0lQ9A.png)

![](/assets/b04f4fba3cf2/1*JKorlo3EBeSWXhB9Exw4ZA.png)

- Pages that were traversed during the recording will display again during replay: OK!
- Pages that were not traversed during the recording will show a network error during replay: OK!

### Remembrance

At this point, we can recreate the last moments before the App reached its endpoint by restoring the skeleton and the final meat, reminiscing about the time when everyone worked together to produce it.

This article is dedicated to the team from my first job and the journey from web backend development to iOS App development, independently creating something from scratch in a short period of 3â€“4 months, successfully producing a product with Android, design, PM supervisors, and backend colleagues. Although it is about to enter the end of its life cycle, I will always remember the bittersweet moments and the excitement of seeing it go live and being used for the first time.
