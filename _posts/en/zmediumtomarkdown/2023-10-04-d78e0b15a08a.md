### \[Travel Journal\] 2023 Kyushu 10-Day Solo Trip

10-Day Free Travel in Kyushu: A Brief Record of Fukuoka, Nagasaki, and Kumamoto

### \[2024 Update\] Second Visit to Kyushu
- [June 2024 Second Visit to Kyushu (9 Days + 2 Days in Korea)](../cb65fd5ab770/) 
[Entering Japan's Hakata from Busan, South Korea via the New Camellia Cruise, traveling through Yufuin, Oita, Fukuoka, Shimonoseki, Isahaya, and Sasebo](../cb65fd5ab770/)

### Introduction

At the end of August, I officially left Pinkoi, where I had been for nearly three years. I had been contemplating leaving for a while, and in the first half of the year, I thought about taking a break to clear my mind and see how things would go upon my return. So, I traveled with friends to “[Travel Journal] 2023 Kansai & 🇯🇵 First Landing](../76d66c2e34af/)” and with colleagues to “[Travel Journal] 2023 Tokyo & 🇯🇵 Second Landing](../9da2c51fa4f2/)”; however, after returning, I felt an even stronger desire to truly break free. Just as my current tasks were wrapping up, I gathered the courage to step out of my comfort zone and seek the next new challenge!

The “[Travel Journal] 9/11 Nagoya One-Day Flash Trip](../7b8a0563c157/)” was purely accidental, as mentioned in the text, it felt more like a military march than a relaxing trip.

Taking advantage of this rare opportunity, I decided to explore Japan once more. The original plan was to travel with a friend who was also unemployed along the **🇰🇷 Busan ➡️ 🇯🇵 Fukuoka ➡️ 🇯🇵 Kumamoto route**; from Korea to Kumamoto, I could take the [New Camellia](https://journey.tw/new-camellia/){:target="_blank"} from Busan to Fukuoka, which would take about 12 hours overnight, effectively combining commuting and accommodation.

However, my friend found a job in September and couldn’t join me, and I couldn’t find a new travel companion in time. Traveling alone, I didn’t want to move around too much, so I decided to skip the 🇰🇷 Busan ➡️ 🇯🇵 Fukuoka segment and instead travel from 🇯🇵 Fukuoka ➡️ 🇯🇵 Kumamoto, entering Kumamoto from Fukuoka.

With my schedule becoming quite scattered in October and wanting to start preparing for a new job, I set my departure date for the end of September (9/17–9/26).
### Summary / Retro

As usual, I wrote the summary and reflections at the beginning. I came across a quote in a free travel group that I really liked: “Free travel is about continuously paying tuition (spending time or money) to learn; the more experiences you have, the fewer pitfalls you will encounter.”

👍
- Coca-Cola, peach water, FamilyMart's juice drinks, and autumn plum wine were delicious!
- Japanese professional baseball is worth watching! When buying tickets, remember to choose seats that are either completely empty or near the aisle; just get the cheaper seats.
- The JR Pass may not always save you money, but it definitely did in Kyushu! I saved at least over 1,000 TWD.
- Traveling solo led to many interesting experiences; for example, I helped a Japanese family get souvenirs from Mihara City, a kind foreign sister took photos for me, I met a Taiwanese family on a boat, walked with a TSMC brother in Aso, and helped a family take photos in Kumamoto only to run into them again at the airport and help them take another photo… and so on.
- Kyushu (not just Kumamoto) is filled with Kumamon's presence.
- The entire Kyushu is very spacious, with hardly any crowds; popular restaurants and attractions rarely have lines, making it very comfortable.
- My Japanese improved a little; I could understand numbers (though I still needed to confirm with Google Translate to ensure I pronounced them correctly), whether to use plastic bags; I learned phrases for checkout, this, that’s enough, cash, credit card, and tax-free requests (XXX お願いします).
- I completed writing the travel journal!

👎
- This time I stayed at a hotel that was disappointing:
When looking for hotels in Japan, it’s still important to check reviews, preferably looking directly at the low-rated reviews to see if I can accept them, and then check the street view to see if it’s easy to navigate.
- I spent too many days in Kumamoto; it should have been just 2 days, and I could have gone to Oita on other days. Also, Fukuoka is actually much closer to Kumamoto than Fukuoka to Nagasaki:
In the past, I would first look for accommodation and then attractions, but Kyushu is vast; I should have first identified the places I wanted to visit and then arranged accommodation, which would allow for more attractions.
- The choices, prices, and quality of accommodation in Fukuoka are far better than in Kumamoto.
- I missed the Yufuin festival (I went to Nagasaki that day):
Next time, I should check if there are any festivals on the dates I plan to go; everyone recommends attending festivals, and I definitely want to go.
- The JR Pass can be used for the Shinkansen, but not for the “Nozomi” and “Mizuho” trains; if you take them, you need to pay the difference.
- Traveling solo + language barriers can be quite lonely; more often than not, it’s about enjoying solitude in silence.
- Finding accommodation while traveling solo is relatively expensive.
- I still rushed through attractions this time; I should slow down and enjoy the moment while searching for good food; especially in Japan, once mealtime passes, you can’t find famous restaurants anymore.
- The sun in Kyushu during this season is still quite strong, so proper sun protection is necessary.
- Northern Nagasaki is average (Holland, Chinatown), while Southern Nagasaki has more distinctive night views.

### Preparations
#### Travel

Initially, I considered entering and exiting Fukuoka, with a round trip to Kumamoto (which later proved to be the right choice XD, as there aren't many attractions in Kumamoto, so there's no need to stay too many days); I found a China Airlines flight that goes from Fukuoka to Kumamoto and back, which was also cheap at $1,000, so I decided on this flight.

Since I had plenty of time, I chose the most luxurious option of departing at noon and returning at noon, totaling 10 days including flight time.
- Outbound: 9/17 CI 116 16:40 TPE -> 20:00 FUK
- Return: 9/26 CI 2195 ( [New Route on 9/26](https://event.liontravel.com/zh-tw/chinaairlines/index){:target="_blank"} ) 12:30 KMJ -> 13:34 TPE

Price: **$10,048**

Since Kyushu is vast, I purchased the [JR Pass North Kyushu Rail Pass](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/3494-jr-kyushu-rail-pass?cid=19365&ud1=d78e0b15a08a){:target="_blank"} (5 days), thinking it would be worth it no matter how I traveled.
#### Accommodation (9 Nights)

I didn't think too much or research when arranging, as I hadn't been to Fukuoka or Kumamoto before; I decided on a half-and-half split of 5 days in Fukuoka and 4 days in Kumamoto.

[**Fukuoka 5 Nights — Benikea Calton Hotel Fukuoka Tenjin**](https://www.agoda.com/zh-tw/benikea-calton-hotel-fukuoka-tenjin/hotel/fukuoka-jp.html?cid=1844104){:target="_blank"} **( [Benikea Calton Hotel Fukuoka Tenjin](https://www.agoda.com/zh-tw/benikea-calton-hotel-fukuoka-tenjin/hotel/fukuoka-jp.html?cid=1844104){:target="_blank"} )**

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*6WNdqS0fAb8NOn79hG7_xQ.png)

- Price: $7,583, $1,516/night
- Transportation: From Hakata Station, you can take the Nanakuma Line subway to Watanabedori Station or take a bus for a 5-minute walk.

JR Kumamoto -> Hotel

![Hotel -> Kumamoto Airport](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*WapnHlitUflFJEykcWznKg.png)

Hotel -> Kumamoto Airport

Finding accommodation in Kumamoto is quite difficult (not sure if it's because TSMC has booked everything), with fewer options, higher prices than Fukuoka, and older facilities; in the end, I only found this relatively cheaper hotel.
- Price: $8,157, $2,039/night
- Transportation: After exiting JR Kumamoto Station, transfer to the Hōhi Main Line and then take the tram to reach the destination (Shiritsu Taiikukan-mae Station). **The return trip to the airport is also very convenient, with direct buses to Kumamoto Airport right outside.**

Once the hotel is booked, you can fill out the online [Entry Application](../76d66c2e34af/).
#### Fun

**The original plan is as follows:**
- 9/17 21:00 Arrive in Fukuoka 22:00 Arrive at the hotel, should stroll around the street stalls
- 9/18 Nagasaki (Shinchi Chinatown/Dutch Slope/Glover Garden/Oura Cathedral/Gunkanjima Digital Museum/Meganebashi) may not visit all + Atomic Bomb Museum + Peace Park + Night view from the top of Inasayama
- 9/19 Yanagawa, Dazaifu day trip + LaLaport Fukuoka (optional)
- 9/20 Mojiko, Kokura Castle day trip + street stalls
- 9/21 Shopping in Hakata (Fukuoka Tower, shrines, Canal City, Tenjin Underground Shopping Mall…)
- 9/22 Shopping in Hakata + move to Kumamoto + Suizenji Jojuen
- 9/23 Kumamoto city, Kumamoto Castle, Kumamon's office visit
- 9/24 Aso Volcano day trip
- 9/25 Shimabara Castle, Shimabara Sanbiki Inu (very far, under consideration)
- 9/26 10:00 Kumamoto Airport 12:30 Departure back home

#### Go!


> [Flight Tracker, iPhone Suica usage, Visit Japan pre-entry application… previously mentioned in earlier articles, so I won't elaborate here.](../76d66c2e34af/) 

**This time was also very impulsive, bought the tickets on 9/10 + booked the hotel, planned the itinerary on 9/15, and departed on 9/17!**
### Day 1 Departure

The flight is at 16:40, giving plenty of time to wake up slowly and head out.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*56nCHSI-rbX3tPMwbDcSRg.jpeg)

After arriving at the A1 Taipei Station via the airport MRT, I chose to check in early, completing the check-in and baggage drop-off at Taipei Main Station, so I could go straight to immigration at the airport without queuing at the counter \( [For early check-in information, please refer to the official website](https://web.taoyuan-airport.com/ITCI/mobile/index.html){:target="_blank"} \).

This time, I also placed an Airtag in my checked luggage to track its location, so I’m not worried about losing my luggage, and it’s very convenient while waiting at the baggage claim.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*-nIFAK7u_6p-LnkhEA3V6A.jpeg)

Around 13:00, I arrived at the airport and wandered around.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ewBdzikh22mnp_ucoRm0gg.jpeg)

I casually had some expensive yet ordinary mouth-watering chicken and checked the luggage location; my luggage had also followed me to the airport.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ZGbZ8VD8IaKod7rErIVNpg.jpeg)

After finishing my meal, it was around 14:30, and I casually bought a Japanese language book as a last-minute effort.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*WfZd9deoaDEmrskkoXQPiA.jpeg)

Encountered other planes mistakenly using the wrong runway, causing the entire airport to reset; the plane took a long detour before taking off, resulting in a delay of nearly 30 minutes; the old plane had a very small TV.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*mkX2qNrBXN2yur_rPbsbdg.png)

[China Airlines collaborates with Wutong to create the cutest dessert in the sky](https://www.china-airlines.com/hk/zh/discover/news/press-release/20230628){:target="_blank"}, featuring [Dinotaeng](https://www.instagram.com/dinotaeng/){:target="_blank"}, the adorable short-tailed kangaroo, and the osmanthus oolong tea was quite good.

Due to the flight delay, I only exited the airport around 21:00.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*n3lI2GX5YyaltKnSTcakIw.png)

After leaving the airport, I saw a sign indicating the direction to go and where to wait for the bus; besides going to Hakata, there are also other destinations. You can refer to [this article](https://carolblogtw.com/fukuoka-airport/){:target="_blank"} or the [official website](https://www.fukuoka-airport.jp/tw/access/bus.html){:target="_blank"}; if you plan to go far, remember to check the schedule.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*BSOaCHx5tjKbhcO5EAVVeg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*dzpkNAi-cpFVA2PtY2XzTA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*0nkVxPYO-eEWwThWus1Wzw.jpeg)

Originally, I planned to take the No. 2 bus directly to Hakata Station, but it seemed that the last bus would still require waiting for another hour (I forgot), so I switched to the No. 1 bus to Fukuoka Airport Domestic Terminal (Fukuoka Airport Subway Station), then took the subway to Hakata and transferred to the Nanakuma Line to Watanabe-dori Station.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*UVQjogUlXohb6VE7UlM1OQ.png)

#### Hello Fukuoka!

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*uWjFOSARS7vYrTmGv_bliA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*6FSEw2CQ8PacJq4nlKmI7w.jpeg)

The left side of the second photo is the hotel where I will be staying.

[![Benikea Calton Hotel Fukuoka Tenjin 2023/09](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1e2d_hqdefault.jpg "Benikea Calton Hotel Fukuoka Tenjin 2023/09")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837lB5SU0_s){:target="_blank"}

A brief overview of the hotel: it feels somewhat old, the lighting is dim, sound insulation is average, and the air conditioning is a bit noisy, but it is still clean and tidy; however, I do regret not spending a little more to stay at the nearby APA chain hotel.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*8u9eCa1nq5UxAV-acxyOvA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Cm_9kJWIgj9gai3p3_f5Pg.jpeg)

I originally planned to visit the food stalls on the first night, but I was too tired, so I opted for a convenience store meal instead, resting early to prepare for the next day's itinerary.

### Day 2 Nagasaki

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*zpI5hLSzOSGi9PF_55bAiw.jpeg)

In the morning, I looked out from the bed to see the view of Fukuoka city.

#### Hakata Station

Taking the subway to Hakata is a bit of a detour; it's faster to walk to Watanabe-dori and take the bus to Hakata.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Hh2uKnW5LOxr3rMm_gJUqA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*VrtZ-2BmRfE6i4O9pAHC-Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*6lQeBVnwqX_RGVxKpv4jiQ.png)

After arriving in Hakata, I first went to the manned counter to exchange my JR Pass (showing my passport) and reserved a seat for the trip to Nagasaki. There were many foreigners exchanging JR Passes, and I waited for nearly an hour, so I recommend leaving early or exchanging it in advance.

> **_The JR Kyushu Pass can currently only be exchanged at manual counters. Please arrive early to queue for the exchange. If there are too many people at Hakata Station, you can [consider exchanging at nearby stations, which will be faster!](https://www.jrkyushu.co.jp/chinese/railpass/how_to_purchase/reception_place.html){:target="_blank"}_** 

> I bought a five-day pass, which is valid for five days starting from the day of exchange. You can enter and exit the station using this pass (the one with the date & amount), and the reserved seat ticket is just to let you know where your seat is; it cannot be used to enter or exit the station. Keep this pass safe, as you will need it for these five days. If you lose it, it's gone!

There are two segments from Hakata to Nagasaki. You will first arrive at Takeo Onsen and then transfer to Nagasaki from there. You can change trains on the same platform, and they have calculated the train schedules, so basically, after arriving, just walk directly across to board the train.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*cI0jD1E3tCg7E9V6363cvg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*c9EfwoqERxFzuja4HRSMlw.jpeg)

While waiting for the train, I noticed that the trains in Kyushu are very distinctive!!

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*OYHKAqia_USajIQg9mtfFg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*BppaK4ObuJjcoEwAqZqJ7w.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*SU23c3I-iQCPi2WsMVpGJQ.jpeg)

The seats are spacious and comfortable, and you can enjoy the scenery from the window.

**Travel time: approximately 1 hour and 50 minutes**

**A little episode: completing a national diplomacy ✅**

> On the train, I sat next to a family. The parents took their two children out for a trip, and halfway through the ride, one of the kids suddenly threw up. The dad, not having any tissues at the moment, had to use a newspaper, so I handed him some tissues and wet wipes.

> When getting off the train, the dad gave me a souvenir from Mihara City (shrimp rice crackers).

#### Nagasaki Station

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Xp1rdLz4dD0usrC8CtbqVQ.jpeg)

The weather was great after leaving Nagasaki Station! I was initially worried it would rain today.

After exiting, I headed towards the Nagasaki streetcar direction to board.

#### Nagasaki (South)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*V_xgDt2K73DSpBc5W063kA.png)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*h4UJDTlqk4ayv69IfY-MhQ.jpeg)

The first stop was to head south to explore Nagasaki Shinchi Chinatown.

It might be a rather unique spot for foreigners, but it's okay for Chinese people. They sell Nagasaki specialties like "kakuni" buns, long plate udon, "kyoubo" noodles, and soup dumplings... However, I wasn't very hungry at the time, so I just strolled through and left.

I continued walking towards Glover Garden and passed by the Confucius Temple XD

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*vsjibVbJQUSDQFfiwdEbIw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*eN25xDjrhsFLYIax1QagEg.jpeg)

I passed through Dutch Slope (which is just a slope) and then took the escalator up to Entrance 2 of Glover Garden. The entire terrain is a hillside facing the sea.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Zmdc7_8w8_tnGZaumArXdQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*GjHniudZCGHSrhQ2Kn-L_w.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*vp_ePOP7s4FFCn26N540wQ.jpeg)

Entering Glover Garden, I took a quick look at the architectural styles and interior decorations; it resembles Fort San Domingo in Tamsui (since both were established by the Dutch).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Bu3xUvR49gK2mnHopeVUGA.jpeg)

Lastly, don't forget to exchange for a free photo, from which you can also overlook the cruise ships in Nagasaki Port.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*_rbT_Tpd_jmkVEdUCdogTA.jpeg)

On the way down, I passed by the Oura Catholic Church. I didn't go inside, just took a photo and left.

I bought a Nagasaki kakuni bun to try, but I think the ones in Taiwan are better!

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*GaT9e4OG9q1Wo0fcXf4dng.jpeg)



On the way back north to the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum, we first got off at the Megane Bridge to take photos. The reflection in the water from the front view is really quite beautiful, and it's worth a shot if you have time.
#### Nagasaki (North)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*SNDwEmMdLUnw8Yy7yDq4XA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*N9M1TVKf-6wF6h8T7KhXnQ.jpeg)

Visiting the Atomic Bomb Museum, the overall feeling is one of immersion and reflection. The venue has designed many scenes (from the time of the explosion or immersive installations), art installations, historical materials, and interviews; allowing visitors to immerse themselves in the historical atmosphere of that time and reflect on the cruelty and horror of future wars.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*IHy4429UVvl_Ai4s6J-YZw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*4r2bAjoFadw8YSvOjwbH_w.jpeg)

After leaving the museum, walking straight ahead is the atomic bomb explosion point, Peace Park.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*3NltbSXG6tUGgjOFIzE9gw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*c11oO0Qx_DgLEx3I-8m_4A.jpeg)

Along the way (including the Atomic Bomb Museum), many colorful paper cranes are hung up as a symbol of the prayer for peace.
#### **Inasayama Night View**

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*tgN1b_oj4mFRPnGD_NJJrA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*hXfIlA4TtnrFHcI1IG55ZA.jpeg)

After leaving Peace Park, we first went to Komeda for a short rest, preparing to see the **Inasayama night view, one of the three great night views in the world.**

After checking the bus schedule, we walked a short distance from Komeda to a bus stop that goes to the base of the Inasayama cable car (Enoshima Station), and then strolled to the station to wait for the bus.

As a result, we were caught off guard by the bus delay; this small station doesn't have an electronic display board, and Google Maps indicated the bus had left the station, but we didn't see it; after waiting for more than 5 minutes, I thought maybe there wouldn't be any buses today, so I quickly checked for other nearby stops that go to Enoshima, and then walked another 10 minutes to another stop to catch a different bus.

> The funny thing is that halfway there, I saw the delayed bus arrive... but it was too late Orz

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*vZGtQE4euYrwu5i8bxZT0g.jpeg)

After getting off, right across is Enoshima Shrine. We walked straight up, passing through a kindergarten, and then we reached the Nagasaki cable car (Enoshima Station). Since we didn't plan to stay too late, we bought a round-trip ticket (which is cheaper, but if you stay too late, there won't be any cable cars, and you'll have to take a bus back).

[![Nagasaki Cable Car 2023/09](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/43a3_hqdefault.jpg "Nagasaki Cable Car 2023/09")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzLj8Rn4ivU){:target="_blank"}

It was a bit like Wulai -> Unzen Resort's Fu.

After getting off the cable car, there is another sightseeing cable car you can take, but I didn't try it, so I just walked straight towards the observation deck.

[![Inasayama Observation Deck 2023/09](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/a74f_hqdefault.jpg "Inasayama Observation Deck 2023/09")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tCSsd_56ug){:target="_blank"}

I forgot to take a photo of the observation deck; it's a 360-degree tower where you can see the entire Nagasaki city area, the port, and the mountains, and there is no admission fee; you can start watching from the west as the sun sets over the port to the east for the night view of the city.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ycWNGvWsqoS6ROfArtxV-A.jpeg)

The observation deck is quite large, so there's no worry about crowds.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*pt48qVqxvITyyeINh_FYvg.jpeg)

After sunset, you can see the entire Nagasaki city area and the station's night view, which is very beautiful.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*h8VaTQr7FlA0nhg6ch7hCQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Kkcs8UwsaDpHuHs1mORa5g.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Pvrc0k6RBDoYPQvTGbcF6g.jpeg)

Finally, take a last look at the night view of Nagasaki Station and buy a Nagasaki cake as a souvenir (later found out it’s also sold in Hakata, with a shelf life of about 12 days, so it should be fine to buy it later...), preparing to head back to Hakata.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*RQy2FNuUku35rcCgb59qHw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*meR_ji4M4iPwwGOTYLOQGQ.jpeg)

Encountered another delay, this time with JR (signal failure); it was delayed for almost an hour before arriving in Hakata (exhausted), and the driver was driving quite fast, making it feel a bit shaky.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*sSHNwn8zYwS6gcGbdXFGvg.jpeg)

Bought some late-night snacks and returned to the hotel to rest.

### Day 2 Yanagawa and Dazaifu Day Trip + LalaPort Fukuoka

In the morning, first went to the Fukuoka (Tenjin) Tourist Center to buy a one-day pass ([Fukuoka Tenjin, Yakuin, or online purchase available](http://www.ensen24.jp/kippu/tc/dazaifu-yanagawa/){:target="_blank"}), you can calculate if it’s cheaper.

> [_KKday 【Kyushu Tickets】 Dazaifu Yanagawa Tour Package (Pick up at Taoyuan Airport)_](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/21437-japan-kyushu-tickets-dazaifu-yanagawa-tour-package-taoyuan-airport-pickup?cid=19365&ud1=d78e0b15a08a){:target="_blank"}

[Nishitetsu — One-day tour of the ancient capital Dazaifu and the water town Yanagawa.](http://www.ensen24.jp/kippu/tc/dazaifu-yanagawa/){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*tNAv-ztUglTYs9BZ03SvSA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*EYq5MxPjRuJdXt0hVofBEQ.jpeg)

Additionally, you will receive two coupon books, **one for Dazaifu includes a voucher for a free umekawashi (plum rice cake)**.

There’s no specific order, but the boat ride has a time limit, and it’s not available after 2 PM; so we just followed the itinerary: Fukuoka -> Yanagawa -> Dazaifu -> Fukuoka.

After buying the tickets, go to the manual ticket window, show the staff your ticket, and you can enter the station directly to board the train (no seat reservation needed) to Yanagawa.

**Travel time: about 1 hour and 10 minutes**
#### Yanagawa Boat Ride

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*UlWumJgWsyi7QftJDbr78g.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*mTGFMm5RQGhLbLZkGN13Wg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*hSQUTKmOmOrupH0xRp3dmg.jpeg)

After exiting the station, you will see staff in white vests (if there’s no service center nearby, you can ask them) who will give you a map + return instructions + timetable and guide you to the shuttle bus to the boarding area.

You will also go through the manual ticket check, and the staff will tear off the ticket from Fukuoka to Yanagawa.

Initially, I thought I could walk based on the route, but upon exiting, I saw staff guiding everyone, so I fortunately took the bus.

When arriving at the boarding area and waiting for the next boat, I happened to meet a family from Taiwan traveling together, so I joined them and chatted along the way (after all, I was traveling alone and didn’t speak Japanese XD, I hardly talked to anyone in Kyushu).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*EYClyErNOM44PqOKIboE2A.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*V4WYusauBeyW734TU2-GnQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*yFZMXWoaQAgjvmmGNQMqMA.jpeg)

The water is very clean; during this season, it’s not as beautiful with the lush greenery, but there are relatively fewer people.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*lkMz97RFZuHfYKSqcDNVKQ.jpeg)

The boatman will introduce the sights along the way and sing songs (most Taiwanese would have heard them, many old songs).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*y7eBDIYyOC9ukc976EPBhA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*FoQ4C7vtGV2vS3fYL1df8Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*KVdn-gO4LkKe4BUaVNY9Xw.jpeg)

When crossing the bridge, the boatman asks everyone to lower their heads to avoid collisions, which is quite interesting; there isn't much shade along the way, so it gets a bit sunny.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*MuA9m0apTy9YM_Za4gPXoA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*j4EsiAPOto1nTJaoy2wCsw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*IbqgTkCF6KbqmdNfTE31MQ.jpeg)

In the middle, we pass by an ice shop that sells fruit ice, where you can buy one to cool off; the boatman also hands out ice packs to help everyone cool down (very thoughtful).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*MS8uJsLk7oQIqc3wMEPijw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*oem9fbgUykeVyEQbxathQA.png)

I chatted with the father of a Taiwanese family in front of us, and in the end, I even received a business card.

After getting off the boat, I couldn't find a seat on the free shuttle bus and ended up in the wrong line, getting rejected from another (non-Western Railway package) shuttle bus; I need to study the boarding points on the map (Chuanliu Boat Dock (Okinoshita)) or ask directly for a quicker solution.

I later walked to catch a bus back to Nishitetsu Yanagawa Station.

#### Dazaifu

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*CaTfG56LYBguxdMhJJz1sg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*P-KvZh9Eksj9nJ8dA2QWDg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*EV3vuJEGjlMKocB-RmG0Pg.jpeg)

To get from Yanagawa to Dazaifu, you need to transfer at Nishitetsu Futsukaichi Station to a train heading to Dazaifu (you have to go to another platform).

**Travel time: about 1 hour**

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*PpKs_TM4aa71gThwa-XBeg.png)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*piNmkE4dzUWnbjr4UuRqBg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*You2qpKtRydrco2vGB1MOA.jpeg)

Taking the Traveler train to Dazaifu, passing through Gojō (2.5 lines of Wu QQ); it's somewhat similar to the route from Beitou to Xinbeitou, with just one train going back and forth.

There is a train car in the middle that displays artifacts from Dazaifu and allows you to write postcards, which is worth checking out.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*8H_Fg7aRMhS51IW92Tq4Sg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*pTTWzqPljA7XTAxc66iwgg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*3Ya_TWp3Um9FO1AGiAnUag.jpeg)

Dazaifu Station is also beautiful, and the Lawson outside has a very Japanese feel.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Fy3bL_xW3WcWkhnHN8wHJA.jpeg)

To the right after exiting the station is the world's only pentagon (Japanese qualified) Ichiran ramen.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*jAg-p4pWUmGZTBB_GzscOA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*4shsKlSI5a8sH_kZOSVWrw.jpeg)

After eating ramen, I had a Umegae-mochi, which isn't very related to plums; it's more like red bean grilled rice cake. You have to eat the freshly made skin to enjoy it; it's delicious!

I forgot to use the exchange voucher that came with the Nishitetsu package and ended up spending 150 yen to buy one myself; I saw that the shelf life was only one day, so I couldn't bring it back to Taiwan.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*03FKPTOUM3ixyGJH6q84vQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*srmvCC9_m6VqzyzClIl7Vg.jpeg)

Continuing along Omotesando towards Dazaifu, you will pass one of the most beautiful Starbucks in Japan. The space is quite large, but there are many people, so I left without stopping.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*TSuNOEiB5p3iKiwSsobnbw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*rn3LBP5JoyXGyIlSrc96Kw.jpeg)

The bridge leading to the shrine would be great for photos at night with fewer people; it was too crowded to take decent shots.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*i-5T__GVT98BKIIYr-MY9g.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*GZgD39SPXkmdOoZP-hQI0A.png)

After visiting, return to Dazaifu Station and head back to Fukuoka Lalaport.
#### Fukuoka Lalaport

First, return to Nishitetsu Futsukaichi Station from Dazaifu Station, then transfer to a train heading towards Hakata. Get off at Ohashi (Fukuoka), exit to the left towards the bus stop, and find the direct bus to Lalaport. It takes just one stop to reach Fukuoka Lalaport.

**Total travel time: approximately 50 minutes**

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*bX9Z6aTpmzZ6Fx1XrPM09A.jpeg)

Upon arrival, you will see the giant Gundam outside.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*_6ENxMHmrrX0qQBScWXGBw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*B70QuI9XspRVyJFX4yyjug.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*NdikFoZkjqp5PjCtv4udEA.jpeg)

Lalaport is large, easy to explore, and suitable for families; there is a big playground upstairs where children are playing and some people are resting.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*5iYK2l03UU9ukNYzXy1CDA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*3d9MLxuds5AVFnPTRVzi4A.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*uDEx5fHs8B_PqP-r52Jopw.jpeg)

Upstairs, there is a Jump Shop selling merchandise related to Shonen Jump Weekly, including Haikyuu, One Piece, Hunter x Hunter, Jujutsu Kaisen, Chainsaw Man, etc. I bought some Jujutsu merchandise.

You can get a tax refund for purchases over 5000 yen, but it seems to be refunded to their app or something, which is a bit complicated, and food is not included.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Y-TGFdRWA68x7hQRX-ehIg.png)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*OV9vZbnrr4hAdm8R8PmDAQ.jpeg)

I went to the food court to eat Miyazaki beef bowl and bought some snacks to take back (curry bread, Mizuan Daifuku).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*pUUNxUKS1d7wxq7JAYdZoQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*f-KaaW1uJgbGGkW1qW3Pvg.jpeg)

The glowing Gundam at night is quite impressive.

**For the return trip, the direct bus does not depart from the original drop-off point; just follow the signs inside the building to the bus station.**

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*fnCYg71dDVxOFftZbagc1g.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*CLBqxxhQdFr6SOK5cQ3JUQ.jpeg)

Return to the hotel to rest, using my own tablet (the TV is too old and lacks smart features); the curry bread is crispy and delicious, with meat filling inside, and the daifuku is not bad, but I prefer the one from [Benzaiten](../7b8a0563c157/).
### Day 3 Mojiko, Kokura Castle, Canal City Hakata, Nakasu Yatai

In the morning, head to Hakata Station first, take the JR train to Mojiko, and then return to Kokura Castle.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*xnP4BV7BopjaW0i7P6MeLg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*z_Js8q61ur3RH--blv7rlg.jpeg)

![[Hakata Kokura Transportation](https://www.bobblog.tw/fukuoka-to-kokura-transport/){:target="_blank"}](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*6OcPE4rlWM7NvVKr5BxHsg.jpeg)

[Hakata Kokura Transportation](https://www.bobblog.tw/fukuoka-to-kokura-transport/){:target="_blank"}

**A little incident**  
I didn't check Google Maps for planning and ended up taking the **Shinkansen Nozomi 20**, which is not covered by the JR Pass; when exiting, I was stuck and had to pay an additional 2,160 yen with the help of the station staff to complete the exit. However, it was indeed fast, reaching Mojiko in just 15 minutes.
#### Mojiko

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*RJ6qovuNTjbt6n7icFUoAw.jpeg)

I arrived at Mojiko without any issues (I was worried about being fined).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*nV-GJFPB66WA5_iSfcj6pA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*3TjVqygHlIbVgLOdi5K0RQ.jpeg)



Walking straight out of the station leads to Mojiko, which is completely deserted on regular days; I happened to catch the blue-winged Mojiko Bridge being lowered.


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ngbx4pRfKIz6rkSxLuL1Vw.jpeg)



![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*j53FUw7WrYh_mCyrJjd2HQ.jpeg)



![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*gK1xI52WIn1zqyo0Utaj0g.jpeg)


After it was lowered, I walked back to the observation tower behind, where I could overlook the entire Mojiko.


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*wAol04X1j8u7wmxHyzE0Dw.jpeg)



![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Kf4JiBvJTgP2Myd9eISkhA.jpeg)


After exiting the tower, I took a stroll around Mojiko.


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*0EvlQ9tL_CKmgXte8KHe9A.jpeg)


For lunch, I had the famous curry buns from Mojiko.
#### Kokura Castle


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*GmRYm-lN6hvJK7YfEpiRNA.jpeg)



![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*X8-UceEKo95-ijfsIiZjpg.jpeg)


Mojiko is very close to Kokura, but Kokura is a small station. Upon exiting, it was desolate, and I took a wrong turn looking for the entrance to Kokura, which is actually on the side of the mall outside Kokura.


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*28ZceWYL5Ow97LC2DFJqpg.jpeg)



![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*htqg9n9A0aO9pVKtt2fY4Q.jpeg)



![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Q_mOgGt8Jx0AhTOozw9irQ.jpeg)


Kokura Castle is small, but there are quite a few exhibits inside; however, the view from the main keep is quite ordinary (the mall is right in front).


After visiting, I returned to the station to take the train back to Hakata, obediently taking the JR line, but the small station only had local trains, which took over an hour to return slowly.
#### Canal City Hakata

Since it was still early when I got back to Hakata, I decided to stroll around Canal City Hakata and the city center.


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*OH4UyxesQ_dSXGbNDv1v1A.jpeg)



![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*QeiwPfHkElqJuf9zb4klJA.jpeg)


I didn't check much beforehand; I originally thought it was some kind of "castle" or "moat," but it turned out to be a department store XD. There is indeed a "moat" and a water fountain show.


There are many shops to browse here, including a Jump Shop.


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*r1ZoKETxNEu7zFn_Wx1UKA.jpeg)



![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*uucc02nUO6ED-eRZ5te7Bw.jpeg)



![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*TUlyy9j9SS1TgOU1LPilLg.jpeg)


It was still early, so I wandered around and went out to eat [Hakata Gion Teppanyaki Dumplings](https://www.google.com.tw/maps/place/%E5%8D%9A%E5%A4%9A+%E7%A5%87%E5%9C%92+%E9%90%B5%E9%8D%8B%E7%85%8E%E9%A4%83/@33.592549,130.3956236,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x354191c08e1f8ba5:0x2fab929d0965c092!8m2!3d33.5925325!4d130.4140561!16s%2Fg%2F11b6_mwx3l?entry=ttu){:target="_blank"}.

The skin is crispy and flaky, with soup inside, very delicious; due to the language barrier, the shop assistant was cute and gestured to indicate two portions (one portion only has 8 pieces, and 2 portions with 16 pieces would be enough). At that time, I didn't quite understand, so I only ordered one portion plus the famous Hakata Mentai.


#### Nakasu Yatai


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*dHDTL5F-aENFvtdjit2ANg.jpeg)



![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ho7cWp4ftznokbLjiAmINQ.jpeg)


After eating, it was still light out, so I took a leisurely stroll around Nakasu Yatai.

Since it was still early, I headed to Tenjin's department store (Parco) to browse until it got dark before returning to see the night view.


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*JlcHaZzHUPY8bwqhRjO2Ug.jpeg)



![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*yKaM_zDlN8D9O9gImt50VA.jpeg)


Upstairs, there is Animate, and I got a gacha pull that landed on Gojo Satoru. 


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Z8DS13esrRB4_qiXvF_cUQ.jpeg)

```markdown
![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*cxbTK3KovZ7DfV6H9WfpPA.jpeg)

The night view of Nakasu Yatai gives a sense of liveliness.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*GBUmAZZUxV-4UR5RMq64zg.jpeg)

The extravagant and eye-catching Japanese advertisement sign.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*M9--SjBUn9MMPqISM6T6sQ.png)

Nakasu Yatai is a roadside eatery on this side, bustling with people; there are ramen, oden, and barbecue, but nothing particularly appealing, so I didn't go in to eat.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*f2ZJWpaaDzMJ6rqHGFDgVA.jpeg)

Back to the hotel for drinks and a late-night snack to rest.
### Day 4 Sumiyoshi Shrine, Kushida Shrine, Tenjin Underground Shopping Street, Fukuoka Tower, Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks Baseball Game

A day of walking in Fukuoka, after leaving the hotel, I first walked to the nearby Sumiyoshi Shrine.
#### Sumiyoshi Shrine

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*nbwbkzRIdaCmUVvHuNAMCA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*wfWT4fMn18bOYXRvtZv2EA.jpeg)

It's small, and I wouldn't specifically visit if I weren't nearby.

I passed by Canal City Hakata again on my way to Kushida Shrine.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*0J4R0Uw9-EiJtlqEb_qDrg.jpeg)

On the way, I saw the small and cute place where the yatai food trucks park in the morning.
#### Kushida Shrine

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*AKMxSha93q8rrBb1iCVSmw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*GQUibdqPaaNc7VIxIUOoQQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ueZwF6ubMD4QWKxJbeEj9w.jpeg)

Kushida Shrine is relatively large, and I drew a fortune, which said that job hunting "will suddenly succeed," giving me hope for work.

There is a display of the Hakata Gion Yamakasa floats, which are huge and spectacular.

Continuing to stroll through Fukuoka, I walked to [ハカタミヤチク \(日本一宮崎牛専門店 博多みやちく\)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FomFZet8BhoBpU4a7){:target="_blank"} to taste Miyazaki beef.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*jt_0agA4sSc_YjcqZUKonw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*wc4yEWG8xEPPfRKXTa5gHg.jpeg)

This serving of Miyazaki beef steak plus beer costs about TWD $650, delicious and affordable! The Miyazaki beef juice has no strange odor.
#### Tenjin Underground Shopping Street

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*PJW3exeffBFjmRQyE4uj5A.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*EV5Pat2lj6ecjr0DTs-ytg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*SYNvszV8kvn8rkVAfZWbGA.jpeg)

After lunch, I wandered around Tenjin and the Tenjin Underground Shopping Street, buying some souvenirs like chicken-shaped cookies and cakes; I also bought some popular muscat grapes at the supermarket to try.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*KFwkPsRb4-rOVK3k0K23vQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*CA1FUs6HspHBDkhCMzIONA.jpeg)

While wandering in Tenjin, I discovered a wild Kumamon mascot.

After returning to the hotel to drop off the souvenirs and rest for a moment, I set off for Fukuoka Tower and the baseball game.
#### Fukuoka Tower

I took a bus from the city center to Fukuoka Tower.

Fukuoka Tower features a full mirror design, which looks beautiful from the outside. I think it's even more beautiful than the Tokyo Skytree!

(Thanks to the passerby sister for taking the photo)

However, since the tower is located on the outskirts of the city by the sea, the view from the top is mediocre; I'm not sure how the night view looks.

After leaving Fukuoka Tower, I slowly walked to the next stop, which is Fukuoka PayPay Baseball Stadium, where you can smell the sea.
#### Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks Baseball Game

There were a lot of people (about 70% full), but there were still tickets available for purchase on-site.

**Ticket Purchase Anecdote**

When I was buying tickets, I encountered an elderly man at the counter who seemed nervous and was shaking his hands when he saw a foreigner and couldn't communicate; I felt nervous too XD. In a moment of brain fog, I chose the last row in the middle of the designated seating area in the front section (with people sitting on both sides), which turned out to be super awkward. I had to keep saying すみません while entering and exiting, and the seats were small, squeezed in among the Japanese people. I couldn't speak a word of Japanese, which was very awkward... I sat upright and watched the entire game seriously.

The ticket price was nearly 1,500 TWD, and I thought I should have just bought the cheapest bad seat to enjoy the game comfortably.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*h17D9q0ifuOferUBpK2zyA.jpeg)


I must say the visual effects in the dome (very close to the field) and the large screen animations were excellent.


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*rtd4JAmPhxcUFEXQDcMK5w.jpeg)


The cheering tradition of the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks involves everyone inflating balloons (using a manual pump) in the 7th inning and then releasing them. As for the trash... well, someone will clean it up later.


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*pU0cI1jbDXEc8olmBD8jHg.jpeg)


In the end, the home team won 4:2. It was more exciting than the CPBL, with pitchers throwing at speeds around 145 km/h, and there was action in every inning; very few three-up, three-down innings. The pace of the game was also very fast, making it enjoyable to watch.

However, the cheerleading aspect is still richer in Taiwan than in Japan.

When the home team wins, fireworks are set off inside the dome, which is very cool!!

I bought a SoftBank Hawks towel as a souvenir from my visit, which also resolved the [embarrassment of not being able to enter the Hanshin Tigers Koshien Stadium due to sold-out tickets last time](../76d66c2e34af/).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*By0Fpq90NNlZunTLJ-NKcw.jpeg)


There were a lot of people leaving the stadium, but everyone kept their distance and walked slowly. I followed the crowd to the nearest subway station, Chinatown Station, because it felt like the bus line would take a long time to get through.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*8gMp6Bl5FvxKpxk7B8B1Tg.jpeg)


Back at the hotel to rest, I also tried the seedless muscat grapes I bought in the afternoon. They were very sweet, almost too sweet.
### Day 5 Kumamoto (Kumamoto Castle, Tsuruya Department Store)

Early in the morning, I checked out and strolled around the pharmacy near the hotel.


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*IKO7DuRGXWppSx4kjEa-uw.png)


I found not much, so I had a McDonald's meal (a McMuffin with egg and an iced Americano for just $107) before returning to pick up my luggage and prepare to take the JR to Kumamoto.


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*2lHuQh01LN9fd4uLAbnxLw.jpeg)



![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*3VYUkk7Bn3aDiFzFiaqY9g.jpeg)

Finally, it's time to say goodbye to this hotel. The lobby has plush toys of the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, and outside, there's a 🇹🇼 flag hanging, which is quite impressive since next door is a convenience store run by Chinese people, with many Chinese customers.

#### Fukuoka Hakata -> Kumamoto

I used the station's electronic machine to reserve a seat, thinking it might be a bit far, and carrying luggage, it's better to book a seat.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*m8MKMTpBRE_yI5ozboJG7g.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*sijQ_PWnzsDdmvtvw3jQvg.png)

Following the instructions to reserve a seat, basically:
1. First select the language, first select the language, first select the language (otherwise, you can't change it after inserting the ticket card; you have to exit and start over)
2. Insert the JR Pass ticket card
3. Select departure and arrival stations (search using English station names)
4. Choose the train and seat
5. Done

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*qR-5AlK9DCY6L15sB8tpKQ.jpeg)

If you have any questions, there are station staff available to ask. Originally, there was a train departing in 15 minutes with no available seats, so I could only buy a ticket for another train 45 minutes later.

However, it turned out to be a good thing I didn't buy that train. Walking from Hakata Station to the Shinkansen platform heading to Tsushima (via Kumamoto) takes about 10 minutes, and it’s a bit of a detour, so I was pressed for time.

I made sure to use my JR Pass on its last day before it expired.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*CAbsu55A7IG0XZ_hlcbHkg.jpeg)

> I was initially worried that my [27-inch suitcase](https://tw.eminent.com/?route=product/product&product_id=362&color=240&size=27){:target="_blank"} (approximately 69 x 50 x 29 cm) wouldn't fit in the overhead compartment and that I would have to buy [an extra-large luggage seat, which requires a total dimension of over 160 cm](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/tc/howto/baggage/){:target="_blank"}.

> A 27-inch suitcase can be a bit cramped and might block the neighboring seat; in practice, it fits quite securely in the luggage rack, but I still had to lift it up. Choosing a window seat made it tricky when putting away my luggage, as I was worried about blocking passengers in the aisle. Fortunately, I encountered a kind Japanese gentleman who offered to let me take his seat to store my luggage.

Upon arriving in Kumamoto, I immediately saw the giant Kumamon. I first took the JR and subway to the hotel to drop off my luggage (at the Civic Sports Center Station).

Kumamoto is filled with Kumamon everywhere...

### 2024–11–16 Update: ⚠️⚠️

[Public transportation in Kumamoto Prefecture: **Kyushu Sanko Bus, Sanko Bus, Kumamoto Bus, Kumamoto City Bus, and Kumamoto Electric Railway** no longer accepts payment for fares using transportation IC cards like Suica, PASMO, ICOCA, etc.](https://udn.com/news/story/6812/8364511){:target="_blank"} Currently, only cash is accepted, and credit card payments may be introduced in the future, so please be aware. ⚠️⚠️⚠️

#### Kumamoto Castle

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*jJ-spM14lTmb2ywUMFln6g.jpeg)

After dropping off my luggage at the hotel, I took the tram to Kumamoto Castle (to the Tsumachi Station).

You can first visit the **Sakura no Baba Josaien (I forgot to take a photo)** to stroll around and recharge. You can purchase tickets for Kumamoto Castle here; there aren't many people, and when you go up to the entrance of Kumamoto Castle, you might encounter a large group.

Ticket options include: Kumamoto Castle 800, Kumamoto Castle + the building behind it (Historical and Cultural Experience Yuyuyuzō) 850, Kumamoto Castle + the building behind it (Historical and Cultural Experience Yuyuyuzō) + Kumamoto Museum 1,100.

I bought the Kumamoto Castle + Yuyuyuzō ticket, thinking it was only an additional 50 yen, but after exploring, I found it to be average. I did get to see the exhibitions related to Kumamoto Castle and earthquake artifacts, which were suitable for photography experiences.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Dibx_A0cDQxg60IpxfE24A.jpeg)

The main keep of Kumamoto Castle has been restored and reopened in 2023, while other buildings are still under repair (you can see cranes).

The new design includes a sky walkway that leads directly to Kumamoto Castle.

Next to the plaza, the souvenir shop has a collection of Kumamoto Castle models, completing my mission to collect the three great castles!

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*UCWV45ZU_7T94bkck15YzA.jpeg)

I returned to the ticket purchase area to visit the Yuyukan; inside, there are models of Kumamoto Castle and a LEGO version of Kumamoto Castle, which is very cool.

Due to the unfavorable weather, I didn't take the detour to the museum or Kato Shrine.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Oef--KK1LHNMa03Dl0XOyQ.jpeg)

I walked back to the Tōmachi-suji Station, where the Kamitori Shopping Street and the local Tsuruya Department Store are located. The first floor of the east building of the department store has the newly renovated Kumamon Plaza (Kumamon's office) that just opened a few months ago.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*RuqRF-Cd6DIOUTxqrQ9YEw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*4ujIu_abHz71ELI9DhF-cw.jpeg)

While wandering around the shopping street, I happened to encounter a public event featuring Kumamon and traffic safety, where I received a Kumamon tote bag.

This whole area isn't very interesting; it's quite boring. Only the Tsutaya bookstore and the MUJI building are relatively enjoyable. Upon arriving in Kumamoto, you can immediately feel that there are many elderly people and very few young people. The local Tsuruya Department Store is mostly frequented by older adults, selling women's clothing and home goods, with fewer items for younger people.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*rcNcYdUqN8Gtj2MzyLK-FA.jpeg)

I bought some Kumamon merchandise (more styles than at Kumamon Plaza) at the Kumamon shop in Tsuruya Department Store, then went to the basement shopping area to buy alcohol and food (dinner + late-night snack) to take back to the hotel.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ZHqf7zyxC9AfOFlZDVozpQ.jpeg)

Kōro is a local Kumamoto sake recommended by the store; it's sweet and smooth to drink, but I feel it lacks a strong rice flavor.  
[Green Rich Hotel Suizenji 2023/09](https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F2y_kNs6patA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D2y_kNs6patA&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube){:target="_blank"}

It's worth mentioning the hotel; I usually don't pay much attention to reviews; I just look for places with around 3 stars or more. However, this hotel's sound insulation is poor, and I happened to encounter a whole floor full of elementary school graduation trips, with doors slamming continuously for two days, making a lot of noise.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*4wmL-qX635TygnAySJSKVA.png)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*TTvU7fMU3mYwYBLrvtAVrA.jpeg)

I checked the detailed reviews on Google/Agoda and felt a sense of empathy.

Poor sound insulation seems to be a common issue with older hotels, which I can tolerate (I brought earplugs); however, the hotel's WiFi, as noted in previous reviews, is just a sham.

The WiFi has a signal throughout the hotel, but even with a full signal in the room, the speed is very slow, and I can't even open web pages. I have to be right next to the door for the internet speed to be normal, which is almost equivalent to having no internet at the hotel.
```

> The prices are not very attractive; it would be better to stay in Fukuoka, where the same price can get you a direct APA.
 
> After this experience, I realized that even Japanese hotels should be checked for reviews...

Aside from being conveniently located near the airport, there are no advantages; there are no convenience stores nearby (you have to walk over 10 minutes to find one).
### Day 6 Suizenji Jojuen, Kumamon Square Performance, Hanabata Square, Sakura Town Shopping Center

In the morning, I got up and walked directly to Suizenji Jojuen across the street.

> [_KKday Reference Itinerary: One Day Tour in Kumamoto, Kyushu | Aso Nakadake Volcano, Kusasenri, Kumamoto Castle, Suizenji Jojuen / All-You-Can-Eat Seasonal Fruits | Departing from Fukuoka Hakata (Bilingual: Chinese, English, Japanese)_](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/38965?cid=19365&ud1=d78e0b15a08a){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ADvpUiOgU8tAXE38m8zRmg.jpeg)

It has a bit of the feel of the Lin Family Garden in Banqiao, very clean inside, with clear water, a small Mount Fuji, Suizen Shrine, and very fat koi fish along with cats.
#### Kumamon Square Performance

After walking around, I took the tram to Suidocho to head to Kumamon Square (which I visited yesterday).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*pVjE3Ck2-qu15sDSM8nBjw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*2QFIar4JR7mnFKBM-la8FQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*MUqMaZDdNgJUSPHEA9wCjw.jpeg)

Inside, there are Kumamon merchandise for photo opportunities, and outside there are monitors to see what's happening inside.

Since it was still early before the performance at 11 AM, I went next door to Tsuruya Department Store to grab a bite.

You can refer to the performance schedule on the Kumamon [official website](https://www.kumamon-sq.jp/en/){:target="_blank"} (the times may vary, but there are usually three performances on Saturdays).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*iq3M2rCOgZagsRsEWcJUZg.png)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*wcYJIaNAefO0qhA7zne4Rg.jpeg)

While passing by the first floor of Tsuruya Department Store, I also discovered a sad-looking manager playing the piano.

I went to B1 to eat the locally famous honey buns, which are thick-filled wheel cakes with white bean and red bean fillings. Those who love sweets will adore them, and paired with coffee, it makes for a great breakfast.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*eLv_CbVF-poH9TEMZnCb9g.png)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*CgUVnYiFpygQFoxwzDXOlA.png)

Around 11 AM, I returned to Kumamon Square to wait for the performance. Now, there’s no need for a lottery; you can enter as long as you arrive before the performance starts. If you arrive late, you’ll have to watch from outside on the monitor. If you have children, you can sit inside.

Before the performance, they will explain the rules of order, such as: no hitting Kumamon, no taking photos above head level (to avoid blocking those behind), and according to Japanese law, faces must be blurred if shown, and everyone is welcome to upload to SNS.

[![かモン！くまモン！【公式】](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/41a2_hqdefault.jpg "かモン！くまモン！【公式】")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vnhzcxl9E4){:target="_blank"}

The performance lasts about 30 minutes, with the host sister helping Kumamon speak (in all Japanese). The flow generally includes greeting everyone, sharing interesting facts about Kumamoto, dancing (to the catchy song above), and saying hi to people from different countries. (There were a lot of Taiwanese people in this performance XD).

Kumamon is very cute, with big movements and is very entertaining.

The merchandise sold inside the square is actually limited and priced high, so I didn’t buy anything there.

After watching the performance, it was close to noon, so I walked down the shopping street to eat at [Sheng Lie Ting Xin Shi Jie Ben Dian](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LFjoSMqAAKokpQ7x7){:target="_blank"}; as I walked outside the shopping street, I instantly upgraded from a children's level to a restricted level, with a whole row of free information centers (the other side, Kumamoto Ginza Street, also has them).

The super thick Jucie pork cutlet rice is special because it comes with their pickled vegetables (shared, self-serve, remember to use the red chopsticks). Everything else is the same as eating Japanese pork cutlet in Taiwan, with a grinding stick and sesame provided for making the sauce; rice, tea, soup, and cabbage are all free to refill; I ate two bowls of white rice in one go and felt very satisfied.

#### Hanabatake Square

After eating and drinking enough, I continued walking down the shopping street towards Hanabatake Square.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*xxyLvJbgFbTwyvbEE-03SQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*vMfcfDDw4UeF6GlWSMEidA.jpeg)

I happened to encounter an event at the square on Saturday, the Food Summit 2003, with food stalls all around and a stage set up in the middle for performances.

I bought a cup of sparkling wine and a grilled sausage, sat down to watch the performance, but the grilled sausage wasn't as fragrant and delicious as those in Taiwan.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*aB7AGxcyyOk0Bux_kGOE_Q.png)

Halfway through eating, something fell from the stage, which was a bit scary, but it was very immersive; later, it got too hot, so I left after finishing my meal and went to the Sakura Town Shopping Center to browse the department store.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*4JL4q8VJD8hjRD9V_1yUgA.jpeg)

At Hanabatake Square, it feels like there are events every weekend, so you can check in advance; next week is the Taiwan Festival!

#### Sakura Town Shopping Center

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*gYwyLO5uIgukaUxrw9EWBQ.png)

On the top floor, there is a Kumamoto bear waving, and the second floor also sells Kumamoto bear merchandise ( **I think it's the most complete** ).

You can walk up the outside stairs to the top floor to find the waving Kumamoto bear. This building also houses the Kumamoto Bus Center, where you can buy tickets on the second floor to travel to other cities.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*f-f2HnZHXygams-VMOK_rA.jpeg)

You can also take the escalator from inside; from the third floor's Shushiyuan (this Shushiyuan had no customers at all), you can find the escalator leading up.

> Personally, I think Sakura Town Shopping Center is newer and more enjoyable than Tsuruya Department Store.

Next to the Sakura Town Shopping Center is the Kumamoto Prefectural Product Hall, which not only has Kumamoto's specialties but also some Kumamoto bear merchandise (for example: Kumamoto bear incense burner XD).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*2I1wloHndXebjUNrnhTjEQ.jpeg)

On the way back, I walked through the shopping street again.
```


I bought clothes and miscellaneous items at Muji, and replenished my cosmetics at Matsumoto Kiyoshi (I don't know why my Visa card doesn't work at Matsumoto Kiyoshi; it was declined in Tokyo before, and this time it was the same in Kumamoto, so I had to sacrifice some yen cash).

By the time I arrived at the hotel, it was close to evening, so I casually solved dinner at a Lawson on the way and went to bed early to prepare for tomorrow's trip to Mount Aso!

What was special along the way was that when entering the Aso volcano area, the bus introduced the Aso volcano and played local mountain songs, inviting you to imagine the feeling of strolling through the Aso volcanic grasslands.

Upon arriving at Aso Station, there is a statue of [Usopp from One Piece](https://www.nipponsensor.net/hotspots/kyushu/kumamoto/16623/){:target="_blank"} outside the station for photo opportunities (I forgot to take a picture).

You can buy a one-day pass for Mount Aso at the vending machine here (which is about a few hundred yen cheaper) and get a timetable. The one-day pass is only valid for getting on and off at the three stations listed on the timetable, and you need to draw a numbered ticket to board; it seems that other stations cannot be used.

I will take route 8, the bus to the mountain at 10:45.

**Travel time to the mountain: about 40 minutes.**

There weren't many people, and as the time approached, we lined up a bit and got on the bus. Everyone seemed to have boarded; however, due to safety considerations on mountain roads, there were no standing spots; also, those who are prone to motion sickness should take motion sickness medication.

Aso also has a helicopter experience tour, where you can take a helicopter to see the volcano; those interested can check it out.
#### Mount Aso

![Kami\-komezuka](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*rLrgMZZxclLg8e8ivamkgA.jpeg)

Kami\-komezuka

On the way up the mountain, we first passed Kusasenri before reaching the mountain's main station. From the main station, we would change buses again, and it would take about 10 minutes to reach the volcanic crater at the top.

I happened to meet a fellow traveler from TSMC who was also traveling alone (here on a business trip XD) and was also visiting Aso for the first time, so we decided to team up for the itinerary.

At the mountain's main station, we had to change buses again, but we were too lazy to wait, so we chose to walk up the mountain (about 15–20 minutes).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*sPibzt-cJqGdsHESJDlFHQ.jpeg)

Walking to the mountain plaza, we arrived at the fourth crater of Aso Nakadake.

Having travel companions made taking photos a breeze!

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ZWzO9QxTavrWzY0a-VKVPA.jpeg)



The mountain is cool and not hot at all, filled with the smell of sulfur. If you have the illness shown in Picture 3, consider your physical condition.

Just a quick visit, I didn't reach the crater of Mount Aso, just came up to take a look and then went back down.

**A Little Interlude**

We chatted so happily on the way down that I didn't pay attention to the bus direction. When it was about to depart, I hurriedly got on the bus and ended up being taken back up again, so I had to walk down once more XD.

After arriving at the mountain's main station, this time I clearly saw the bus for Route 8, Route 8, Route 8, heading down to Aso Station; I got off at Kusasenrigahama.
#### Kusasenrigahama

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*zlo-HL77zL6a8qqAAxxL4A.jpeg)


I had the famous おか牛丼 (beef bowl), which was crowded but had plenty of seating, and the food came out quickly, almost no waiting.


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*yO0t_Sc_4KFwzWlkc_0cBg.jpeg)



![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*evCQPMnTNh36KfxYt5df6g.jpeg)


After eating, I walked around Kusasenrigahama (it has a bit of a Kintetsu feel), where there were horse riding experiences available.


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*L88s9FmIbWQf5X2uXnfeRw.jpeg)


After eating, I took the same Route 8 bus back to Aso Station, retracing my steps.
#### Aso Shrine

When I arrived at Aso Station, the JR train to Aso Shrine (Miyaji Station) was about to depart in three minutes. If I missed it, I would have to wait another hour; I rushed into the station and encountered **Aso being a small station without electronic payment**, so I had to buy a ticket, flustered as I completed the purchase at the vending machine and boarded the train.


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*eHZXYwFfSwsyX5aPlg9eAw.jpeg)



> Aso Station has only one platform, so you can just get on without thinking; later I found out that if you're really short on time and can't buy a ticket, you can board directly and pay when you exit. 






![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*F5ILZAsRZmIAkBtQrOsS7A.jpeg)


After exiting Miyaji Station, it takes about another 20 minutes to walk to Aso Shrine (just go straight, but it's a bit far).


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*wd-3d_MGTp5SHb8y1uWrxg.jpeg)



![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*psZQ7-HaTvmpRtLZWdpjMw.jpeg)


On the way, I encountered a wild Kumamon.


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*3-n4vVHSN1xbC--njCSv5Q.jpeg)



![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Wei6wFhutK5dLcBw8uNo0Q.jpeg)


The shrine is not large, and I finished my visit quickly; part of the shrine is also under maintenance.


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*OUXCHM46kLP7dX9wK2V2eQ.jpeg)



![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*r4pVzDUZAgSM1GqncJFtZg.jpeg)


After exiting, there is a small shopping street next to the shrine where you can buy some snacks and take a short break.


> Thanks to the older brother for treating me to fried beef potato cakes. 






![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*fK8cgr4DdYmV_fp227Sgdg.jpeg)



![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*__dthm4EZrm3m0lKXj6Ong.jpeg)


After finishing my shopping, I started to walk back slowly. I originally planned to take the JR train back to Kumamoto at 15:47, but when I got back to Miyaji Station, I found out that that train was fully reserved with no free seating available, so I couldn't board.

Here’s the timetable; please check the schedule in advance; otherwise, you might end up like us, having to wait an hour for the next train at 16:35 back to Kumamoto.


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*hC6lSvcNnCGWUbCsIZ-b0Q.jpeg)



![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*qXuDCbBIT4n1gdil7k1WjQ.jpeg)


Since there was still plenty of time, we walked back and browsed around Matsumoto Kiyoshi on the way. (Actually, it’s quite far, about a 10-minute walk).

Finally, I took one last look at the tranquil Aso.


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*5DGvGVjiPKZ2E5Tsk5DdvA.jpeg)



![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ulXblSszUH_DuixAAq8TdQ.jpeg)



![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Z9af42-__2b8xd0_hp7ptQ.jpeg)


The local train slowly made its way back to Kumamoto, taking about 1 hour and 45 minutes to arrive.


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Iv-OdLjZKnqXAIo4COMzFg.png)


The route has a section that zigzags, and it will reverse direction, but don't worry, you haven't taken the wrong train!
### Kumamoto Station AMU PLAZA KUMAMOTO

Back at Kumamoto Station to bid farewell to my brother, hoping to meet again someday.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*BXcGaSrX2Vk5OwZzRA4Hng.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*lIgHruNpguQ0-xbGbMvjlA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*F7xqsHEKz8B8ndTSjwhdag.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*-6LgKo-WB_drTE4ZeAHE7Q.jpeg)

At Kumamoto Station, I explored the newly opened AMU PLAZA KUMAMOTO department store (larger and more diverse than the Sakura Town Shopping Center) and the nearby Higo Market (selling food).

I also discovered many Kumamon XD.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*4e0sLEIgYSQQMLDEQARecQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*x1fFUVJDyQHNfERM5y2VBA.png)

I casually had dinner at the food street, trying Miyazaki chicken (ordinary), and after exploring the entire building, I bought some late-night snacks and Kumamoto-produced strawberry wine (which was nice after tasting, planning to bring it back to Taiwan) before heading back to the hotel.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*o2wvUot9Lx8hGWPiXVfDwg.jpeg)

There was a rather special store called "BIWAN 美灣" selling Taiwanese products (I saw some Guai Guai XD). I checked and found out it was opened by [Taiwan's Ayu Soap](https://spice.kumanichi.com/outing/spices-iine/126872/){:target="_blank"}.

![[https://kumataiwanlife\.com/](https://kumataiwanlife.com/){:target="_blank"}](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*R6fA_H3d9LiQrlsF0qe17g.png)

[https://kumataiwanlife\.com/](https://kumataiwanlife.com/){:target="_blank"}

While researching, I also found a cool website — [https://kumataiwanlife\.com/](https://kumataiwanlife.com/){:target="_blank"} that has the latest news, events, and fun facts about Kumamoto in Chinese (for example: [Kumamoto's "band-aid" is called "LIBATAPE"](https://kumataiwanlife.com/?p=1350){:target="_blank"}), etc.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*WqIU1mYT_2Dw45oqz0RLQA.jpeg)

Today I discovered that the hotel vending machine actually sells canned draft cola, which I couldn't find in the three major convenience stores.

> It is a collaboration between Suntory and Pepsi, unavailable in Taiwan. It's made using the method for draft beer, resulting in a strong carbonation without the syrupy sweetness. I usually end up discarding regular cola because it gets too sweet, but I could finish the draft cola!

After a satisfying meal, I went to bed early, preparing for the last day in Kumamoto (excluding the day of the return flight).
### Day 9 Wandering and Shopping in Kumamoto

By the third day in Kumamoto, it was actually quite boring. I had already visited all the attractions, so I could only try to find some places to look around and buy some souvenirs and cosmetics.

I originally planned to go to Shimabara City, but the journey was too long (2 hours and 45 minutes one way), and since my JR Pass had already expired, I would have to spend money on long-distance tickets, so I gave up; Oita and Yufuin were also too far, so I gave up; Nan'aso Village, I was too lazy to go and left it for next time; so I just wandered around the city and shopped slowly.
#### Kumamoto Inahoe Shrine

In the morning, I went to Tōmachi Street first to visit the Kumamoto Inahoe Shrine, which I hadn't gone to on the first day.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*dSW4qex51azlo7Xybd1ujA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*qNJWdj8FW6rZhrpzttACLQ.jpeg)

#### Kato Shrine

I walked further to Kato Shrine (it's quite far, about a 20-minute walk, with some uphill paths).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*aox_Wt82SKDfLMar5WOH_Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*JD_NBBMeWKnXiBJSni29lQ.jpeg)

Upon seeing this uphill path, turning in leads to Kato Shrine. You can also see the area that was under repair from the castle tower on the first day, along with many scattered castle walls that need to be restored one by one.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*U1VyNqimZOYqPhcFZiVW3g.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*juF2OXyLTOY8FSQKmwLJSg.jpeg)

It's small, and half of it is still under repair.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*CPy6z2mg4vKSisM50WThog.jpeg)

There is a small fundraising box for the Kumamoto earthquake at Kato Shrine, so I didn't visit the shrine and instead donated to the box.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*bwmOm2Dldn0rLhK6e5Ge5Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*1tkOVIao3N5NYMVp7uvF3w.jpeg)

From here, you can see Kumamoto Castle from the back.

After returning the same way, I headed to Kumamoto City Hall (the 14th floor has a free observation deck). The walk to Kato Shrine is quite far, so you can take the bus.

> I originally planned to visit the Kumamoto Art Museum, the Crafts Museum, etc., but they are all closed on Mondays!

#### Kumamoto City Hall

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*qrtQr_KXzAgXo967gp0JHA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*aqWQ5EBLd8FTytxxHlzUSw.jpeg)

The 14th floor of Kumamoto City Hall offers a panoramic view of the entire Kumamoto area and Kumamoto Castle.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*kIj1wa9QZAnOMOyNXCRdpA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*uOuhkn9mSezuH5BkagqkiA.jpeg)

After leaving the city hall, I walked towards the Sakuramachi Shopping Center and passed by a pedestrian bridge, which is a great spot for photos, where you can capture the Kumamoto streetcar.

This intersection is Kumamoto Ginza Street, which I mentioned a few days ago also has free information centers.

#### Sakuramachi Shopping Center

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*SqQLdgnwXOP0Ng1hvryt2w.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*00xi36Pcc5QEZVvssH-gBQ.jpeg)

I returned to the Sakuramachi Shopping Center to shop and had Miyazaki beef paired with locally brewed beer; before leaving, I bought a Kumamon daifuku to take back to Taiwan as a souvenir (so cute).

#### Don Quijote

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*qpqkxJ3ATYSe8O-FPmqUzQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*IYVcoKjrHAi7z4n4Tj1iXQ.jpeg)

I walked from Shimotori to Kamitori and back to Tōmachi-suji, stopping by Don Quijote to shop (the tax-free counter is on the second floor).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Ve5ggActk-7TuO0d5HmDMg.jpeg)

After shopping, I thought I would head back to the hotel to rest and drop off my things.

**A Little Episode**  
On the streetcar, I encountered some lovely Kumamoto grandparents; they pointed at the transparent bag of duty-free items containing Nissin instant noodles and said, "Sugoi ne~," to which I replied, "Good! Good!" Then I took out the Kumamon daifuku I just bought and said to the grandma, "Kawaii ne~," and she gave me a thumbs up and said, "Kawaii, arigatou." Then I said, "私は台湾人です," and the grandma seemed to greet me (my Japanese is too poor to understand, but I could hear something about being energetic), and I responded politely. When I got off, I also said goodbye to the grandparents.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*rSVRHXrWwE_7MVIQ5zPfBw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*5LeSnaUI3dYrl7LOuhZUcQ.jpeg)

After returning to the hotel, I opened the curtains for the first time, and right behind was the Suizenji River area; the view was actually quite nice, and I could hear the chirping of insects at night.

After resting for a while, I didn't have many places to go in the afternoon, so I just randomly looked for points on the map to wander around.

#### Luffy Statue

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*9HwmY-q4RDpI_mukfBEHZg.jpeg)

I first walked to the front of the Kumamoto Prefectural Office to find the Luffy statue.

#### Kenkun Shrine

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*HDnNjb2OR4op4UHJ35070g.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*I1Um2ql5cFqYYhHtOoccyg.jpeg)

Then I took a bus and walked to Kenkun Shrine; it’s a small shrine, and when I went, it was almost closing time, so there were hardly any people.

There is no direct bus here, and you have to walk a bit (about 15 minutes); after leaving the shrine, I continued walking towards the "Kumamoto Zoo" direction (about 20–30 minutes) to find the Chopper statue.

#### Chopper Statue

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*b7Qb_Ja8AiHi9SwqXCUwFA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*MLb6P17ri2J0R62G7x4d9g.jpeg)

On the way, I saw a Sergeant Major manhole cover (it seems to be from a previous event).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*df7Ps_wc5TAgu0SkP6osXQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*MmoKL92AZmjzzpsPJyj5CA.jpeg)

Found the Chopper statue at the zoo entrance.

> It seemed quite boring to check out Kumamoto Zoo beforehand, so I didn't make any special arrangements to go in; by evening, they had already closed.

**A Little Episode**  
At the zoo entrance, I encountered a Taiwanese family wanting to take a photo, so I helped them out; the next day at the airport, I ran into them again and took another photo with the airplane. The younger brother said I was the photo brother XD.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*y5ZsykQBnmg6b7N3DeWZxg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*JTgYazu_Z5maJJLiqY2QJw.jpeg)

Looking at the map, I walked further to the Ezu Lake Park in the Suizenji area, decided to check it out; I found it was **just a riverside park for locals to exercise**, so I took the bus back to the hotel (still from the bus station).  
#### [葦善らーめん](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vNGgQPncUcK3izfA6){:target="_blank"}

In the evening, I went to an izakaya near Shin-Suizenji Station for dinner.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*AhV4X5pWE9ri8Nbo4ceMIA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*V10ShLfXQNdMi_F5Svz0ng.jpeg)

With former colleagues from my previous job (Digital Technology, later featured on the cover of Line News, a.k.a. the [Irene Yu](https://medium.com/u/bc7cf3484e00){:target="_blank"} from Books.com) for dinner.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*sPQNI7cSOi_c9VzHJXoHag.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*tqrseI_XNo2_lAEsoYB1hg.jpeg)

It was so touching to have dinner with familiar people in a foreign place, especially since I had been quite withdrawn for several days (not understanding Japanese and hardly speaking). In the end, I even received some souvenirs from Beppu 😭.

I ate too quickly and only remember that the chicken wings were delicious, and I also tried horse meat skewers (Kumamoto is famous for horse meat sashimi, but I didn't dare to try it); the owner was very kind, but the menu was all in Japanese, and the characters were hard to decipher with translation software, so I could only guess XD.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ie9QWFPOfofh0IcwBYD7ww.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*7t6NYSMX5_tvRX2cb6XwJA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*zLHbPQse_maMlUzGYyuMoA.jpeg)

After dinner, I walked back to the hotel (about 15 minutes), taking a leisurely stroll through the streets of Kumamoto, stopping by Lawson and FamilyMart to buy ice cream and amazake (I initially thought it was sake, but [amazake is not alcohol; it's a nourishing summer drink](https://www.thecan.com.tw/tw/article/detail/1646){:target="_blank"}).

I also picked up breakfast for the next morning (melon bread + juice). This fruit juice from FamilyMart (melon, strawberry, etc.) is really delicious; I almost buy it whenever I see it, as it has sweet fruit pieces that taste great.

### Day 10 Return Trip

I've been wandering alone in Japan for 10 days now, and I'm starting to miss home, craving Taiwanese food and my friends in Taiwan.

The only advantage of this hotel is that there's an airport shuttle right across the street.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Q3I5e7mD3ek_Cnl2LdhQiw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*GYnDXmStxszFGUoi54CLrw.jpeg)

I encountered actual delays again, with Google Maps showing a status that had already passed; thankfully, I had learned from my experience in Nagasaki and the electronic boards, so I continued to wait patiently. I was about 10 minutes late when the bus finally arrived.

The driver helped put my suitcase in the luggage area under the bus, and I just had to remember to take it when I got off.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*uSC1NPoJtQtXzdBLiOeRNw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*9db3P4To6dwJg0sOAnrHuA.jpeg)

On the way, I encountered a wild Kumamon fence XD. Kumamon is really everywhere!

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*2dDzo0Y2tjdNBhVMakvjpA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*1CePzjcS-yUr-zB8ceFRkQ.jpeg)

I arrived at the airport early, around 9 o'clock (since I didn't have anywhere else I wanted to go, arriving later would just mean staying at the hotel until it was time to leave).

Kumamoto Airport (KMJ) is very new and small, with not many flights; there were only three international flights today, and only three counters for international flights, all of which were used interchangeably.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*fDnBvPoq3ykeKOSNwskGwQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*DgcVHY4YocMy9-EBghL_VA.jpeg)

```markdown
Check-in and baggage drop opened around 10:20. Before that, I took EVA Air (which allows two carry-on items), but I realized this time on China Airlines that only one carry-on is permitted, so I quickly compressed my items into one.

The ground staff advised not to leave immediately after checking in the baggage and to wait at the site for about 5 to 10 minutes. If there are any issues with the luggage, they will call out the number to handle it (the airport is too small, and there are no electronic boards, so you can only wait).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*dNkC6XSNAjs4gDV64iJV7w.jpeg)

After confirming everything was fine, I headed towards the international departure area. I initially thought I would have time to explore the airport, but there wasn't much to see.

> At that time, I might have really been tired. Later, I found out there is actually an observation deck to watch the planes. After checking in the luggage, you can take your time to explore and don't need to rush to the departure area.

> **Note that all the food options on the 3rd floor are located "after security check" before departure. You can turn left to the dining area, but you will need to go through security again when you return; once you complete the departure process, there are no food options left, only duty-free shops.**

There were almost no people at the departure check, and I had the security check all to myself.

Since I wasn't very hungry, I skipped the dining area and went directly to the international departure lounge.

The lounge and duty-free shop are not large, but they are new and have USB charging sockets; you can see the observation deck from here (those people on the 2nd floor).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ycJw8pExkdUEpA5_5RBXHw.jpeg)

I didn't buy anything special, just spent the remaining balance on my Apple Watch's Suica card and got two bottles of peach water to drink back in Taiwan.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*K_cVUSwpspe9re4qHkudkA.jpeg)

The flight took off on time at 12:30. Bye Kyushu, bye Kumamoto.

The return flight was on a newer plane, and they were showing the Super Mario Bros. movie, which ended just as we arrived in Taiwan. The seats were not fully occupied, so I comfortably had an entire row to myself!

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*-1ckVteQdVGh3ZA-Hvz_zQ.jpeg)

When I got off the plane, I noticed the person in front of me was wearing a helmet. Did they ride a motorcycle to the airport? 🤣

Arriving at Taoyuan Airport, it's time to go home!

While picking up my luggage, I had to wait a bit because I checked it in too early. I also tested the Airtag tracking feature, and it alerted me when my luggage was close!

Back in Taiwan, I saw Kumamon on the road again XD (it seems to be a new card promotion from Yuanta Bank).
#### **Additional Notes on Riding Buses and Trams in Japan**
- Ticket number (with a number on it) = There is a small machine at the entrance where you can take a ticket (similar to a number drawing).
- Some routes have a flat fare and may not require a ticket.
- If you use electronic payment (Suica), you can skip taking a ticket, but be careful not to let the balance go negative ( **unlike Taiwan**).
- Buses and trams do not give change, but you can exchange money at the change machine on the vehicle (also near where you put money in for the driver).
- Generally, you board from the back and exit from the front.
- Japanese buses wait for passengers; they will only depart once everyone is seated and will wait for passengers to get off before leaving. So, you can stand up only when the bus arrives at your stop, no need to crowd to the front before reaching your stop ( **unlike Taiwan**).
- When getting off, check your ticket number against the corresponding fare to pay:
