> **_I have open-sourced the results and packaged them into a Template Repo (linkyee). Friends in need can directly Fork it for quick deployment._** 




### linkyee — Your Own Link Pages


[![](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/877945203/b2d2ec07-9a56-400c-b24c-db0b180f7d3e)](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/linkyee){:target="_blank"}

#### Advantages:
- Directly deployed on GitHub Pages, stable and free
- Control over the HTML source files, allowing for modifications to layout, styles, removal of ads, and copyright notices; _\(the default style was created using GenAI ChatGPT\)_
- Supports custom domain names
- **Supports dynamic variables, such as the default variables I created for Medium followers and GitHub Repo star counts, which can automatically update the follower count on the page.** 🚀🚀🚀
- Fast page loading
- Setting up deployment can be completed in just a few simple steps as described in this article.

### GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a free static page hosting service provided by GitHub. All GitHub Free accounts can use it directly for Public Repos, while Private Repos require a paid upgrade to the GitHub account.
#### Limitations
- **Can only host static file resources:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, font files, image files, PDFs, audio files, text files, etc.
- **Website (Repo) size must not exceed:** 1 GB, which is likely a soft limit, as my GitHub Pages Jekyll Repo is already close to 5 GB.
- **Maximum deployment time:** 10 minutes
- **Maximum deployments per hour:** 10 times \(soft limit\)
- **Monthly traffic limit:** 100 GB \(soft limit\)
- Excessive requests may result in HTTP 429 responses.

### Getting Started — Deploying on GitHub Pages
#### Step 1. Click the "Use this template" button at the top right of the linkyee template repository -> "Create a new repository":


![](/assets/70aeddb1fd9b/1*G6pU845OnIyEdl-Os0EnwQ.png)

#### Step 2. Check "Include all branches," enter your desired GitHub Pages repository name, and click "Create repository" when done:

```markdown
![](/assets/70aeddb1fd9b/1*PN9zygdxqJmFtUz9Pq35cQ.png)



> _The name of the GitHub Pages Repo will be the access URL._ 





> _If you enter the Repo name as `your-username.github.io`, this will become the direct access URL for your GitHub Pages site._ 





> _If you already have a `your-username.github.io` Repo, then the GitHub Pages URL will be `your-username.github.io/Repo-Name`._ 




#### Wait for the Fork to complete. You may encounter deployment errors during the initial setup due to permission issues with the Fork repository. Next, we will make adjustments step by step.

#### Step 4. Go to Settings -> Actions -> General, and ensure the following options are selected:


![](/assets/70aeddb1fd9b/1*5c4TZm0ZjolIPPalwEbJMA.png)

- Actions permissions: Allow all actions and reusable workflows
- Workflow permissions: Read and write permissions


**After making your selections, click the Save button to save changes.**
#### Step 5. Go to Settings -> Pages, and confirm that the GitHub Pages branch is set to "gh-pages":


![](/assets/70aeddb1fd9b/1*2mmeneQOLEuhRqZIovSh9A.png)



> _The message "Your site is live at: XXXX" is your public access URL for GitHub Pages._ 




#### Step 6. Go to Settings -> Actions, and wait for the first deployment to complete:

#### Step 7. Visit the GitHub Pages URL to confirm if the Fork was successful:

> Congratulations! The deployment was successful, and now you can modify the configuration files to replace them with your information.🎉🎉🎉

Success!!
#### Customize Style, Modify Default Theme
- `./themes/default/index.html`
- `./themes/default/styles.css`
- `./themes/default/scripts.js`

#### Create a New Theme
- \./themes/ `YOUR_THEME`
- Update in the config\.yml file to `theme:YOUR_THEME`

**Yes, you can use GenAI tools like ChatGPT to help you create a custom link page! (The default style was also generated by ChatGPT.)**
#### Automatic Redeployment

By default, the project will automatically redeploy once a day to refresh the dynamic variable values of the plugins. You can adjust the cron settings in [Github Action — Automatic build \( \.github/workflows/build\.yml\)](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/linkyee/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml){:target="_blank"}:
```yaml
schedule:
 - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Executes daily at midnight 00:00 (UTC)
```

If you do not need scheduled redeployment, you can simply delete the `schedule` block.
### Custom Domain ❤️❤️❤️

You can set up a custom GitHub Pages domain, **for example, mine: [https://link\.zhgchg\.li](https://link.zhgchg.li){:target="_blank"} .**

You can refer to my previous article “[**Github Pages Custom Domain Tutorial**](../483af5d93297/)” for a step-by-step guide from purchasing to binding the domain, or you can purchase a domain through [**my Namecheap referral link**](https://namecheap.pxf.io/P0jdZQ){:target="_blank"} — I will receive a portion of the profit, which will help me continue contributing to open-source projects.
