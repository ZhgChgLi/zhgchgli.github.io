### Using Google Apps Script Web App Forms to Integrate with GitHub Action CI/CD Workflows

Optimizing GitHub Action Workflow forms and integrating with other workflow tools (Jira, Asana, Slack...) to enhance development efficiency.

### Background

Previously, the team set up a complete CI/CD service using GitHub Action & Self-hosted GitHub Runner + Slack; the overall effect was good. For app developers, building and maintaining it was relatively easy. They just needed to follow the YAML parameters provided in the official documentation to complete the setup, which would trigger automatically. Additionally, it was easy to use their own machines as runners, and the service itself was maintained by GitHub, so we didn't have to worry about version upgrades and other issues. The runner pulls tasks from GitHub, so there was no need to open external network ports. The best part for the team was that running GitHub Action on their own runner was completely free.

> _This means we could enjoy a GUI YAML build method similar to Bitrise while having the flexibility and lower build costs of using self-hosted machines like Jenkins, without the need to spend time maintaining the service itself._

> **I will write a complete article on the App CI/CD x GitHub Action setup process when I have time in the future.**

#### Problem: GitHub Action CI/CD GUI Form

![GitHub Action GUI Form](/assets/4cb4437818f2/1*55tCLFvuHtTyyvSLSv1vMA.png)

GitHub Action GUI Form

> _In app development, when triggering the CD to package test versions, production versions, or submissions, it is usually necessary to provide some external parameters or select environments and branches according to requirements before starting the workflow._

Unlike Jenkins, which is a self-hosted service with a complete web GUI, GitHub Action does not have one. The only web GUI form is a simple form that users can customize by clicking "Run workflow" in Actions to input external parameters and trigger the CI/CD workflow.

Typically, users who package for CD may not be the app developers themselves and may not have permissions for the project. For example, QA may need to package a specific version, or PM/Backend may need to package a certain development version for testing. The GitHub Action Form requires permissions for the project to use, but users may not even have project permissions or engineering backgrounds.

**Moreover, we cannot create dynamic forms or data validation here.**

> _Therefore, we need to create another GUI service for other users to operate._

#### Self-Built Slack App Solution

Previously, a team member who loved automation built a complete Slack App web service using Kotlin + Ktor, integrating Slack messages, forms, commands, etc., to receive and forward CD packaging requests, trigger GitHub Action operations, and send results back to Slack.

> _Currently, we do not have development resources to build the service using Kotlin + Ktor as before._

#### Custom Web/iOS/macOS App Tool

The team originally used Jenkins, which had a basic web interface for other users to log in, and also developed an app that integrated with Jenkins to package some parameters for easier use by non-engineering users.

> **_However, after migrating to GitHub Action, this entire setup was abandoned._**

#### ❌ Private GitHub Pages

There should be a chance to directly build GitHub Pages as a CI/CD web GUI, but currently only GitHub [Enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.13/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-github-pages-for-your-enterprise#enabling-public-sites-for-github-pages){:target="_blank"} can set GitHub Pages access permissions. Other plans, even if they are private repos, will be public; there is no security to speak of.

#### ❌ Slack App, but Built with Google Apps Script

Initially, I thought about using a Slack App as the CI/CD GUI Form service based on previous team experience, but currently, we do not have the resources to build the service using Kotlin + Ktor as before. So I thought of quickly trying to build it using Function as a Service.

There are many types of Function as a Service, and [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions?hl=zh-tw){:target="_blank"} offers more flexibility. However, due to organizational IT restrictions, we cannot freely add Public Cloud Functions, and there are cost issues; therefore, we returned to our old friend — Google Apps Script.

> _I have previously written several articles about automating with Google Apps Script; interested friends can refer to:_

> _1. **「 [Implementing Daily Data Report RPA Automation with Google Apps Script](../f6713ba3fee3/) 」**_

> _2. 「 [Simple 3 Steps — Create a Free GA4 Automatic Data Notification Bot](https://medium.com/zrealm-robotic-process-automation/%E7%B0%A1%E5%96%AE-3-%E6%AD%A5%E9%A9%9F-%E6%89%93%E9%80%A0%E5%85%8D%E8%B2%BB-ga4-%E8%87%AA%E5%8B%95%E6%95%B8%E6%93%9A%E9%80%9A%E7%9F%A5%E6%A9%9F%E5%99%A8%E4%BA%BA-1e85b8df2348?source=collection_home---6------1-----------------------){:target="_blank"} 」_

> _3. 「 [Crashlytics + Google Analytics Automatic Query for App Crash-Free Users Rate](https://medium.com/zrealm-robotic-process-automation/crashlytics-google-analytics-%E8%87%AA%E5%8B%95%E6%9F%A5%E8%A9%A2-app-crash-free-users-rate-793cb8f89b72?source=collection_home---6------8-----------------------){:target="_blank"} 」_

In summary, Google Apps Script is another Function as a Service provided by Google, characterized by being free and quickly integrating with Google services. However, it also has many limitations, such as only being able to use its language, execution time cannot exceed 6 minutes, there are limits on execution counts, and it does not support multithreading, etc. For details, you can refer to [my previous article](../f6713ba3fee3/).

The conclusion is that it is not feasible, for the following reasons:
- [Function as a Service cold start issue](https://www.cloudflare.com/zh-tw/learning/serverless/what-is-serverless/){:target="_blank"}.
If the service is not called for a period, it goes to sleep, and the next call takes longer to start (3~≥ 5 seconds); **Slack App has very strict API response time requirements, and the service needs to respond within 3 seconds, otherwise it is considered a failure**, leading to direct errors from Slack, and event listeners may be considered lost, resulting in duplicate sends.
- **Google Apps Script doGet, doPost methods cannot retrieve Headers.** 
**This prevents us from following [official security verification](https://api.slack.com/authentication/verifying-requests-from-slack){:target="_blank"} and from disabling [Slack Retry](https://api.slack.com/authentication/verifying-requests-from-slack){:target="_blank"} .**
- Google Apps Script single-threading issue.
If we need to connect to other services, the response time will exceed 3 seconds, which Slack will directly determine as a failure.

I managed to use Slack messages, Block Kit, and forms to connect the entire process, but it was too easy to trigger the above issues, so I eventually gave up.

> **_If you want to implement this, you should set up your own server and service, rather than using Function as a Service!_**

#### ❌ Slack Workflow Form

![](/assets/4cb4437818f2/1*KWBMdFswvl1KPdnTLStzhQ.png)

![[Slack Workflow Form](https://slack.com/intl/zh-tw/help/articles/24720245025555-%E8%87%AA%E5%8B%95%E5%8C%96%EF%BC%9A%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E7%B0%A1%E6%98%93%E8%A1%A8%E5%96%AE%E6%94%B6%E9%9B%86%E8%B3%87%E8%A8%8A){:target="_blank"} \(❌ Cannot be customized\)](/assets/4cb4437818f2/1*hnDPyOfGCTW_yJf71krMnA.png)

[Slack Workflow Form](https://slack.com/intl/zh-tw/help/articles/24720245025555-%E8%87%AA%E5%8B%95%E5%8C%96%EF%BC%9A%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E7%B0%A1%E6%98%93%E8%A1%A8%E5%96%AE%E6%94%B6%E9%9B%86%E8%B3%87%E8%A8%8A){:target="_blank"} \(❌ Cannot be customized\)

I also tried Slack's built-in automation feature, the Workflow Form, but it cannot create dynamic form content (e.g., fetching branches for user selection); the only customizable part is the subsequent data submission step.

### ✅ Google Apps Script Web App GUI Form

When one path is blocked, another opens. It seems we don't need to be fixated on integrating with Slack. While integrating with Slack is the best solution since it directly integrates into existing team collaboration tools without needing to learn new tools, due to resource constraints, we can only settle for finding other stable and user-friendly methods.

> _Looking back, Google Apps Script can be deployed as a Web App, allowing us to respond with a GUI Form when doing a Web doGet, and after submitting the form, it can trigger subsequent GitHub integration processing._

#### **Workflow**

We built a CI/CD form using Google Apps Script Web App, directly binding it to Google Workspace accounts, setting it so that only users within the organization can access it. It automatically retrieves the currently logged-in user's email, uses a shared GitHub Repo account (or borrows a personal access token from an account with permissions) to call the GitHub API to get the branch list, and after submission, it similarly calls the API to trigger GitHub Action to start executing the CI/CD workflow.

Additionally, we can use the user's email to call the Slack API through the Slack App to obtain that user's Slack ID, and then send messages through the Slack App to notify about the CI/CD task execution status.

We can also integrate with other tools and development processes, such as first obtaining work orders from Asana or Jira, selecting them, and then using the GitHub API to find branches, trigger GitHub Action, and finally notify the user via Slack.

#### Step 1. Create Google Apps Script Web App Form

Go to > [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/home){:target="_blank"}, and create a new project.

#### Step 2. Create Form Content and GAS Program

Having not written HTML and CSS for a long time and being too lazy to design styles myself, I directly asked ChatGPT to generate an HTML form template with some design.

![](/assets/4cb4437818f2/1*IPv0afE5FAFj40F22s8Umg.png)

![](/assets/4cb4437818f2/1*F_HrfV_k16g_ojm1WIDDuA.png)

In the file list on the left side of GAS, click "+" to add a file, name it "`Form.html`", and paste the HTML form template content generated by GPT.

`Form.html：`
```xml
<!--HTML & Style Gen by ChatGPT 4o-->

      <div class="form-group">
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </div>
    </form>
  </div>
  <script>
    function displayMessage(ok, message) {
      const messageBlock = document.getElementById('message-block');
      messageBlock.className = ok ? 'message success' : 'message error';
      messageBlock.innerHTML = message;
      messageBlock.classList.remove('hidden');
    }
    
    document.getElementById("myForm").addEventListener("submit", function(e) {
      e.preventDefault();
      const formData = new FormData(this);
      const formObject = Object.fromEntries(formData);
      google.script.run.withSuccessHandler((response) => {
        displayMessage(response.ok, response.message);
      }).processForm(formObject);
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

```markdown
The content of the form can be adjusted according to your needs.

`code.gs:`
```javascript
function doGet(e) {
  // Corresponds to the left file Form.html
  const htmlTemplate = HtmlService.createTemplateFromFile('Form');
  
  const email = Session.getActiveUser().getEmail();
  // Get the user's email, limited to the execution identity: access to the web application user setting is valid
  
  const title = "App CD Packaging Request Form";
  
  const buildNumber = genBuildNumber();

  htmlTemplate.email = email;
  htmlTemplate.title = title;
  htmlTemplate.pullRequests = []; // Next step is to connect to Github...
  htmlTemplate.buildNumber = buildNumber;

  const html = htmlTemplate.evaluate();
  html.setTitle(title);
  //html.setWidth(600) // Set the page width

  return html
}

function processForm(object) {
  return {"ok": true, "message": "Request submitted successfully!"};
}

function genBuildNumber() {
  const now = new Date();
  const formattedDate = Utilities.formatDate(now, "Asia/Taipei", "yyyyMMddHHmmss");
  const milliseconds = now.getMilliseconds().toString().padStart(3, '0'); // Ensure milliseconds are 3 digits
  return `${formattedDate}${milliseconds}`; 
}
```

In this step, we first complete the form GUI, and in the next step, we will connect to the Github API to retrieve the PR branch list.

#### Step 2. Deploy Google Apps Script Web App Form

Let's deploy the content we just created once to check the results.

In the top right corner of GAS, select "Deploy" -> "New deployment" -> "Web application":

![](/assets/4cb4437818f2/1*ouVO18FtOcX8vdeGCEtwCw.png)

![](/assets/4cb4437818f2/1*4BuEtIA4H_-Q9WALonYxYg.png)

![](/assets/4cb4437818f2/1*JagpVPTGD-W0lhIJ5nrRew.png)

The execution identity and who can access can be set as follows:

**Execution identity: Me** 
`The script will run under your account.`
- Who can access: Only me
- Who can access: All users in the same organization
`Only users from the same organization and logged-in Google accounts can access.`
- Who can access: All logged-in Google account users
`All logged-in Google account users can access.`
- Who can access: Everyone
`No need to log in to a Google account; everyone can access publicly.`

**Execution identity: User accessing the web application** 
`The script will run under your account.`
- Who can access: Only me
- Who can access: All users in the same organization
`Only users from the same organization and logged-in Google accounts can access.`
- Who can access: All logged-in Google account users
`All logged-in Google account users can access.`

> _By choosing "Who can access: All users in the same organization" + "Execution identity: User accessing the web application," we can **automatically restrict access to only organization accounts** and run under their own identity!_ 

> _This is a very convenient permission control feature!_

After making your selections, click "Deploy" in the bottom right.

![](/assets/4cb4437818f2/1*dvyqYb5kcta402j3RUYJog.png)

The URL in the web application is the access URL for the Web App.
```bash
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbw8SuK7lLLMdY86y3jxMJyzXqa5tdxJryRnteOnNi-lK--j6CmKYXj7UuU58DiS0NSVvA/exec
```

> _The URL is long and ugly, but there's nothing we can do about it; we can only find a URL shortening tool to shorten it a bit._

**Click the URL to open the page and see the effect:**

![](/assets/4cb4437818f2/1*jbx4IO4DEhqYfwI_UTQk5Q.png)

**Here are two GAS limitations to note:**
- The warning message at the top of the GAS Web App cannot be hidden by default.
- The GAS Web App embeds our page using an IFrame, making it difficult to achieve 100% responsive design (RWD). You can only use `.setWidth()` to adjust the window width.

#### Google Apps Script Authorization Warning

**The first time you use it**, clicking "Debug" or "Run" may trigger the following authorization warning:

![](/assets/4cb4437818f2/1*9q8KZGHER9vdtnbKVVQB9g.png)

![](/assets/4cb4437818f2/1*iWrkqMf8vkEGkiwkI1amIw.jpeg)

Select the account you want to execute with. If you see "This application is not verified by Google," click "Advanced" -> "Go to XXX (unsafe)" and select "Allow":

![](/assets/4cb4437818f2/1*ucaqLxh-TOgJIaGyqqFd3A.png)

![](/assets/4cb4437818f2/1*l-tma_YICU24goKvZvl7Ww.png)

![](/assets/4cb4437818f2/1*JAs_3__Qt2XeDcQiKEUNhg.png)

If the permissions for the GAS program change (for example, adding access to Google Sheets, etc.), you will need to reauthorize; otherwise, it will not appear again after the first time.

#### Step 3. Connect to the Github API to Retrieve PR Branch List

We will add a new `Github.gs` script file to store the logic related to the Github API.

`Github.gs:`
```javascript
// SECRET
const githubPersonalAccessToken = ""
// Create a PAT using your Github account or a shared Github account from your organization
// https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens

// Method 1: Access via Restful API
function githubAPI(method, path, payload = null) {
  try {
    const url = "https://api.github.com"+path;  
    var options = {
      method: method,
      headers: {
        "Accept": "application/vnd.github+json",
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${githubPersonalAccessToken}`,
        "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2022-11-28"
      }
    };

    if (method.toLowerCase().trim() == "post") {
      options.payload = JSON.stringify(payload);
    }

    const response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url, options);
    const data = JSON.parse(response.getContentText());
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    throw error;
  }
}

// Method 2: Access via GraphQL
// Some more detailed query functions in the Github API are only available through the GraphQL API
// https://docs.github.com/en/graphql
function githubGraphQL(query, variables) {
  const url = "https://api.github.com/graphql";
  const payload = {
    query: query,
    variables: variables
  };

  const options = {
    method: "post",
    contentType: "application/json",
    headers: {
      "Accept": "application/vnd.github+json",
      "Authorization": `Bearer ${githubPersonalAccessToken}`,
      "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2022-11-28"
    },
    payload: JSON.stringify(payload)
  };

  try {
    const response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url, options);
    const data = JSON.parse(response.getContentText());
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    throw error;
  }
}

// GraphQL Example:
// const query = `
//   query($owner: String!, $repo: String!) {
//     repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
//       pullRequests(states: OPEN, first: 100, orderBy: { field: CREATED_AT, direction: DESC }) {
//         nodes {
//           title
//           url
//           number
//           createdAt
//           author {
//             login
//           }
//           headRefName
//           baseRefName
//           body
//         }
//         pageInfo {
//           hasNextPage
//           endCursor
//         }
//       }
//     }
//   }
// `;
// const variables = {
//   owner: "swiftlang",
//   repo: "swift"
// };
// const response = githubGraphQL(query, variables);
```

There are two ways to access the Github API: one is the traditional Restful method, and the other is the more flexible GraphQL; this article uses Restful as an example.

`code.gs:`
```kotlin
function doGet(e) {
  // Corresponds to the left file Form.html
  const htmlTemplate = HtmlService.createTemplateFromFile('Form');
  
  const email = Session.getActiveUser().getEmail();
  // Get the user's email, limited to the execution identity: access to the web application user setting is valid

  const title = "App CD Packaging Request Form";
  
  const pullRequests = githubAPI("get", "/repos/swiftlang/swift/pulls");
  // Using https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/pulls as an example
  
  const buildNumber = genBuildNumber();

  htmlTemplate.email = email;
  htmlTemplate.title = title;
  htmlTemplate.pullRequests = pullRequests;
  htmlTemplate.buildNumber = buildNumber;

  const html = htmlTemplate.evaluate();
  html.setTitle(title);
  //html.setWidth(600) // Set the page width

  return html
}

function processForm(object) {
  if (object.buildNumber == "") {
    return {"ok": false, "message": "Please enter the version number!"};
  }
  if (object.branch == "") {
    return {"ok": false, "message": "Please select a branch version!"};
  }

  // Include the parameters you want to pass to Github Action
  const payload = {
    ref: object.branch,
    inputs: {
      buildNumber: object.buildNumber
    }
  };
  
  //  
  try {
    const response = githubAPI("post", "/repos/zhgchgli0718/ios-project-for-github-action-ci-cd-demo/actions/workflows/CD-Job.yml/dispatches", payload);
    // Using https://github.com/zhgchgli0718/ios-project-for-github-action-ci-cd-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/CD-Job.yml as an example

    return {"ok": true, "message": `Packaging request sent successfully!<br/>Corresponding branch: <strong>${object.branch}</strong><br/>Version number: <strong>${object.buildNumber}</strong>`};
  } catch (error) {
    return {"ok": false, "message": "An error occurred: " + error.message};
  }
}
```

The `processForm` method handles the content returned from the form and can also include more parameters.

#### GAS x Github API x Github Action

Here, I will add some details corresponding to the Github Action.

`CD-Job.yml:`
```yaml
# CD Packaging Job

name: CD-Job

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      buildNumber: # Corresponds to GAS payload.inputs.xxx
        description: 'Version number'
        required: false
        type: string
      # ...More
      # Input types can refer to the official documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onworkflow_dispatchinputs
      
jobs:
  some-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Print Inputs
        run: |
          echo "Release Build Number: ${{ github.event.inputs.buildNumber }}"    
```
#### Step 4. Redeploy Google Apps Script Web App Form

Now you can share this link within your organization with other partners, and they can directly use this web GUI to execute CI/CD tasks.

#### Extension (1) — Query Slack User ID & Send/Update Progress Notifications Using User's Email

As mentioned earlier, we want to notify users of the CI/CD execution status in real-time. We can use the email provided by the user to look up the Slack User ID.

`Slack.gs:`
```javascript
const slackBotToken = ""
// https://medium.com/zrealm-robotic-process-automation/slack-chatgpt-integration-bd94cc88f9c9

function slackRequest(path, content) {
  const options = {
    method: "post",
    contentType: "application/json",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${slackBotToken}`, // Use the bot token for authorization,
      'X-Slack-No-Retry': 1
    },
    payload: JSON.stringify(content)
  };

  try {
    const response = UrlFetchApp.fetch("https://slack.com/api/"+path, options);
    const responseData = JSON.parse(response.getContentText());
    if (responseData.ok) {
      return responseData
    } else {
      throw new Error(`Slack: ${responseData.error}`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    throw error;
  }
}

// Query Slack UID using email
function getSlackUserId(email) {
  return slackRequest(`users.lookupByEmail?email=${encodeURIComponent(email)}`)?.user?.id;
}

// Send a message to the target Slack UID (channelID)
function sendSlackMessage(channelId, ts = null, value)  {
  var content = {
    channel: channelId
  };

  if (ts != null) {
    content.thread_ts = ts;
  }
  
  if (typeof value === "string") {
    content.text = value;
  } else {
    content.blocks = value;
  }
  return slackRequest("chat.postMessage", content);
}

// Update the content of the sent message
function updateSlackMessage(channelId, ts = null, value)  {
  var content = {
    channel: channelId
  };

  if (ts != null) {
    content.ts = ts;
  }
  
  if (typeof value === "string") {
    content.text = value;
  } else {
    content.blocks = value;
  }
  return slackRequest("chat.update", content);
}
```

For Slack API usage, please refer to the [official documentation](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage){:target="_blank"}.

**Github Action YAML can use this Action to continuously update messages and send Slack messages:**

#### Extension (2) — Query Jira Tickets

`Jira.gs:`
```javascript
const jiraPersonalAccessToken = ""
// https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html

function getJiraTickets() {
  const url = `https://xxx.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/search`;

  // JQL query
  const jql = `project = XXX`;
  const queryParams = {
    jql: jql,
    maxResults: 50, // Adjust as needed
  };

  const options = {
    method: "get",
    headers: {
      Authorization: "Basic " + jiraPersonalAccessToken,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    muteHttpExceptions: true,
  };
```
```

```javascript
const queryString = Object.keys(queryParams).map(key => `${encodeURIComponent(key)}=${encodeURIComponent(queryParams[key])}`).join("&");
const response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url + "?" + queryString + "&fields=", options);
// could specify only return some fields

if (response.getResponseCode() === 200) {
  const issues = JSON.parse(response.getContentText()).issues;
  return issues;
} else {
  Logger.log(`Error: ${response.getResponseCode()} - ${response.getContentText()}`);
  throw new Error("Failed to fetch Jira issues.");
}
```

#### Extension \(3\) — Query Asana Tasks

`Asana.gs:`
```kotlin
const asanaPersonalAccessToken = ""
// https://developers.asana.com/docs/personal-access-token

function asanaAPI(endpoint, method = "GET", data = null) {
    var options = {
      "method" : method,
      "contentType" : "application/json",
      "headers": {
          "Authorization":  "Bearer "+asanaPersonalAccessToken
      }
    };

    if (data != null) {
      options["payload"] = JSON.stringify({"data":data});
    }

    const url = "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0"+endpoint;
    const res = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url, options);
    const data = JSON.parse(res.getContentText());
    return data;
}

// Find tasks in project
// asanaAPI("/projects/PROJECT_ID/tasks");
```

### Summary

The missing element in automation, work, and development process optimization is never technology, but rather ideas; as long as we have ideas, we can find the right technology to implement them. Let's encourage each other!
