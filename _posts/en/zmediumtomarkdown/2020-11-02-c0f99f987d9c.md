### Apple Watch Official Stainless Steel Milanese Loop Unboxing

Apple Official Stainless Steel 44mm Graphite Milanese Loop Unboxing

Following the previous article "[Apple Watch Series 6 Unboxing & Two-Year Review](../eab0e984043/)," I finally decided to buy the [official Milanese Loop band](https://www.apple.com/tw/shop/product/MTU22FE/A/40-%E5%85%AC%E9%87%91%E9%8A%80%E8%89%B2%E7%B1%B3%E8%98%AD%E5%BC%8F%E9%8C%B6%E7%92%B0){:target="_blank"}. I had wanted it for two years but never pulled the trigger. This time, I upgraded everything at once. Since Apple guarantees the band is compatible with all future Apple Watch versions, I'm not worried about the band becoming unusable after future watch upgrades.

### 2025/08 Update:

Currently, my Milanese watch strap has been used for nearly 5 years without significant wear, rust, stretching, or odor. Compared to other straps I've owned, this one is the longest-lasting and most durable.

#### Advantages

The Milanese loop is made of stainless steel mesh and a magnetic clasp. The stainless steel mesh offers breathability, quick drying, and no odor. The magnetic clasp allows the strap to be adjusted to any position, fits the wrist better, is easy to wear, and has a strong magnet that prevents it from falling off. Most importantly, it makes the Apple Watch look more formal and pairs better with outfits.

#### Disadvantages

Pinching hair, pinching hair, pinching hair, feels heavier.

#### Original vs Third-Party?

Lurking in Apple communities for a while, I've noticed the most common question is about original vs third-party Milanese bands. Personally, I think the difference is minor, mainly in details and craftsmanship. The original can also catch hair, but its weaving is delicate and seamless. The magnet is strong and won’t loosen, and it feels clean and skin-friendly without a rust smell. However, the price difference is several times (the original costs $3,100). It’s best to feel the actual product before deciding. I guess third-party Milanese bands priced around 1,000 to 2,000 are almost as good as the original in craftsmanship.

#### Size

Same as the [previous article](../eab0e984043/), it is recommended that those with smaller wrists buy the Apple Watch 40 mm, because the 40 mm Milanese band fits wrist sizes 130–180 mm; compared to the 44 mm Milanese band, which fits wrist sizes 150–200 mm, it is 20 mm shorter.

The watch strap is a one-piece design with a fixed length and cannot be adjusted; if the strap is already tightened but still too loose, you can only consider third-party straps, or just gain some weight (?). Therefore, it's safer to try it on at a store first.
