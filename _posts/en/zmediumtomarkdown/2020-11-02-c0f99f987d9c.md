### Unboxing the Apple Watch Original Stainless Steel Milanese Loop

Unboxing the Apple original stainless steel 44mm graphite Milanese loop

Following the previous article "[Apple Watch Series 6 Unboxing & Two-Year Experience](../eab0e984043/)", I finally decided to purchase the [original Milanese loop](https://www.apple.com/tw/shop/product/MTU22FE/A/40-%E5%85%AC%E9%87%90%E9%8A%80%E8%89%B2%E7%B1%B3%E8%98%AD%E5%BC%8F%E9%8C%B6%E7%92%B0){:target="_blank"} this time. I had wanted to buy it two years ago but never did; this time, I took the opportunity to upgrade. Apple guarantees that the strap will be compatible with all subsequent versions of the Apple Watch, so I’m not worried about it becoming unusable after upgrading the watch.

#### Advantages

The Milanese loop is made of stainless steel mesh and a magnetic clasp. The benefits of the stainless steel mesh are its breathability and quick-drying properties. The magnetic clasp allows the strap to be adjusted to any position, fitting the wrist better, making it easy to wear, and the strong magnet ensures it won’t fall off. Most importantly, it makes the Apple Watch look more formal and better matches outfits.

#### Disadvantages

It attracts hair, attracts hair, attracts hair, and is relatively heavy.

#### Original vs. Third-Party?

Having lurked in Apple communities for a long time, I’ve noticed that the most frequently asked question is about the original Milanese loop vs. third-party options. Personally, I think the difference is minimal, mainly in the details and craftsmanship. The original also attracts hair, but its weaving is very delicate and seamless, and the magnetic part has a strong magnet that won’t loosen. It’s clean and skin-friendly without a metallic smell, but the price difference is several times (the original costs $3,100). It’s best to try the actual product before deciding. I suspect that third-party Milanese loops priced at 1,000 to 2,000 should be almost equivalent in craftsmanship to the original.

#### Size

As mentioned in the [previous article](../eab0e984043/), I recommend that those with smaller wrists purchase the Apple Watch 40mm, as the 40mm Milanese loop fits wrist circumferences of 130–180mm. In comparison, the 44mm Milanese loop fits wrist circumferences of 150–200mm, which is 20mm shorter.

The strap is a one-piece design and cannot be adjusted in length. If the strap is already adjusted tightly and is still too large, you can only consider third-party options, or just gain a bit of weight (?). So it’s safer to try it on in-store.

> _A friend's case: with a small wrist, they bought the 44mm + Milanese loop, and it can only be adjusted to the tightest setting, which looks a bit "loose"!_

Similar to the original silicone strap, but the difference is that it doesn’t come with an extra short strap XD
