### iOS Deferred Deep Link Implementation \(Swift\)

Create a seamless app transition process that adapts to all scenarios.

### \[2022/07/22\] Update on Upcoming Changes in iOS 16

Starting from iOS ≥ 16, when a user does not actively paste, the app's attempt to read the clipboard will trigger a prompt asking for permission. The user must allow this for the app to access clipboard information.

#### Unrelated

After graduating and serving in the military, I've been working for almost three years now. My growth has plateaued, and I've started to settle into my comfort zone. Fortunately, I decided to resign and take a step back to re-evaluate my path.

While reading [Designing Your Life](https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010733134){:target="_blank"}, I reflected on my career and life. Although my technical skills aren't exceptional, writing on Medium and sharing with others helps me enter a "flow" state and gain a lot of energy. Recently, a friend asked about Deep Link issues, so I organized my research on the topic and replenished my energy in the process!

### Scenarios

First, let's clarify the actual application scenarios.

1. When a user clicks a URL link (from Google search, FB post, Line link, etc.) while having the app installed, it should directly open the app to display the target screen. If the app is not installed, it should redirect to the App Store to install the app; **after installation, opening the app should recreate the previously intended screen**.

[![iOS Deferred Deep Link Demo](/assets/b08ef940c196/249b_hqdefault.jpg "iOS Deferred Deep Link Demo")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY6-Q7BFUOM){:target="_blank"}

2. We want to track app downloads and openings to know how many users actually downloaded and opened the app from the promotional link.

3. Special event entries, for example, users can receive rewards by opening the app after downloading via a specific URL.

#### Support:

iOS ≥ 9
### What is the Difference Between Deferred Deep Link and Deep Link?
#### Pure Deep Link:

![](/assets/b08ef940c196/1*15arO4L94ZoEyOLtFARtsA.jpeg)

As you can see, the mechanism of iOS Deep Link only checks whether the app is installed. If it is, the app opens; if not, it does nothing.

#### First, we need to add a prompt for "redirect to the App Store if not installed" to inform users to install the app:

The **URL Scheme** part is controlled by the system and is rarely publicly disclosed for internal app calls; if the trigger point is in an area that you cannot control (e.g., Line link), it cannot be processed.

If the trigger point is on your own webpage, you can use some tricks. Please refer to [**this link**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/627916/check-if-url-scheme-is-supported-in-javascript){:target="_blank"}:
```xml
<html>
<head>
  <title>Redirect...</title>
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
  <script>
    var appurl = 'marry://open';
    var appstore = 'https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/%E7%B5%90%E5%A9%9A%E5%90%A7-%E6%9C%80%E5%A4%A7%E5%A9%9A%E7%A6%AE%E7%B1%8C%E5%82%99app/id1356057329';

    var timeout;
    function start() {
      window.location = appurl;
      timeout = setTimeout(function(){
        if(confirm('Would you like to install the Marry App now?')){
          document.location = appstore;
        }
      }, 1000);
    }

    window.onload = function() {
      start()
    }
  </script>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```

The basic logic is to **call the URL Scheme, then set a timeout. If the page hasn't redirected after the timeout, assume the scheme cannot be called, and redirect to the App Store page** (though the experience is still poor, as it may show an error message, but at least it has an automatic redirect).

**Universal Link** is essentially your own webpage. If it doesn't redirect, it defaults to displaying in a web browser. If you have web services, you can choose to directly open the webpage; if not, it will redirect to the App Store page.

Websites with web services can add the following in `<head></head>`:
```xml
<meta name="apple-itunes-app" content="app-id=APPID, app-argument=page-parameter">
```

![](/assets/b08ef940c196/1*nC1JytAwIwKU04EMBBvf0A.jpeg)

When browsing the webpage version on iPhone Safari, a prompt to install the app and a button to open this page in the app will appear; the parameter `app-argument` is used to pass the page value to the app.

#### Complete Deep Link Handling on the App Side:

What we want is not just "open the app if the user has it installed," but also to connect the source information with the app, allowing the app to automatically display the target page after opening.

The **URL Scheme** method can be handled in `func application(_ application: UIApplication, open url: URL, sourceApplication: String?, annotation: Any) -> Bool` in AppDelegate:
```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, open url: URL, sourceApplication: String?, annotation: Any) -> Bool {
    if url.scheme == "marry", let params = url.queryParameters {
      if params["type"] == "topic" {
        let VC = TopicViewController(topicID: params["id"])
        UIApplication.shared.keyWindow?.rootViewController?.present(VC, animated: true)
      }    
    }
    return true
}
```

**Universal Link** is handled in `func application(_ application: UIApplication, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity, restorationHandler: @escaping ([Any]?) -> Void) -> Bool` in AppDelegate:
```swift
extension URL {
    /// test=1&a=b&c=d => ["test":"1","a":"b","c":"d"]
    /// Parses the URL query into a [String: String] dictionary
    public var queryParameters: [String: String]? {
        guard let components = URLComponents(url: self, resolvingAgainstBaseURL: true), let queryItems = components.queryItems else {
            return nil
        }
        
        var parameters = [String: String]()
        for item in queryItems {
            parameters[item.name] = item.value
        }
        
        return parameters
    }
    
}
```

First, here's a URL extension method `queryParameters` for easily converting URL queries into a Swift Dictionary.
```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity, restorationHandler: @escaping ([Any]?) -> Void) -> Bool {
        
  if userActivity.activityType == NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb, let webpageURL = userActivity.webpageURL {
    /// If it's a universal link URL...
    let params = webpageURL.queryParameters
    
    if params["type"] == "topic" {
      let VC = TopicViewController(topicID: params["id"])
      UIApplication.shared.keyWindow?.rootViewController?.present(VC, animated: true)
    }
  }
  
  return true  
}
```

![](/assets/b08ef940c196/1*zhtWK56EqWpE91yTVu64Lg.jpeg)

Done!
#### What Else Is Missing?

It seems perfect so far; we've handled all the scenarios we might encounter. So what else is missing?

![](/assets/b08ef940c196/1*ulrLKyvTKoChPScWD9wHyA.jpeg)

As shown in the diagram, if the user has not installed the app -> installs from the App Store -> opens from the App Store, the source data will be lost, and the app won't know the source, so it will only display the homepage. The user would have to go back to the previous webpage and click to open it again for the app to navigate to the desired page.

> _While this is not impossible, considering the drop-off rate during transitions, adding an extra step increases the likelihood of losing users, and the user experience becomes less smooth; moreover, users may not be that savvy._ 

#### Key Points of This Article

What is Deferred Deep Link? It allows our Deep Link to extend to retain source data even after the app is installed from the App Store.

According to Android engineers, Android has this functionality built-in, but iOS does not support this setting, and achieving this functionality is not user-friendly. Please continue reading.
### Deferred Deep Link

> _If you don't want to spend time implementing this yourself, you can directly use [branch.io](http://branch.io){:target="_blank"} or [Firebase Dynamic Links](https://firebase.google.com/docs/dynamic-links){:target="_blank"} The method introduced in this article is the one used by Firebase._ 

**To achieve the effect of Deferred Deep Link, there are two methods available online:**

One method calculates a hash value based on user device, IP, environment, etc., and stores data on the server from the webpage; when the app is opened after installation, it calculates the value in the same way. If the values match, it retrieves the data (as done by branch.io).

The other method, which this article will introduce, is similar to Firebase's approach; it uses the iPhone clipboard and the shared mechanism between Safari and the app's cookies, effectively storing data in the clipboard or cookies, which the app can read after installation.

![](/assets/b08ef940c196/1*VVahSlHV2N2jcIw4afzr2g.jpeg)

```
After clicking "Open," your clipboard will be automatically overwritten with JavaScript, copying the relevant jump information: https://XXX.app.goo.gl/?link=https://XXX.net/topicID=1&type=topic
```

Those who have used Firebase Dynamic Links will be familiar with this opening jump page; once you understand the principle, you'll realize this page cannot be removed from the flow!

Additionally, Firebase does not allow for style modifications.
#### Support

First, let's talk about a pitfall regarding support; as mentioned earlier, it's "not user-friendly"!

![](/assets/b08ef940c196/1*LR3MSAcwjaoSQhwvtD2sUQ.png)

If the app only considers iOS ≥ 10, it's much easier. The app can implement clipboard access, and the web can use JavaScript to overwrite the clipboard information, then redirect to the App Store for download.

iOS = 9 does not support automatic clipboard access via JavaScript but does support **Cookie sharing between Safari and the app's SFSafariViewController**.

Additionally, the app needs to secretly load an SFSafariViewController in the background to retrieve the cookie information stored when the link was clicked.

> _The steps are cumbersome, and link clicks are limited to the Safari browser._ 

![[SFSafariViewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller){:target="_blank"}](/assets/b08ef940c196/1*tPXHlrQE3MdrjMzFbnS_4w.png)

[SFSafariViewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller){:target="_blank"}

> _According to official documentation, starting from iOS 11, it is no longer possible to access the user's Safari cookies. If you need this functionality, you can use SFAuthenticationSession, but this method cannot run in the background and will always prompt the following dialog before loading:_

![_SFAuthenticationSession Prompt_](/assets/b08ef940c196/1*eisreftWPWn9PTCbuLQqdw.jpeg)

_SFAuthenticationSession Prompt_

> _Furthermore, app review does not allow placing SFSafariViewController in areas where users cannot see it. \(Triggering it programmatically and then adding it as a subview is not easily detectable\)_ 

### Implementation

Let's start with the simpler part, considering only users on iOS ≥ 10, using the iPhone clipboard to transfer information.
#### Web Side:

![](/assets/b08ef940c196/1*P2saSHeIX7TZyCQY0StN1Q.jpeg)

We customized our own page similar to Firebase Dynamic Links, using the `clipboard.js` library to allow users to click "Go Now," which first copies the information we want to send to the app to the clipboard `（marry://topicID=1&type=topic）`, and then uses `location.href` to redirect to the App Store page.
#### App Side:

In the AppDelegate or main UIViewController, read the clipboard value:

`let pasteData = UIPasteboard.general.string`

It is recommended to wrap the information using the URL Scheme for easier identification and data resolution:
```swift
if let pasteData = UIPasteboard.general.string, let url = URL(string: pasteData), url.scheme == "marry", let params = url.queryParameters {
    if params["type"] == "topic" {
      let VC = TopicViewController(topicID: params["id"])
      UIApplication.shared.keyWindow?.rootViewController?.present(VC, animated: true)
    }
}
```

Finally, after processing the action, use `UIPasteboard.general.string = ""` to clear the information from the clipboard.
### Implementation — Supporting iOS 9

Here comes the tricky part: supporting iOS 9. As mentioned earlier, since clipboard access is not supported, we need to use the **Cookie sharing method**.
#### Web Side:

The web side is relatively straightforward; we just need to change it so that when the user clicks "Go Now," we store the information we want to send to the app in a cookie `（marry://topicID=1&type=topic）`, and then use `location.href` to redirect to the App Store page.

Here are two encapsulated JavaScript methods for handling cookies to speed up development:
```javascript
/// name: Cookie name
/// val: Cookie value
/// day: Cookie expiration, default is 1 day
/// EX1: setcookie("iosDeepLinkData","marry://topicID=1&type=topic")
/// EX2: setcookie("hey","hi",365) = valid for one year
function setcookie(name, val, day) {
    var exdate = new Date();
    day = day || 1;
    exdate.setDate(exdate.getDate() + day);
    document.cookie = "" + name + "=" + val + ";expires=" + exdate.toGMTString();
}

/// getCookie("iosDeepLinkData") => marry://topicID=1&type=topic
function getCookie(name) {
    var arr = document.cookie.match(new RegExp("(^| )" + name + "=([^;]*)(;|$)"));
    if (arr != null) return decodeURI(arr[2]);
    return null;
}
```
#### App Side:

This is the most complicated part of the article.

As mentioned earlier, we need to secretly load an SFSafariViewController in the background within the main UIViewController without the user noticing.

**Another pitfall:** The secret loading of SFSafariViewController will not work if its size is set to less than 1, its opacity is less than 0.05, or if it is set to hidden.

> p.s. iOS = 10 supports both Cookie and clipboard.

title: iOS Deferred Deep Link Implementation
---

My approach here is to place a UIView at the top of the main page's UIViewController with an arbitrary height, aligning its bottom with the top of the main page's UIView. Then, I connect the IBOutlet `sharedCookieView` to the class. In the `viewDidLoad()` method, I initialize the SFSafariViewController and add its view to `sharedCookieView`. So, it does load and display, but it runs off the screen, making it invisible to the user 🌝.

**What URL should the SFSafariViewController point to?**

Similar to the web sharing page, we need to create another page for reading cookies and place both pages under the same domain to avoid cross-domain cookie issues. I will attach the page content later.
```swift
@IBOutlet weak var SharedCookieView: UIView!

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    
    let url = URL(string:"http://app.marry.com.tw/loadCookie.html")
    let sharedCookieViewController = SFSafariViewController(url: url)
    VC.view.frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 200, height: 200)
    sharedCookieViewController.delegate = self
    
    self.addChildViewController(sharedCookieViewController)
    self.SharedCookieView.addSubview(sharedCookieViewController.view)
    
    sharedCookieViewController.beginAppearanceTransition(true, animated: false)
    sharedCookieViewController.didMove(toParentViewController: self)
    sharedCookieViewController.endAppearanceTransition()
}
```

`sharedCookieViewController.delegate = self`

`class HomeViewController: UIViewController, SFSafariViewControllerDelegate`

You need to add this delegate to capture the callback after the loading is complete.

We can capture the loading completion event in:

`func safariViewController(_ controller: SFSafariViewController, didCompleteInitialLoad didLoadSuccessfully: Bool) {`

At this point, you might think that the next step is to read the cookies from the webpage in `didCompleteInitialLoad`, and that would be done!

Here, I couldn't find a method to read cookies from SFSafariViewController; the methods I found online return empty results.

> _Alternatively, you might need to use JavaScript to interact with the page content, asking JavaScript to read the cookies and return them to the UIViewController._ 

#### The Tricky URL Scheme Method

Since iOS doesn't know how to retrieve shared cookies, we can let the "cookie reading page" handle the "cookie reading" for us.

The `getCookie()` method from the JavaScript cookie handling approach mentioned earlier is used for this. Our "cookie reading page" is just a blank page (since the user won't see it), but in the JavaScript part, we need to read the cookies after the body onload:
```xml
<html>
<head>
  <title>Load iOS Deep Link Saved Cookie...</title>
  <script>
  function checkCookie() {
    var iOSDeepLinkData = getCookie("iOSDeepLinkData");
    if (iOSDeepLinkData && iOSDeepLinkData != '') {
        setcookie("iOSDeepLinkData", "", -1);
        window.location.href = iOSDeepLinkData; /// marry://topicID=1&type=topic
    }
  }
  </script>
</head>

<body onload="checkCookie();">

</body>

</html>
```

The actual principle summary is: when `HomeViewController viewDidLoad` is called, we add `SFSafariViewController` to stealthily load the `loadCookie.html` page. The `loadCookie.html` page checks for previously stored cookies, and if found, it reads and clears them, then uses `window.location.href` to trigger the `URL Scheme` mechanism.

Thus, the corresponding callback handling will return to the `AppDelegate` in the `func application(_ application: UIApplication, open url: URL, sourceApplication: String?, annotation: Any) -> Bool` for processing.
### Completed! Summary:

![](/assets/b08ef940c196/1*kp26TdlJBW5sVxw4zYa9Rg.jpeg)

If you find this cumbersome, you can directly use [branch\.io](http://branch.io){:target="_blank"} or [Firebase Dynamic](https://firebase.google.com/docs/dynamic-links){:target="_blank"}—there's no need to reinvent the wheel. This approach was taken due to interface customization and some complex requirements, so I had to build it myself.

Users on iOS 9 are already quite rare, so unless absolutely necessary, you can ignore it; using the clipboard method is quick and efficient, and with the clipboard, you don't have to limit the link to be opened in Safari!
