### Things About iOS UUID \(Swift/iOS ‚â• 6\)

iPlayground 2018 is back & things about UUID

### Introduction:

Last Saturday and Sunday, I attended the [iPlayground](https://iplayground.io/){:target="_blank"} Apple Software Developers Conference. A colleague passed the information to me, and I wasn't familiar with the event before going.

Over the two days, the entire event and schedule were smooth, covering the following topics:
1. Fun topics: Bicycles, withering Code, the evolution of iOS/API, Where's Waldo \(CoreML Vision\)
2. Practical topics: Testing types \(XCUITest, Dependency Injection\), alternatives for animations using SpriteKit, GraphQL
3. Real skills: In-depth dissection of Swift, iOS Jailbreaking/Tweak development, Redux

The bicycle project left a deep impression; it used an iPhone as a sensor to detect the rotation of the bicycle pedals, allowing the presenter to ride a bike on stage while switching slides \(the main goal was to create an open-source version of Zwift, and many pitfalls were shared, such as Client/Server communication, latency issues, and magnetic field interference\).

The discussion on withering Dirty Code resonated with me, and I couldn't help but smile; technical debt accumulates this way. When development timelines are tight, poorer architectural choices are made, and subsequent developers don't have time to refactor, leading to more accumulation; eventually, the only option may be to scrap the entire approach.

In the testing section \(Design Patterns in XCUITest\), a [senior from KKBOX](https://www.facebook.com/TestingWithKK/){:target="_blank"} openly shared their methods, code examples, and the pitfalls they encountered along with solutions. This session was the most beneficial for our work; testing is an area I've always wanted to strengthen, and I can go back and study it thoroughly.

During the Lighting Talk, I was eager to share from the audience üòÇ I need to prepare earlier next time!

The official party afterward had great food and drinks, and it was enjoyable to hear the heartfelt insights from the seniors. It was not only relaxed and fun but also a great opportunity to absorb many soft skills for the workplace.

NTU Backstage Cafe

I just learned that this was the first edition, and I feel honored to have participated. Kudos to all the staff and speakers for their hard work!

The purpose of attending the conference is to: **broaden** knowledge, absorb new insights, understand the ecosystem, and encounter topics that are usually not touched upon, as well as **deepen** understanding. For topics I am already familiar with, I attend to see if there are any gaps or alternative approaches I haven't discovered.

I took many notes that I can review and study later.
### Things About UUID

After attending, I immediately applied what I learned to the app; this session was led by senior Zonble, and I was amazed to hear about the journey from iPhone OS 2 to iOS 12. Since I entered the field later, I started writing from iOS 11/Swift 4, so I missed the chaotic period caused by Apple's API changes.

Thinking about it, it's quite reasonable that UUIDs can be obtained and then blocked; if used for good: identifying user devices, advertising, or third-party applications utilizing uniqueness for advertising operations. However, if a vendor intends to do harm, they could use this mechanism to trace back and learn about the owner of the phone \(for example, if someone has travel apps, public transport apps for Taipei, a BMW app, and baby care apps, one could infer that they often travel, have children, and live in Taipei, among other information\). Coupled with personal data entered in apps, the potential applications are unimaginable.

However, this also affects many legitimate users, such as those who originally used UUIDs as decryption keys for user data or for device identification, which have been significantly impacted. I truly admire the engineers from that period; the repercussions would have led to furious complaints from bosses and users, necessitating quick thinking to find alternative solutions.
#### Alternatives:

This article focuses on obtaining UUIDs to identify unique device values. If you're looking for alternatives to find out which apps a user has installed, you can refer to the following keywords for methods: [UIPasteboard pasteboardWithName: create: \(using the clipboard to share between apps\)](https://link.medium.com/YTheNPnHH7){:target="_blank"}, canOpenURL: info\.plist LSApplicationQueriesSchemes \(using canOpenURL to check if an app is installed, which must be listed in info\.plist, with a maximum of 50 entries\).
1. Using MAC Address as UUID, but that was later banned.
2. [Finger Printing \(Canvas/User-Agent‚Ä¶\)](https://medium.com/@ravielakshmanan/web-browser-uniqueness-and-fingerprinting-7eac3c381805){:target="_blank"}: I haven't researched this, but this method is mainly used to generate the same UUID for Safari and apps, [Deferred Deep Linking](https://www.jianshu.com/p/fa48387d56ea){:target="_blank"} \(for delayed deep linking\) uses [AmIUnique?](https://amiunique.org/){:target="_blank"}.
3. [**ID** entifier **F** or **V** endor](https://www.jianshu.com/p/b810d7e007ad){:target="_blank"} \(IDFV\): Currently the mainstream solution üèÜ
The concept is that Apple generates a UUID for users based on your Bundle ID prefix. The same Bundle ID prefix will generate the same UUID; for example: com\.518\.work/com\.518\.job will yield the same UUID on the same device.
As stated in the original text, ID For Vendor, Apple considers apps with the same prefix to be from the same vendor, so sharing UUIDs is permitted.

#### **ID** entifier **F** or **V** endor \(IDFV\):
```swift
let DEVICE_UUID:String = UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString ?? UUID().uuidString
```

**Note: When all apps from the same vendor are removed and then reinstalled, a new UUID will be generated \(** if both com\.518\.work and com\.518\.job are deleted, reinstalling com\.518\.work will generate a new UUID **\)** 
**Similarly, if you only have one app, deleting and reinstalling it will generate a new UUID.**

Due to this characteristic, our company's other apps use Key-Chain to resolve this issue. The insights from the speaker confirmed that this approach is correct!

**The process is as follows:**

![Key-Chain UUID field retrieves value if present; if not, retrieves IDFA's UUID value and writes back](/assets/a4bc3bce7513/1*-8rufG1QW-J5tn6ZadT17A.jpeg)

Key-Chain UUID field retrieves value if present; if not, retrieves IDFA's UUID value and writes back.

Key-Chain writing method:
```swift
if let data = DEVICE_UUID.data(using: .utf8) {
    let query = [
        kSecClass as String       : kSecClassGenericPassword as String,
        kSecAttrAccount as String : "DEVICE_UUID",
        kSecValueData as String   : data ] as [String : Any]
    
    SecItemDelete(query as CFDictionary)
    SecItemAdd(query as CFDictionary, nil)
}
```

Key-Chain reading method:
```swift
let query = [
    kSecClass as String       : kSecClassGenericPassword,
    kSecAttrAccount as String : "DEVICE_UUID",
    kSecReturnData as String  : kCFBooleanTrue,
    kSecMatchLimit as String  : kSecMatchLimitOne ] as [String : Any]

var dataTypeRef: AnyObject? = nil
let status: OSStatus = SecItemCopyMatching(query as CFDictionary, &dataTypeRef)
if status == noErr, let dataTypeRef = dataTypeRef as? Data, let uuid = String(data:dataTypeRef, encoding: .utf8) {
   //uuid
} 
```

If you find Key-Chain operations too cumbersome, you can encapsulate them or use third-party libraries.
#### Complete CODE:
```swift
let DEVICE_UUID:String = {
    let query = [
        kSecClass as String       : kSecClassGenericPassword,
        kSecAttrAccount as String : "DEVICE_UUID",
        kSecReturnData as String  : kCFBooleanTrue,
        kSecMatchLimit as String  : kSecMatchLimitOne ] as [String : Any]
    
    var dataTypeRef: AnyObject? = nil
    let status: OSStatus = SecItemCopyMatching(query as CFDictionary, &dataTypeRef)
    if status == noErr, let dataTypeRef = dataTypeRef as? Data, let uuid = String(data:dataTypeRef, encoding: .utf8) {
        return uuid
    } else {
        let DEVICE_UUID:String = UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString ?? UUID().uuidString
        if let data = DEVICE_UUID.data(using: .utf8) {
            let query = [
                kSecClass as String       : kSecClassGenericPassword as String,
                kSecAttrAccount as String : "DEVICE_UUID",
                kSecValueData as String   : data ] as [String : Any]
        
            SecItemDelete(query as CFDictionary)
            SecItemAdd(query as CFDictionary, nil)
        }
        return DEVICE_UUID
    }
}()
```

Since I need to reference this in other Extension Targets, I directly packaged it into a closure for use.
