### The Essentials of iOS UUID \(Swift/iOS ‚â• 6\)

iPlayground 2018 Returns & The Essentials of UUID

### Introduction:

Last Saturday and Sunday, I attended the [iPlayground](https://iplayground.io/){:target="_blank"} Apple Software Developer Conference. A colleague passed the information about this event to me, and I wasn't familiar with it before attending.

Over the two days, the entire event and schedule flowed smoothly. The agenda included:
1. Fun topics: Bicycles, Decaying Code, the Evolution of iOS/API, Where's Waldo \(CoreML Vision\)
2. Practical topics: Testing types \(XCUITest, Dependency Injection\), Alternatives for Animations with SpriteKit, GraphQL
3. Real skills: In-depth breakdown of Swift, iOS Jailbreaking/Tweak Development, Redux

The bicycle project left a strong impression; it used an iPhone as a sensor to detect the rotation of bicycle pedals, allowing the presenter to ride a bike on stage while switching slides \(the main goal was to create an open-source version of Zwift, and many pitfalls were shared, such as Client/Server communication, latency issues, and magnetic field interference\).

The discussion on Decaying Dirty Code resonated with me, and I couldn't help but smile inwardly; technical debt accumulates this way. When development timelines are tight, quick but poorly structured solutions are used, and subsequent developers lack the time to refactor, leading to even more accumulation. Eventually, the only option may be to scrap that path entirely.

In the testing segment \(Design Patterns in XCUITest\), a [senior from KKBOX](https://www.facebook.com/TestingWithKK/){:target="_blank"} openly shared their methods, code examples, and the pitfalls they encountered along with solutions. This session was the most beneficial for our work; testing is an area I've always wanted to strengthen, and I can go back and study it thoroughly.

During the Lighting Talk segment, I was eager to share my thoughts as well üòÇ. Next time, I need to prepare in advance!

The official party afterward had great food and drinks, and it was enjoyable to hear the heartfelt insights from the seniors. It was not only relaxing and fun but also a great opportunity to absorb many soft skills for the workplace.

NTU Backstage Cafe

I just learned that this was the first edition, and I feel honored to have participated. Kudos to all the staff and speakers for their hard work!

The purpose of attending a conference is to: **broaden** one's horizons by absorbing new knowledge, understanding the ecosystem, and encountering topics that one usually wouldn't, as well as **deepening** one's understanding. For topics I've already explored, I aim to see if I've missed anything or discover alternative approaches.

I took many notes that I can review and study later.
### The Essentials of UUID

After attending, I immediately applied what I learned to my app; this session was led by senior Zonble, and I was amazed to hear about the journey from iPhone OS 2 to iOS 12. Since I entered the field later, I started writing from iOS 11/Swift 4, so I missed the chaotic period caused by Apple's API changes.

Thinking about it, it's quite reasonable that UUIDs can be obtained and then blocked; if used for good: identifying user devices, advertising, or third-party applications leveraging uniqueness for advertising operations. However, if a vendor intends to do harm, they could use this mechanism to backtrack and learn about the device owner. \(For example, if someone has travel apps, Taipei bus apps, BMW apps, and baby care apps, it could be inferred that they often travel, have children, and live in Taipei, among other information\). Coupled with personal data entered in apps, the potential applications are unimaginable.

However, this also affects many law-abiding users, such as those who originally used UUIDs as decryption keys for user data or for device identification, which have been significantly impacted. I truly admire the engineers from that period; the repercussions would surely lead to frustration from both bosses and users, necessitating quick thinking to find alternative solutions.
#### Alternatives:

This article focuses on obtaining a UUID to identify a device uniquely. If you're looking for alternatives to find out which apps a user has installed, you can refer to the following keywords for methods: [UIPasteboard pasteboardWithName: create: \(Using the clipboard to share between apps\)](https://link.medium.com/YTheNPnHH7){:target="_blank"}, canOpenURL: info\.plist LSApplicationQueriesSchemes \(Using canOpenURL to check if an app is installed, which must be listed in info\.plist, with a maximum of 50 entries\).
1. Using MAC Address as UUID, but that was later banned.
2. [Finger Printing \(Canvas/User-Agent‚Ä¶\)](https://medium.com/@ravielakshmanan/web-browser-uniqueness-and-fingerprinting-7eac3c381805){:target="_blank"}: I haven't researched this, but this method is mainly used to generate the same UUID for Safari and apps, [Deferred Deep Linking](https://www.jianshu.com/p/fa48387d56ea){:target="_blank"} \(for delayed deep linking\) using [AmIUnique?](https://amiunique.org/){:target="_blank"}.
3. [**ID** entifier **F** or **V** endor](https://www.jianshu.com/p/b810d7e007ad){:target="_blank"} \(IDFV\): Currently the mainstream solution üèÜ. The concept is that Apple generates a UUID for users based on your Bundle ID prefix. The same Bundle ID prefix will generate the same UUID; for example: com\.518\.work/com\.518\.job will yield the same UUID on the same device. As per the original ID For Vendor, Apple considers apps with the same prefix to be from the same vendor, so sharing UUIDs is permitted.

#### **ID** entifier **F** or **V** endor \(IDFV\):
```swift
let DEVICE_UUID:String = UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString ?? UUID().uuidString
```

**Note: When all apps from the same vendor are removed and then reinstalled, a new UUID will be generated \(** if both com\.518\.work and com\.518\.job are deleted, reinstalling com\.518\.work will generate a new UUID **\)**. Similarly, if you only have one app, deleting and reinstalling it will also generate a new UUID.**

Due to this characteristic, our company's other apps use Key-Chain to resolve this issue. The insights from the speaker confirmed that this approach is indeed correct!

**The process is as follows:**

![Key-Chain UUID field retrieves value if present; if not, it retrieves IDFA's UUID value and writes it back](/assets/a4bc3bce7513/1*-8rufG1QW-J5tn6ZadT17A.jpeg)

Key-Chain UUID field retrieves value if present; if not, it retrieves IDFA's UUID value and writes it back.

Key-Chain writing method:
```swift
if let data = DEVICE_UUID.data(using: .utf8) {
    let query = [
        kSecClass as String       : kSecClassGenericPassword as String,
        kSecAttrAccount as String : "DEVICE_UUID",
        kSecValueData as String   : data ] as [String : Any]
    
    SecItemDelete(query as CFDictionary)
    SecItemAdd(query as CFDictionary, nil)
}
```

Key-Chain reading method:
```swift
let query = [
    kSecClass as String       : kSecClassGenericPassword,
    kSecAttrAccount as String : "DEVICE_UUID",
    kSecReturnData as String  : kCFBooleanTrue,
    kSecMatchLimit as String  : kSecMatchLimitOne ] as [String : Any]

var dataTypeRef: AnyObject? = nil
let status: OSStatus = SecItemCopyMatching(query as CFDictionary, &dataTypeRef)
if status == noErr, let dataTypeRef = dataTypeRef as? Data, let uuid = String(data:dataTypeRef, encoding: .utf8) {
   //uuid
} 
```

If you find Key-Chain operations too cumbersome, you can encapsulate them or use third-party libraries.
#### Complete CODE:
```swift
let DEVICE_UUID:String = {
    let query = [
        kSecClass as String       : kSecClassGenericPassword,
        kSecAttrAccount as String : "DEVICE_UUID",
        kSecReturnData as String  : kCFBooleanTrue,
        kSecMatchLimit as String  : kSecMatchLimitOne ] as [String : Any]
    
    var dataTypeRef: AnyObject? = nil
    let status: OSStatus = SecItemCopyMatching(query as CFDictionary, &dataTypeRef)
    if status == noErr, let dataTypeRef = dataTypeRef as? Data, let uuid = String(data:dataTypeRef, encoding: .utf8) {
        return uuid
    } else {
        let DEVICE_UUID:String = UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString ?? UUID().uuidString
        if let data = DEVICE_UUID.data(using: .utf8) {
            let query = [
                kSecClass as String       : kSecClassGenericPassword as String,
                kSecAttrAccount as String : "DEVICE_UUID",
                kSecValueData as String   : data ] as [String : Any]
        
            SecItemDelete(query as CFDictionary)
            SecItemAdd(query as CFDictionary, nil)
        }
        return DEVICE_UUID
    }
}()
```

Since I need to reference this in other Extension Targets, I directly packaged it into a closure for use.
