### Bye Bye 2020 Review of Running Medium in the Second Year

### A Difficult Year

Unrelated to work, 2020 was a tough year for me; I went through many major setbacks, but fortunately, I got through them all.

I just want to say one thing:

> People need to learn to cherish the present and appreciate what they have.

### Work

Back to work, in 2020 I stepped out of my comfort zone into a new environment; this exposed me to many new experiences and allowed me to absorb a lot of valuable knowledge in iOS and engineering development. Although the number of articles I wrote in 2020 was less than before, and I even stopped updating for three to four months, I focused on quality over quantity. The fewer articles I wrote in 2020 actually performed better than previous ones; I am gradually improving!

Additionally, last year I created a personal website using Google Sites and continuously sync new Medium articles there.

### Original Intention

I am still myself—I am a lazy person; I don't write articles just for the sake of writing. Each article is based on some insights I have developed and then immediately recorded. If I get lazy and don't do it all at once, I probably won't bother going back to write it later (though this usually happens only with unimportant or uninteresting topics).

The downside is that sometimes I get too eager and write too fast. Typos are minor, but if the content is wrong or incomplete and misleads readers, that's truly a sin. Orz; so this year, when writing articles, I will research and address all the issues I can think of and handle, even if they weren't used in the original project. If something can't be resolved, I'll leave a note to remind readers to pay attention to that aspect.

#### Chrome Extensions Used for Writing Articles

- **Recommend again [Code Medium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-medium/dganoageikmadjocbmklfgaejpkdigbe){:target="_blank"}** This lets you directly use Gist to embed beautiful code within Medium!

After installation, click the "+" on Medium, then select the last option "<>"

![](/assets/5ea3311119d8/1*dhLr-LydWl6vuvcA9P9UNw.png)

At this point, the screen will split into left and right sections, allowing you to enter code directly on the right side:

After submission, it will be directly embedded as a gist in the Medium article:

The advantage of using gist to embed code is that it supports syntax highlighting, making it easier for readers to read; the downside is that when converting Medium articles to markdown format, the embedded code cannot be automatically converted and must be manually copied and pasted.

> *- I have tried many conversion tools, but none support gist extraction. If anyone knows, please kindly share.*

> *- Medium's built-in code blocks still do not support syntax highlighting, so this is the best we can do.*

Daily traffic aggregation display lets you see today's traffic article composition at a glance.

There are also features for tracking new followers, claps, and more.

### Goals for This Year

#### Backup Plan

Besides continuing to write, I plan to find time to convert each article into Markdown format and upload them to Github for backup, in case Medium suddenly crashes one day... Currently, I am using the [Typora](http://typora.io/){:target="_blank"} editor; it's quite user-friendly. I'll introduce it later!

![[Typora](http://typora.io/){:target="_blank"}](/assets/5ea3311119d8/1*zbgIDgPkq36aU01YSrNGvg.png)

[Typora](http://typora.io/){:target="_blank"}

The current progress is about 15%. Feeling a bit lazy because it's boring, haha.

> *The official Medium backup download only saves plain text; images remain externally linked and are not downloaded. Moreover, code sections are embedded and cannot be directly displayed in Markdown.*

#### Independent Domain

It has been deployed. Please refer to "[Medium Custom Domain Feature Returns](../d9a95d4224ea/)".

- Profile page: [blog.zhgchg.li](http://blog.zhgchg.li/){:target="_blank"} (I only use the subdomain `blog.zhgchg.li` because the main domain serves other purposes)

However, I found it affects Google SEO, so I am still considering and testing whether to actually use it.

#### Buy Me A Coffee!

Recently, the following services have also been launched:

- [Buy Me A Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/zhgchgli){:target="_blank"}

- [Appreciate Citizens](https://liker.land/zhgchgli/civic){:target="_blank"}

![Anyway, I'm free](/assets/5ea3311119d8/1*CkHby264C3AC5ixNj8qIrw.png)

Anyway, I have a lot of free time.

### Statistics

Finally, let's do some statistics!

In 2020, a total of:  
**16** articles were published: **3** lifestyle + **2** unboxing + **11** technical articles

#### Total site accumulation until 2021/02/24:
