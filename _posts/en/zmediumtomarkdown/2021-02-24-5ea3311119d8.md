### Bye Bye 2020: A Review of My Second Year on Medium

A belated review of 2020

### A Challenging Year

Aside from work, 2020 was a challenging year for me; I experienced many significant setbacks, but thankfully, I made it through.

I just want to say one thing:


> One must learn to cherish the present and appreciate what one has. 



### Work

Returning to work, 2020 pushed me out of my comfort zone into a new environment; it allowed me to encounter many new things and absorb a lot of insights in iOS and engineering development. Although my output in 2020 was less than before, and I even stopped updating for three to four months, the quality over quantity approach meant that the articles I wrote in 2020, though fewer, actually performed better than before; I am gradually improving!

Additionally, last year I set up my personal website using Google Sites; I will continue to synchronize new article updates from Medium there.

### Original Intention

I am still the same person; I am quite lazy; I don’t write just for the sake of writing. Each article is a result of my reflections that I immediately jot down. If I get lazy and don’t do it all at once, I probably won’t feel motivated to go back and write (though this usually happens with topics that are not important or interesting).

The downside is that sometimes I get too enthusiastic and write too quickly; typos are minor, but if the content is incorrect or misleading, that would be a sin Orz. Therefore, this year, while writing articles, I will research and address any issues I can think of, even if I didn’t encounter them in the original project; even if I can’t address them, I will leave a note to remind readers to pay attention to that aspect.
#### Chrome Extensions Used for Writing Articles
- **Once again, I recommend [Code Medium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-medium/dganoageikmadjocbmklfgaejpkdigbe){:target="_blank"}**. This allows you to use Gist to embed beautiful code directly in Medium!


After installation, click the “+” on Medium and select the last option “&lt;&gt;”

At this point, the screen will be split into two, and you can directly input code on the right side:

After submission, it will be embedded directly into the Medium article as a gist:

The benefit of using gist to embed code is that it supports color highlighting, making it easier for readers to read; the downside is that if you want to convert Medium to markdown format, the embedded code cannot be automatically converted, and you have to manually copy and paste.


> _\- I have tried many conversion tools that do not support gist extraction; if anyone knows of any, please share._ 
 

> _\- The built-in code block in Medium still does not support color highlighting, so this is the only way._

Daily traffic aggregation display, allowing a quick glance at today's traffic article composition.

Additionally, there are statistics for new followers, claps, and other features.
### Goals for This Year
#### Backup Plan

In addition to continuing to write; I plan to find some time to convert each article into Markdown format and upload it to GitHub for backup, in case Medium suddenly goes down one day... Currently, I am using [Typora](http://typora.io/){:target="_blank"} as the editor; it's quite user-friendly, and I will introduce it later!

The current progress is about 15%, and I'm a bit lazy because it's quite boring, haha.

> _The official Medium backup download only backs up plain text; images are still linked externally and not downloaded; moreover, the code parts are embedded and cannot be displayed directly in Markdown._

#### Custom Domain

It has already been deployed, please refer to "[Medium Custom Domain Feature Returns](../d9a95d4224ea/)".
- Profile page: [blog\.zhgchg\.li](http://blog.zhgchg.li/){:target="_blank"} (I only use the subdomain `blog.zhgchg.li`, as the main domain has other purposes)

However, I found that it affects Google SEO, and I am still considering and testing whether to really use it.
#### Buy Me A Coffee!

Recently, I have also launched the following services:
- [Buy Me A Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/zhgchgli){:target="_blank"}
- [Civic Appreciation](https://liker.land/zhgchgli/civic){:target="_blank"}

### Statistics

Finally, let's have some statistics!

In 2020, I published a total of:
**16** articles: **3** lifestyle + **2** unboxings + **11** technical articles
#### Total as of 2021/02/24:
- Total views of all articles: **180,000** times (growth of 2 times)
- Total claps for all articles: **11,000** times (growth of 1 time)
- Followers: Surpassed 400 (growth of 1 time)

#### Articles with better performance include:
- [iOS UIViewController Transition Matters](../14cee137c565/)
- [First Experience with iOS Reverse Engineering](../7498e1ff93ce/)
- [iOS 14 Clipboard Data Theft Panic, The Dilemma of Privacy and Convenience](../8a04443024e2/)
- [Apple Watch Series 6 Unboxing & Two-Year Usage Experience](../eab0e984043/)
- [Easily Create "Pseudo" Perspective Transparent Phone Wallpaper Using iPhone](../2e4429f410d6/)

> _Thanks to everyone for your support and care in 2020; I will continue to work hard this year!_
