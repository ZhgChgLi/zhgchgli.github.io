### \[Productivity Tools\] Abandoning Chrome for the Embrace of Sidekick Browser

Introduction and insights on Sidekick Browser

### 2024 Update

Around early 2023, I switched to using the [Arc Browser!](https://arc.net/gift/f86ef8b3){:target="_blank"} The experience and features are better, with fewer bugs, and it supports cross-computer synchronization.

Here’s a link to download Arc, the browser I was telling you about!

### Introduction

I learned about the Sidekick Browser from a colleague's sharing; to be honest, I didn't have high expectations at first. Over the years, I have often thought about abandoning Chrome and have tried using Safari, the beta version of Safari, Firefox, Opera, and third-party browsers developed on open-source cores, but I repeatedly failed and ended up reinstalling Chrome within a few days. Another reason is that I haven't actively followed the browser market; perhaps there has long been a browser that meets my needs, but I just didn't know about it.

#### Reasons for Failure

The main reason is that the extensions I commonly use cannot be fully supported. I have become too reliant on and accustomed to Chrome's extensions. Additionally, even if a Chromium-based core can support them without issues, there are no particularly standout features, making the experience similar to using Google Chrome.

#### My Requirements
- Chromium core, to support my commonly used extensions
- More unique features to help enhance productivity
- Support for MacOS; I am used to using Safari on iOS, so I do not require cross-device support
- Excellent memory management
- Enhanced privacy and anti-tracking
- Seamless migration features

Regarding productivity features, there are millions of tools available as Chrome extensions, and searching and combining them can achieve results. However, we haven't conducted research, and to be honest, I'm not very clear on what processes and features are helpful for productivity.

Here is the translated text while preserving the original Markdown format:

What catches the eye is the Sidekick introduction page. Click "Continue" at the top to proceed.

Use Google, Microsoft, or create a Sidekick account directly; this account is for the Sidekick service and is unrelated to Google or Microsoft.

⬇️⬇️⬇️ If you are transitioning from Chrome to Sidekick, **please read this section completely before continuing to create an account** ⬇️⬇️⬇️

> _Unlike Chrome, where the login account is directly linked and syncs the browser data from the Google account after installation; **you will find that after logging into Sidekick, no data has been imported. The reason is that [Google currently blocks all third-party services from accessing sync features](https://help.meetsidekick.com/en/articles/5224854-synchronisation-issues){:target="_blank"}, so Sidekick cannot sync or import data directly through the account.**_

![Personnel data cannot sync Google account information](/assets/118e924a1477/1*mwF0s6KNZGYOX65EHGtUXA.png)

Personnel data cannot sync Google account information.

![Sidekick sync settings, only the pitiful search terms are synced](/assets/118e924a1477/1*24LXqcP6raSLufNqU4k6ew.png)

Sidekick sync settings, only the pitiful search terms are synced.

#### So how do you import Chrome data?

The official method is quite roundabout, but for now, this is the only way.

If you are already a Chrome user, you can skip steps 1-3.
1. Download & install Chrome.
2. Log into Chrome.
3. Complete the sync of browser data from your Google account to Chrome.
4. **Completely close Chrome \( \! Important \! Please ensure there are no small dots under the Chrome icon in the Dock for MacOS users\)**
5. Continue with the previous step to create an account.
6. After creating the account for the first time, it will ask you from which browser to import data.
7. Select Chrome.
8. Wait for the import to complete.

After the import is complete, all bookmarks, browsing history, saved passwords, logged-in website sessions, and extensions will be seamlessly transferred to Sidekick; only a few services will require you to log in again, while the rest will not, making it a painless transition!

> _There is a small issue here, which is that if you do not create a new account (e.g., reinstall), you can only transfer bookmarks, browsing history, and saved passwords; extensions cannot be automatically imported. [According to the official Q&A, you can only reinstall from the Chrome extension/app store](https://help.meetsidekick.com/en/articles/4145356-general-faqs){:target="_blank"}._ 

#### Sync Issues?

Since Google has blocked third-party access to cloud data, how can we solve the bookmark cross-device sync issue?

[Sidekick will soon release Sidekick Sync to address this problem](https://help.meetsidekick.com/en/articles/5224854-synchronisation-issues){:target="_blank"}.

> This article uses my personal computer, not for office use; therefore, it may include social entertainment websites, please forgive me.

### Featured Features
#### Painless Transfer

As mentioned in the installation steps, after opening for the first time, creating an account, and logging in, you can seamlessly transfer all bookmarks, browsing history, saved passwords, logged-in website sessions, and extensions from existing Safari, Chrome, or Edge.

I believe the logged-in website sessions and extensions provide the best experience; previous browsers only transferred bookmarks, but all websites required re-login, and all extensions had to be reinstalled, which was very patience-consuming.

#### Powerful Homepage Functionality

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*5U5Pk45aHMgBsSqZjB4cXg.png)

Unlike Chrome's monotonous homepage, which requires effort to find a homepage solution, Sidekick comes with a beautiful and convenient homepage feature.
- The search box can search browsing history and bookmarks; if there are no search results, it automatically becomes a Google search.
- The top left displays data on anti-tracking, memory management, and ad-blocking status.
- Displays today's date and current time.
- The top section is referred to as Tabs, while the upper part of the left toolbar is called Applications.
- The homepage background image can be customized or automatically display scenic images.

#### Application Functionality

Not just a quick entry to websites, it operates similarly to MacOS's Dock. When the Application website is activated, it will remain in the browser (with a small dot on the left) while also managing memory effectively; if there are notifications from the website while activated, it will mark a number as a reminder.

```markdown
![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*hN5uieaQBJv1p9iTnwyDFw.png)

The Application can be quickly added from the homepage, or you can create it from the Tab or manually input the URL and ICON image.

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*vJxqus1O5taM-AkSEDRh-w.png)

Sidekick has built-in hundreds of productivity tool websites that can be quickly added to the Application.

> _If the Application does not appear in the left Sidebar after being added from the homepage, you can drag it over manually._

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*jeCSiX0FXtll-IgBM4JDnw.jpeg)

Right-clicking on the Application allows you to quickly view your recent browsing history, and it also supports multi-account switching.

> _There are not many websites that support multi-account switching; for those that do not, you can use Private Mode (incognito mode) instead; currently, Slack and Notion have been tested and both support it._

- The left Application and the top Tab do not affect each other; the Application area is independent and will not appear in the top Tab.

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*EXC0AJpQOXBPCD7RB6XTpg.jpeg)

Each App can be individually configured, such as turning off notifications, disabling badges, etc.

#### Window Splitting Feature

Although MacOS has a built-in window splitting feature, I actually use it very rarely; unless I want to fully focus, more often I need to compare web content while using other MacOS Apps, and at that time, the pure browser's split window feature is very useful!

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*Y5_ESbe7KRLu3OjweqNZuw.jpeg)

For example, this way you can attend an online class and take notes at the same time.

The size of the middle separator can be freely dragged and adjusted.

To use it, simply click the split window button in the upper right corner of the browser, select the window you want to add to the left, and click again to close the split.

#### Spotlight Feature

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*B60RpU-WptmbOuUaA3kW3Q.png)

Similar to MacOS's Spotlight, you can press "Option" + "f" for a full browser search in any window.
- You can use "Option" + "z" or "Control" + "tab" for quick Tab switching.
- "Option" + "1–9" quickly switches to Tab positions 1~9.

#### Tab Saver (Save Sessions) Feature

Similar to the popular Tab Saver extension on Chrome, it allows you to quickly save the currently opened Tab pages and switch between them, making it easier to manage different work states.

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*_zGwKwCvGG_xVZE9G0yPLg.jpeg)

Click the "F" (First Session) in the lower left corner to enter the Session management page.

Click "Add new session" at the top to save the current Tab state and open a new clean browsing environment.

You can switch between Sessions, and click "Activate" to restore the Tabs.

> _Sessions do not affect the Applications that are currently enabled on the left._

- You can use the shortcut "Option" + "W" for quick Session switching.
- "Option" + "⬆️" + "W" for Session management.

#### Excellent Application Notification Feature

In fact, starting now, as long as there is a web version of the communication service, you can directly use the Sidekick Application without needing to install a special desktop application; as mentioned earlier, the notification feature of the Application is just like that of a desktop application, providing real-time and complete notifications.

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*I_BXx4y_m4isFs3bz_yNkg.png)

- Remember to authorize Sidekick to send desktop notifications; this way, web notifications will pop up on your computer.

#### Note-taking Feature

It has a built-in integration with Google Keep cloud note-taking functionality. Click the document Icon in the lower left corner to quickly open Google Keep for note-taking.

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*PnXdiHp2mmuC62Iq-I1O2w.jpeg)

Google Keep is stored in the cloud under your Google account, supporting cross-platform and cross-device note synchronization.

You can use this feature to quickly record tasks.

> **_Not sure if it will change to its own Sidekick Sync in the future, as this would allow for optimization and integration._**

- You can use the shortcut "Option" + "N" for quick Session switching.
```

#### Built-in Anti-Tracking and Ad-Blocking, Memory Management Features

With the surge of privacy concerns, major companies are gradually starting to pay attention to user privacy, with Apple being the primary leader. The new version of Safari has also begun to incorporate privacy protection features; however, as the biggest beneficiary of privacy information, Google Ads, I think it will be difficult to see changes on Google Chrome.

> _Chromium != Chrome; Chromium is an open-source project that serves as the core technology for browsers._

Although Chromium is also led by Google, its open-source nature allows any developer to optimize based on this core. Sidekick also uses this method to optimize on the basis of Chromium, retaining the features of Chrome while enhancing the functionalities that Chrome lacks.

#### Details
- For dual-screen users, you can also pull tabs into independent windows; independent windows will not have the toolbar on the left.
- [Supports all Chrome extensions, which can be downloaded and installed directly from the store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore?hl=zh-TW){:target="_blank"}

> _More features await your exploration and experience!_

### Costs

> "It is a sin for a business not to make money (if you do not make money, it is a sin against society, because we take society's funds and talents; without sufficient surplus, we are wasting precious resources that could be used more effectively elsewhere.)" - Panasonic Founder — Konosuke Matsushita (Text reference from Business Thinking Academy)

A good product must have good cash flow to provide better services and sustain itself longer; here are the pricing details for Sidekick:

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*QO099z26UL-QMdKmkaKgpg.png)

For personal use, the free plan is more than sufficient, but if you have the means, consider supporting the development team!
- Currently, all users who have joined are part of the Early Access plan, seemingly unaffected by the Free plan (I have more than 5 Sidebar apps and it’s fine).
- There is a plan to invite 10 users for 6 months of Pro / invite 20 users for lifetime Pro; so friends who like this article can download and install through [the link in the text to support me and Sidekick!](https://join.meetsidekick.com/pokbg){:target="_blank"}

### Summary of Experience

After using it for a while, due to the seamless transition, I have completely abandoned Chrome, and there is nothing that I absolutely need to go back to Chrome for. The best feature is still the Applications on the left, where I can add frequently used websites for quick switching and to receive the latest notifications.

In the past, I would often get lost in a chaotic array of tabs or could only use the Pin Tab method to keep important work services pinned at the front; but switching was still painful as I had to search for them.

Now, when I need to do a Code Review, I just click on GitHub; when I need to submit an app, I click on App Store Connect; when I want to check a project, I click on Asana. It’s very efficient for work.

Regarding memory management, I haven’t done specific research or testing; I’m not quite sure about the optimization effects, but having it is better than not having it.

> **_The only concern is that this product is still too new, and I’m not sure how far it can go; if it fails to operate well, development and maintenance might stop, which would be a great pity! So please promote and support it vigorously!_**
