### \[Productivity Tools\] Embracing the Sidekick Browser Over Chrome

An introduction to the features and my experience with the Sidekick browser.

### 2024 Update

Around early 2023, I switched to using the [Arc browser](https://arc.net/gift/f86ef8b3){:target="_blank"}! The experience and features are better, there are fewer bugs, and it supports cross-computer synchronization.

Here’s a link to download Arc, the browser I was telling you about!

### Introduction

I learned about the Sidekick browser from a colleague's recommendation. Honestly, I didn't have high expectations at first. Over the years, I’ve often thought about abandoning Chrome and have tried using Safari, the beta version of Safari, Firefox, Opera, and various third-party browsers based on open-source cores, but I always ended up returning to Chrome within a few days. One reason for this is that I haven't actively followed the browser market; perhaps there are already browsers that meet my needs, but I just didn't know about them.

#### Reasons for Failure

The main reason is that many of my frequently used extensions are not fully supported. I have become too reliant on and accustomed to Chrome's extensions. Even if a Chromium-based browser can support them without issues, the features often lack standout qualities, making the experience similar to using Google Chrome.

#### My Requirements
- Chromium core, to support my frequently used extensions
- More unique features to enhance productivity
- Support for macOS; I prefer using Safari on iOS, so cross-device support isn't necessary
- Excellent memory management
- Enhanced privacy and anti-tracking features
- Seamless migration capabilities

Regarding productivity features, Chrome has millions of extensions available, and I could achieve results by searching and combining them. However, we haven't conducted any research, so I'm not entirely sure which processes and features are truly beneficial for productivity.

- Open Sidekick

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*5Up0RxyfddsPeQistL2kQA.jpeg)

Upon opening, you'll see the Sidekick introduction page. Click "Continue" to proceed.

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*NauUZEY2vfGsVncUhc6hrA.jpeg)

You can sign in using Google, Microsoft, or create a Sidekick account directly. This account is specifically for Sidekick services and is not linked to Google or Microsoft.

⬇️⬇️⬇️ If you're transitioning from Chrome to Sidekick, **please read this section before creating your account** ⬇️⬇️⬇️

> _Unlike Chrome, where your login account is directly linked and syncs browser data from your Google account, **you'll find that after logging into Sidekick, no data is imported. This is because [Google currently blocks all third-party services from accessing synchronization features](https://help.meetsidekick.com/en/articles/5224854-synchronisation-issues){:target="_blank"}, so Sidekick cannot sync or import data directly through your account.**_

![User data cannot sync with Google account](/assets/118e924a1477/1*mwF0s6KNZGYOX65EHGtUXA.png)

User data cannot sync with Google account.

Sidekick sync settings, only pathetic search term sync.

#### How to Import Chrome Data?

The official method is quite convoluted, but it's currently the only way.

If you are already a Chrome user, you can skip steps 1-3.
1. Download and install Chrome.
2. Sign in to Chrome.
3. Complete the synchronization of your Google account's browser data to Chrome.
4. **Completely close Chrome ( \! Important \! For macOS users, please ensure there are no small dots under the Chrome icon in the Dock)**
5. Continue with the account creation from the previous step.
6. After creating your account for the first time, you will be asked which browser you want to import data from.
7. Select Chrome.
8. Wait for the import to complete.

Once the import is finished, all bookmarks, browsing history, saved passwords, logged-in website sessions, and extensions will be seamlessly transferred to Sidekick; only a few services may require you to log in again, but most will not, making it a painless transition!

> _There is a small issue here: if you do not create a new account (e.g., reinstalling), you can only import bookmarks, browsing history, and saved passwords; extensions cannot be automatically imported. [According to the official Q&A, you will need to reinstall them from the Chrome extension/app store](https://help.meetsidekick.com/en/articles/4145356-general-faqs){:target="_blank"}._ 

#### Sync Issues?

Since Google has blocked third-party access to cloud data, how can we solve the bookmark synchronization issue across devices?

[Sidekick will soon release Sidekick Sync to address this issue](https://help.meetsidekick.com/en/articles/5224854-synchronisation-issues){:target="_blank"}.

> This article uses my personal computer, not for work; therefore, it may include social and entertainment websites, please bear with me.

### Featured Features
#### Seamless Migration

As mentioned in the installation steps, after the first installation, opening and creating an account allows you to seamlessly transfer all bookmarks, browsing history, saved passwords, logged-in website sessions, and extensions from existing browsers like Safari, Chrome, or Edge.

The logged-in website sessions and extensions provide the best experience; previous browsers only transferred bookmarks, requiring you to log in to all websites and reinstall all extensions, which can be very frustrating.

#### Powerful Homepage Features

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*5U5Pk45aHMgBsSqZjB4cXg.png)

Unlike Chrome's monotonous homepage, Sidekick comes with a beautiful and convenient homepage feature without needing to search for a solution.
- The search box can search browsing history and bookmarks; if there are no results, it automatically defaults to Google search.
- Displays data on anti-tracking, memory management, and ad-blocking in the upper left corner.
- Shows today's date and current time.
- The upper section is referred to as Tabs, while the upper left tool bar is called Applications.
- The homepage background can be customized or automatically display scenic images.

#### Application Feature

Not just a quick access point for websites, the Application feature works similarly to macOS's Dock. When a website is activated, it stays in the browser (indicated by a small dot on the left) while also managing memory effectively; if the website has notifications, it will display a numerical reminder.

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*hN5uieaQBJv1p9iTnwyDFw.png)

Applications can be quickly added from the homepage or created from Tabs by manually entering URLs or icons.

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*vJxqus1O5taM-AkSEDRh-w.png)

Sidekick has built-in hundreds of productivity tool websites that can be quickly added to Applications.

> _If an Application added from the homepage does not appear in the left sidebar, you can drag it over yourself._

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*jeCSiX0FXtll-IgBM4JDnw.jpeg)

Right-clicking on an Application allows you to quickly view recent browsing history, and it also supports multiple account switching.

> _Not many websites support multiple account switching; if not supported, you can use Private Mode (Incognito Mode); currently, Slack and Notion have been tested and support this feature._

- The left Application and the upper Tabs do not interfere with each other; the Application section is independent and will not appear in the upper Tabs.

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*EXC0AJpQOXBPCD7RB6XTpg.jpeg)

Each App can be individually configured, such as turning off notifications or badges, etc.

#### Split Window Feature

Although macOS has a built-in split window feature, I rarely use it; unless I want to focus completely, I often need to compare web content while using other macOS apps. In such cases, the pure browser split window feature is very useful!

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*Y5_ESbe7KRLu3OjweqNZuw.jpeg)

For example, you can attend an online class and take notes simultaneously.

The size of the split can be freely adjusted by dragging.

To use it, simply click the split window button in the upper right corner of the browser and select the window you want to add to the left side; clicking it again will close the split.

#### Spotlight Feature

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*B60RpU-WptmbOuUaA3kW3Q.png)

Similar to macOS's Spotlight, you can press "Option" + "f" for a full browser search in any window.
- You can use "Option" + "z" or "Control" + "tab" for quick Tab switching.
- "Option" + "1–9" allows quick switching to Tab positions 1-9.

#### Tab Saver (Save Sessions) Feature

Similar to the popular Tab Saver extension on Chrome, this feature allows you to quickly save currently opened Tab pages and switch between them, making it easier to manage different work states.

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*_zGwKwCvGG_xVZE9G0yPLg.jpeg)

Click the "F" (First Session) in the lower left corner to access the Session management page.

Click "Add new session" at the top to save the current Tab state and open a new clean browsing environment.

You can switch between Sessions by clicking "Activate" to restore the Tabs.

> _Sessions will not affect the Applications that are currently activated on the left._

- You can use the shortcut "Option" + "W" for quick Session switching.
- "Option" + "⬆️" + "W" for Session management.

#### Excellent Application Notification Feature

Now, as long as there is a web version of a communication service, you can use the Sidekick Application without needing to install a separate desktop application; as mentioned earlier, the Application's notification feature works just like a desktop application, providing real-time notifications.

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*I_BXx4y_m4isFs3bz_yNkg.png)

- Remember to authorize Sidekick to send desktop notifications; this way, web notifications will pop up on your computer.

#### Note-Taking Feature

Built-in integration with Google Keep allows you to quickly open Google Keep for note-taking by clicking the document icon in the lower left corner.

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*PnXdiHp2mmuC62Iq-I1O2w.jpeg)

Google Keep is stored in the cloud on your Google account, supporting cross-platform and cross-device note synchronization.

You can use this feature to quickly jot down notes.

> **_I'm not sure if they will eventually switch to their own Sidekick Sync, as that would allow for better optimization and integration._**

- You can use the shortcut "Option" + "N" for quick Session switching.

#### Built-in Anti-Tracking, Ad-Blocking, and Memory Management Features

With the rising tide of privacy concerns, major companies are starting to pay attention to user privacy, with Apple leading the way. The latest version of Safari has also begun to include privacy protection features; however, as the biggest beneficiary of user privacy information, I doubt we will see changes in Google Chrome.

> _Chromium \!= Chrome; Chromium is an open-source project that serves as the core technology for browsers._

Although Chromium is also led by Google, its open-source nature allows any developer to optimize based on this core. Sidekick utilizes this method to enhance Chromium, retaining Chrome's features while also strengthening the functionalities that Chrome lacks.

#### Details
- If you are a dual-monitor user, you can also pull Tabs into independent windows; independent windows will not have the left tool bar.
- [Supports all Chrome extensions, which can be directly downloaded and installed from the store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore?hl=zh-TW){:target="_blank"}

> _More features await your exploration and experience!_

### Pricing

> "It is a sin for a business not to make money (if you are not making money, it is a sin against society, because we take society's resources and talent; without sufficient surplus, we are wasting valuable resources that could be used more effectively elsewhere.)" - Panasonic Founder — Konosuke Matsushita (Text reference from the Business Thinking Academy)

A good product needs to have good cash flow to provide better services and sustain itself longer. Here are the pricing details for Sidekick:

![](/assets/118e924a1477/1*QO099z26UL-QMdKmkaKgpg.png)

For personal use, the free plan is more than sufficient, but if you have the means, consider supporting the development team!
- Currently, all users who have joined are on the Early Access plan, which seems unaffected by the Free plan (I have over 5 Sidebar apps and it’s not an issue).
- There’s a plan to invite 10 users for 6 months of Pro access, or invite 20 users for lifetime Pro access; so if you enjoy this article, you can [download and install through this link to support me and Sidekick!](https://join.meetsidekick.com/pokbg){:target="_blank"}

### Summary of Experience

After using it for a while, I’ve completely abandoned Chrome due to the seamless transition; there’s nothing I absolutely need to go back to Chrome for. The best feature is the Applications on the left side, where I can add frequently used work websites for quick switching and to receive the latest notifications.

In the past, I would often get lost in a chaotic sea of tabs, or I could only pin important work services to the front using the Pin Tab feature; but switching between them was still painful as I had to search for them.

Now, when I need to do a Code Review, I just click on GitHub; when I need to submit an app, I click on App Store Connect; and when I want to check a project, I click on Asana. This has made my work much more efficient.

As for memory management, I haven’t done any specific research or testing; I’m not sure about the optimization effects, but having some management is better than none.

> **_The only concern is that this product is still quite new, and I’m not sure how far it can go; if it fails to sustain itself, development and maintenance might stop, which would be a real shame! So please promote and support it vigorously!_**
