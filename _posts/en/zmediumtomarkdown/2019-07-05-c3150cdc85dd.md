### First Experience with Smart Home \- Apple HomeKit & Xiaomi Mi Home

Xiaomi smart camera and smart desk lamp, tutorial on setting up HomeKit


**\[2020/04/20\]** [**Advanced Edition Released**](../99db2a1fbfe5/) **:**
**[Experienced friends can go directly to the left >>](../99db2a1fbfe5/)** [**Demonstration of using Raspberry Pi as HomeBridge host to connect all Xiaomi appliances to HomeKit**](../99db2a1fbfe5/)
### Casual Talk:

I recently moved into a new place; unlike my previous home, which had office-style light fixtures that were so bright I had to remove a few tubes for comfort, my current place has decorative lights that are a bit dim for using the computer and reading. After two weeks, my eyes feel drier and more uncomfortable. I initially thought about going to IKEA for a purchase, but considering the color temperature and eye protection, I ultimately decided to go with the Xiaomi desk lamp (especially since I had already bought a Xiaomi smart camera, both being part of the Mi Home series).
### This Article:

In fact, I didn't pay much attention to whether the products supported Apple HomeKit while shopping, which is quite unprofessional for an iOS developer, as I never expected Xiaomi to support it.

Therefore, this article will introduce **how to use Apple HomeKit**, **how to connect smart home devices that do not support Apple HomeKit with third-party solutions**, and **how to build a smart home using Xiaomi's own ecosystem (with IFTTT)**.

You can jump to the sections based on your device needs.
### Purchases:

I bought two desk lamps, one (Pro) for my computer desk and another for my bedside as a reading lamp.
#### [Xiaomi Desk Lamp Pro](https://www.mi.com/tw/mi-adjustable-smart-desk-lamp/){:target="_blank"} :


![NT$ 1,795 supports Mi Home, Apple HomeKit](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*Aa9zfAh7xclVOZS0IkcaMQ.jpeg)

NT$ 1,795 supports Mi Home, Apple HomeKit
#### [Xiaomi LED Smart Desk Lamp](https://www.mi.com/tw/smartlamp/){:target="_blank"} :


![NT$ 995 supports only Mi Home](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*PCaRI8AroRgFELEA1elaiA.jpeg)

NT$ 995 supports only Mi Home

For detailed information, you can refer to the official website. Both lamps support smart control, color changing, brightness adjustment, and eye protection. The Pro version supports Apple HomeKit and has three adjustable angles. After using them, I am quite satisfied with the functionality of the lamp. If I had to point out a downside, it would be that the Pro version can only rotate the base horizontally, not the lamp itself, which means you can't adjust the angle of the light!
### Ideal Smart Home Goals:
#### Current Devices:
1. Xiaomi Smart Camera PTZ 1080P (supports: Mi Home)
2. Xiaomi Desk Lamp Pro (supports: Apple HomeKit, Mi Home)
3. Xiaomi LED Smart Desk Lamp (supports: Mi Home)

#### Ideal Goals:

**When I return home:** Automatically turn off the camera (for privacy and to prevent accidental activation of the home security alarm, as there is a bug in the Mi Home app that prevents the alarm from turning on and off at the scheduled times), and turn on the Pro lamp at my computer desk (I don't want to fumble in the dark).
**When I leave home:** Automatically turn on the camera (default to activate home security) and turn off all lights.
#### **Final Achievements of This Article:**

Receive push notifications when leaving and returning home, with a tap on the phone to trigger actions (the existing devices cannot achieve the ideal automation goals).
### The Journey of Smart Home Setup:
#### **Using Apple HomeKit**

**\*Only for Xiaomi Desk Lamp Pro! Xiaomi Desk Lamp Pro! Xiaomi Desk Lamp Pro!**

This is the simplest part, as it involves native functionality.


![Only four steps](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*pv62RZ_TjL8X6t-gXnwWtQ.jpeg)

Only four steps
1. Find the Home app (if you don't have it, search for "Home" in the App Store and install it)
2. Open the Home app
3. Click the "+" in the upper right corner to add an accessory
4. Scan the HomeKit QR code on the bottom of the Pro lamp to add the accessory!


![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*0Rm1Ij86bD-fld-N-N1qJw.jpeg)


After successfully adding the accessory, press hard (3D TOUCH) or long press on the accessory to adjust brightness and color.
#### What about smart home devices that **do not support Apple HomeKit**? How to use third-party solutions to connect to HomeKit?

Aside from the smart devices that already support it, can devices that do not support Apple HomeKit be completely controlled through the Home app?
This section will guide you step-by-step on how to add unsupported devices (cameras, standard desk lamps) to the "Home" app!


> **Mac ONLY, Windows users please skip to the section on using Xiaomi's app** 
 

> **My devices are MacOS 10.14/iOS 12** 





**Using [HomeBridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge){:target="_blank"} :**

HomeBridge uses a Mac computer as a bridge to simulate unsupported devices as HomeKit devices, allowing them to be added to the "Home" accessories.


![Operation comparison](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*q2ctcxaaxLFExKXd-9NjPg.png)

Operation comparison

One key point is that **you need to keep a Mac computer running to maintain a smooth bridging channel**; if the computer is shut down or goes to sleep, you won't be able to control those HomeKit devices.

Of course, there are also clever solutions online, such as buying a Raspberry Pi to use as a bridge; however, this involves too much technical detail, which will not be covered in this article.

If you still want to proceed after knowing the downsides, you can continue reading or jump to the next section on using Xiaomi's app.

**Step 1:**

Install [node\.js](https://nodejs.org/en/){:target="_blank"} : [click here](https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.6.0/node-v12.6.0.pkg){:target="_blank"} [to download](https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.6.0/node-v12.6.0.pkg){:target="_blank"}, and install it.

**Step 2:**

Open "Terminal" and enter
```bash
sudo npm -v
```


![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*RBRWT93L_abbhzTItL9Mhg.png)


Check if the node\.js npm package manager is installed successfully: if the version number is displayed, it means success!

**Step 3:**

Install the HomeBridge package via npm:
```bash
sudo npm -g install homebridge --unsafe-perm
```

Wait for the installation to complete... and the HomeBridge tool is now installed!

As mentioned earlier, "HomeBridge uses a Mac computer as a bridge to simulate unsupported devices as HomeKit devices." **In reality, HomeBridge is just a platform; to add devices, you need to find additional HomeBridge plugin resources.**

These are easy to find; just Google or search on GitHub for "mija product English name homebridge," and you'll find many resources. Here are two resources for the devices I am using:

**1\. Xiaomi Camera PTZ Resource: [MijiaCamera](https://github.com/josepramon/homebridge-mijia-camera){:target="_blank"}**

Cameras are trickier devices, and I spent some time researching and organizing this; I hope it helps those in need!

First, use "Terminal" to run the command to install the MijiaCamera npm package
```bash
sudo npm install -g homebridge-mijia-camera
```

After installation, we need to obtain the camera's network **IP address** and **Token** information.


![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*n0TIhqyCoKZo7--ePZwuLA.jpeg)


Open the Mi Home app → Camera → Click the upper right corner "..." → Settings → Network Information to get the **IP address**!

**Token** information is a bit more complicated; you need to connect your phone to your Mac:


![Open iTunes interface](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*0ewSMEH7K2rzUlUtSB61vw.png)

Open iTunes interface

Select backup **do not check encrypt local backup**, click "Back Up Now."

After the backup is complete, [download](http://www.imactools.com/iphonebackupviewer/download/mac){:target="_blank"} and install the backup viewer software: [iBackupViewer](http://www.imactools.com/iphonebackupviewer/download/mac){:target="_blank"}.

When you first open "iBackupViewer," it will ask you to go to Mac "System Preferences" - "Security & Privacy" - "Privacy" - "+" - add "iBackupViewer."
**_\*If you have privacy concerns, you can disable network access for this software and remove it after use._**


![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*kEOxJCkOxDRuFfoxumssgA.png)


Once you reopen "iBackupViewer" and successfully read the backup file, click the upper right corner to switch to "Tree View" mode.


![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*R4l6tRzDaqtiN7xutPKtQg.png)


The left side will display all your installed apps; find the Mi Home app "AppDomain-com\.xiaomi\.mihome" → "Documents."

In the right-side file list, find and select the file **"number_mihome\.sqlite"**.

Click the upper right corner "Export" → "Selected."

Throw the exported sqlite file into [https://inloop\.github\.io/sqlite\-viewer/](https://inloop.github.io/sqlite-viewer/){:target="_blank"} to view its contents.


![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*oRK8tHqom2tnR3CE5xz_-w.png)


You can see all the device information fields from the Mi Home app; scroll to the end to find the **ZTOKEN** field, double-click to edit, select all, and copy.

Finally, open [http://aes\.online\-domain\-tools\.com/](http://aes.online-domain-tools.com/){:target="_blank"} to convert the **ZTOKEN** into the final **Token**.


![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*ZXTe6MEFXjYhqtf9uAJWwQ.png)


1. Paste the copied ZTOKEN into "Input Text," select "Hex."
2. For Key, enter "00000000000000000000000000000000" (32 zeros), also select "Hex."
3. Then click "Decrypt!" to convert.
4. Select all, copy the blue box in the lower right corner, and remove spaces to get the desired **Token**.


> I tried to sniff the Token directly using "miio," but it seems that the firmware of the Xiaomi camera has been updated, and this method no longer works conveniently to obtain the Token! 





**Back to HomeBridge! Edit the config\.json file**


![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*Zh_BWLwMUg5pOxFEVipgiQ.png)


Use "Finder" → "Go" → "Go to Folder" → enter "~/\.homebridge" to navigate there.

Open the "config\.json" file with a text editor; if this file does not exist, please create one or [click here to download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S67NZwXrVqOpps_Cl9l0494foDaHxuWF/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} and place it there.
```json
{
   "bridge":{
      "name":"Homebridge",
      "username":"CC:22:3D:E3:CE:30",
      "port":51826,
      "pin":"123-45-568"
   },
   "accessories":[
      {
         "accessory":"MijiaCamera",
         "name":"Mi Camera",
         "ip":"",
         "token":""
      }
   ]
}
```

Add the above content to config\.json, filling in the IP and Token sections with the information obtained above.

At this point, return to "Terminal" and enter the following command to start HomeBridge:
```bash
sudo homebridge start
```

If you have already started it and changed the config\.json content, you can modify it to:
```bash
sudo homebridge restart
```

Restart


![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*vwCS3QHu285oCrChau9mpw.png)


You will see a HomeKit QR code for you to scan and add the accessory (the steps are as mentioned above for adding Apple HomeKit devices).


![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*CB76x9ryWBve2bssFd0nzA.jpeg)


There will also be status messages:
\[2019–7–4 23:45:03\] \[Mi Camera\] connecting to camera at 192\.168\.0\.100…
\[2019–7–4 23:45:03\] \[Mi Camera\] current power state: off

If these messages appear and there are no error messages, it means the setup was successful!

Common errors usually stem from an incorrect Token; just check if you missed any steps in the process.

Now you can turn the Xiaomi smart camera on and off from the "Home" app!

**2\. Xiaomi LED Smart Desk Lamp HomeBridge Resource: [homebridge\-yeelight\-wifi](https://github.com/vieira/homebridge-yeelight-wifi){:target="_blank"}**

Next is the Xiaomi LED Smart Desk Lamp. Since it does not support Apple HomeKit like the Pro version, we will also use the HomeBridge method to add it. Although the steps **do not require the complicated process of obtaining IP and Token**, it is relatively simpler than the camera, but the desk lamp has its own pitfalls. You need to use another YeeLight app to pair it and enable local network control settings:


![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*uuaLjWduzC5RrOf-gd2-Jw.jpeg)


I have to criticize the poor integration here; the native Mi Home app cannot perform this setting. So please search for the [Yeelight](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/yeelight/id977125608){:target="_blank"} app in the App Store to download and install.

Open the app → log in directly with your Mi Home account → add device → Xiaomi desk lamp → follow the instructions to bind the lamp to the Yeelight app.


![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*GTcap563FDdC0TsH09hZww.jpeg)


Once the device is bound, return to the "Devices" page → click on the Xiaomi desk lamp → click the lower right "△" tab → enter "Local Network Control" settings → enable the button to allow local network control.

**The setup for the desk lamp ends here; you can keep this app to control the lamp or rebind it back to Mi Home.**

**Next is the HomeBridge setup; similarly, open "Terminal" and run the command to install the [homebridge\-yeelight\-wifi](https://github.com/vieira/homebridge-yeelight-wifi){:target="_blank"} npm package**
```bash
sudo npm install -g homebridge-yeelight-wifi
```

After installation, follow the same steps as for the camera, go to the ~/\.homebridge folder, create or edit the config\.json file, and this time just add the following inside the last curly brace:
```json
"platforms": [
   {
         "platform" : "yeelight",
         "name" : "yeelight"
   }
 ]
```

That's it!

**Finally, the combined config\.json file for the above camera looks like this:**
```json
{
 "bridge": {
  "name": "Homebridge",
  "username": "CC:22:3D:E3:CE:30",
  "port": 51826,
  "pin": "123-45-568"
 },

 "accessories": [
  {
   "accessory": "MijiaCamera",
   "name": "Mi Camera",
   "ip": "",
   "token": ""
  }
 ],

 "platforms": [
   {
         "platform" : "yeelight",
         "name" : "yeelight"
   }
 ]
}
```

Then return to "Terminal":
```bash
sudo homebridge start
```

or
```bash
sudo homebridge restart
```

---
You can now see that the previously unsupported MiJia LED Smart Desk Lamp has been added to the HomeKit "Home" app!

![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*3jm0Kd4545DcmzNtPY-dXA.jpeg)

Moreover, it also supports color and brightness adjustments!
#### Now that all HomeKit accessories are added, how do we make them smart?

Once everything is added and bridged, open the "Home" app.

![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*s33BtesqfNSUNyyR069m_Q.jpeg)

Follow the steps to add a scene; here, we'll use "Coming Home" as an example:

Click the "+" in the upper right corner -> Add Scene -> Custom -> Enter the accessory name (e.g., Coming Home) -> Click "Add Accessories" below -> Select the already connected HomeKit accessories -> Set the accessory states for this scene (Camera: Off / Desk Lamp: On) -> You can click "Test Scene" to test it -> Click "Done" in the upper right corner!

Now the scene is set! At this point, clicking the scene on the home page will execute the settings for all accessories within it!

![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*VSArlFmoFERbjH13Cns5TQ.jpeg)

There's also a quick tip: you can directly click the house-shaped button in the pull-down control menu for quick access to HomeKit / executing scenes (you can switch modes in the upper right corner)!
#### Now that we have smart features, how do we automate them?

Now that we have smart features, I want to achieve the ultimate goal: automatically turn off the camera and turn on the lights when I come home; automatically turn on the camera and turn off the lights when I leave.

![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*tCpQ3io2Q2DDCVFxJpBm_g.png)

Switch to the third tab "Automation" to set it up. Unfortunately, I don't have any of the above devices (iPad/Apple TV/HomePod) to serve as a **"[Home Hub](https://support.apple.com/zh-tw/HT207057){:target="_blank"},"** so I haven't researched this part.

The principle seems to be that when you come home, it detects the **"Home Hub,"** and your phone/watch can trigger it accurately!
#### Here, I found a tricky method: (GPS sensing)

Using a third-party app to connect to "Home" and add automation settings allows you to achieve automation by using your phone's GPS location, bypassing the restrictions of the "Automation" tab.

P.S. GPS may have an error of about 100 meters.

![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*Rm101LKv29Avb5wv4isg4A.jpeg)

The third-party app I used for integration is: [myHome Plus](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/myhome-plus-control-for-nest-wemo-and-homekit/id1050479330){:target="_blank"}

After downloading and installing, open the app -> Allow access to "Home Data" -> You will see the configuration of "Home" -> Click the "Settings" button in the upper right corner -> Click "My Home" to enter -> Scroll down to the "Triggers" area -> Click "Add Trigger."

![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*Kk6AMnhSYP4sM8JD_66Iow.jpeg)

Select "Location" for the Trigger type -> Enter a name (e.g., Coming Home) -> Click "Set Location" to set the area -> Then, in REGION STATUS, you can set whether to enter or leave the area -> Finally, in SCENES, you can choose the corresponding "scene" (the one created above).

After clicking "Done" in the upper right corner to save, return to the "Home" app, and you will see that the "Automation" tab is now available!

![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*SXYVBHk9-pMD8YufRQA4zw.png)

At this point, you can select the "+" in the upper right corner to directly add automation scripts using the "Home" app!!

![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*qbtjNCj9mOvjuX7an6rhXw.jpeg)

The steps are similar to the third-party app, but the integration is better! After creating automation using the native "Home" app, you can also swipe to delete the one created with the third-party app.

> **_!! Just be sure to keep at least one; otherwise, the tab will revert to its original locked state!!_**

**Siri voice control:**

Compared to the MiJia introduced below, HomeKit has a high level of integration, allowing you to directly use voice control to set up accessories and execute scenes without any additional setup.

![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*q_ui00ruJl1Fd3_5M-0EhQ.png)

That's all for the HomeKit setup introduction; now let's explain how to use MiJia's native smart home features.
#### **How to build a smart home using MiJia:**

Here, I encountered a confusing point: I couldn't find the same MiJia desk lamp in the list of new devices in MiJia. The answer is:

![Just read the text, this is it](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*xLM5-khndWjvEDdTaFiPfw.png)

Just read the text, this is it.

For other devices like cameras and Pro desk lamps, just follow the official instructions to set them up; I won't elaborate further here.

**Scene setting:**

![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*leO3Z492pJPh3hEASYr-ww.jpeg)

Similar to the "Home" setup method -> Switch to the "Smart" tab -> Select "Manual Execution" -> Choose device operations below (since it's native, more features can be selected) -> Continue to add other devices (desk lamp) -> Click "Save" to complete!

> _Some may wonder why not directly select "Leave or Arrive at a Place"? Because this feature is useless; their app is not optimized for GPS in Taiwan, and it can only be set at landmarks. If your location allows it, you can directly use this feature; **the rest of the article can be skipped!**_

> **_Fun Fact: [The maps of China in Google Maps are all wrong!](https://buzzorange.com/techorange/2019/05/09/china-map-is-wrong/){:target="_blank"}_**

![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*ZjdH5A0QnLq2LNh9lWvCCw.jpeg)

For quick switches, you can set up widgets from "My" -> "Widgets"!

This way, you can quickly execute scenes and devices from the notification center!

![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*DMmicpzKUIr2xtN8JtP3wQ.png)

You can also control the widgets from your [Apple Watch](../a2920e33e73e/)!
_*If the watch app keeps showing blank, please delete and reinstall the watch or phone app; this app has quite a few bugs._
#### Now that we have smart features, how do we automate them?

Here, we will also use GPS sensing; **if the scenes added above are using "Leave or Arrive at a Place," you can skip the following settings!**

\* \* \* \* \*
#### \[2019/09/26\] Update iOS ≥ 13 only uses the built-in Shortcuts app for automation:

[iOS ≥ 13.1 using "Shortcuts" automation feature with MiJia smart home, click to view >>](../21119db777dd/)

\* \* \* \* \*

> _iOS ≥ 12, iOS < 13 Only:_

> **Using the built-in Shortcuts app with IFTTT**

![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*e9ld6Qn7D64CG-DZA1vAsA.jpeg)

First, go to "My" -> "Lab Features" -> "iOS Shortcuts" -> "Add MiJia Scenes to Shortcuts."

Open the system's built-in "[Shortcuts](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/%E6%8D%B7%E5%BE%91/id915249334){:target="_blank"}" app (if you can't find it, search for it in the App Store to download).

![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*-rjtmZ6PHzSzOoBvjJ-FJQ.jpeg)

Click the "+" in the upper right corner to create a shortcut -> Click the "Done" button below to complete the settings -> Name -> Enter a name (preferably in English, as you'll need it later).

![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*5aUsslYvZvlFiSQYJrGgRw.jpeg)

Return to the new shortcut page -> In the lower menu, search for "MiJia" -> Add the corresponding scenes set in MiJia, and turn off "Show When Running," otherwise, the MiJia app will open after execution.

> \*If you can't find MiJia, please return to the MiJia app and try toggling "My" -> "Lab Features" -> "iOS Shortcuts" -> "Add MiJia Scenes to Shortcuts," then close the "Shortcuts" app and reopen it.

At this point, we need to use a third-party app; we will use IFTTT to create GPS entry and exit background triggers. Search for "[IFTTT](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ifttt/id660944635){:target="_blank"}" in the App Store to download and install.

![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*5tXhFP4uT1ySSFAZnnDQGw.jpeg)

Open IFTTT, log in, switch to the "My Applets" tab, click the "+" in the upper right corner to add -> Click "+this" -> Search for "Location" -> Choose whether to enter or leave.

![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*2vs32eIxtEmvqzxOsDLGEw.jpeg)

Set the location -> Click "Create Trigger" to confirm -> Then click "+that" below -> Search for "notification."

![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*bVmWLH5tUcko5eeOmnR3kQ.jpeg)

Select "Send a rich notification from the IFTTT app":

Title = Notification Title, Message = Notification Content

For Link URL, please enter: shortcuts://run-shortcut?name= **_Shortcut Name_**

That's why I said it's better to set the shortcut name in English.

-> Click "Create Action" -> You can click "Edit Title" to set the name.

-> Click "Finish" to save!

**The next time you leave/enter the set area, you will receive a triggered notification (there's still about a 100-meter error range), and clicking the notification will automatically execute the MiJia scene!**

![Clicking the notification will automatically execute the scene in the background](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*a9zXd_JSpz9IKInJlPoJ1w.png)

Clicking the notification will automatically execute the scene in the background.

**Siri voice control:**

Since MiJia is not an Apple built-in app, to support Siri voice control, additional setup is required:

![](/assets/c3150cdc85dd/1*lyzEU2cKxafbnXkWnR7ltg.jpeg)

In the "Smart" tab -> "Add to Siri" -> Select the "Target Scene" and click "Add to Siri."

-> Click the red record command (e.g., Turn Off Lights) -> Done!

You can now directly call Siri to control and execute the scene!
### Summary

To summarize the numerous setup steps above:

For a good experience, you need to spend a lot of money on appliances with the HomeKit logo (so you don't have to keep a Mac running HomeBridge; they integrate perfectly with the native Apple Home features). You also need to buy a HomePod or Apple TV, or an iPad to serve as a home hub; both HomeKit appliances and home hubs are not cheap!

If you have technical skills, consider using third-party smart devices (like MiJia) with a Raspberry Pi to create HomeBridge.

If you're like me, just an ordinary person, using MiJia is the most convenient and user-friendly option. Currently, my usage habit is to execute scene operations from the notification center when coming home or leaving; the Shortcuts app combined with IFTTT serves only as a reminder, in case I forget sometimes.

Currently, the experience hasn't reached the ideal goal, but it's already a step closer to **"Smart Home!"**
