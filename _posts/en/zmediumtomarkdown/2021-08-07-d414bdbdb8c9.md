### Origin

Recently, while optimizing the CI/CD process for an iOS app, I used Fastlane as the automation tool. After packaging and uploading, if I wanted to continue with the automatic submission steps ( `skip_submission=false` ), I had to wait for Apple to complete the process, which could waste about 30-40 minutes of CI server time. This is because the Apple App Store Connect API is not very robust, and Fastlane can only check once a minute whether the uploaded build has been processed, which is a significant waste of resources.

- **Bitrise CI Server:** Limits the number of concurrent builds and has a maximum execution time of 90 minutes. While 90 minutes is sufficient, it can block one build from allowing others to execute.
- **Travis CI Server:** Charges based on build time, making it even less feasible to wait, as costs would escalate.

#### A Change in Approach

No more waiting; finish immediately after uploading! Rely on notifications from processed emails to trigger subsequent actions.

> **_However, I haven't received this email recently; I'm not sure if it's a settings issue or if Apple has stopped sending such notifications._** 





This article will use the notification for TestFlight that is already available for testing as an example.

> _The complete process is illustrated in the above image; the principle is feasible, but this is not the focus of the article. This article will concentrate on receiving emails and using Apps Script to forward them to a Slack Channel._ 




### How to Forward Received Emails to a Slack Channel

Both paid and free Slack projects can use different methods to achieve email forwarding to a Slack Channel or DM.

You can refer to the official documentation for setup: [Send Emails to Slack](https://slack.com/intl/zh-tw/help/articles/206819278-%E5%82%B3%E9%80%81%E9%9B%BB%E5%AD%90%E9%83%B5%E4%BB%B6%E8%87%B3-Slack){:target="_blank"}

**Regardless of the method, the effect is as follows:**


![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*qdoLTotLTaeZPsEHaJ8C7Q.jpeg)

```markdown
> _The default folded email content can be expanded to view all content upon clicking._

**Advantages:**
1. Simple and quick
2. No technical barriers
3. Instant forwarding

**Disadvantages:**
1. Cannot customize content
2. Display style cannot be changed

### Custom Forwarding Content

This is the main point of this article.

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*w4E7wf-Kf8XVFxowmDopIw.png)

Translate the email content data into the desired presentation style, as shown in the example above.
#### First, here’s a complete workflow diagram:

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*yB5s_5rBr4l6hid21huJMQ.jpeg)

- Use Gmail Filter to add an identifying Label to the emails to be forwarded
- Apps Script periodically retrieves emails marked with that Label
- Read the email content
- Render it into the desired display style
- Send messages to Slack via Slack Bot API or directly using Incoming Message
- Remove the email Label (indicating it has been forwarded)
- Done

#### First, create a filter in Gmail

Filters can automate actions when receiving emails that meet certain conditions, such as: automatically marking as read, automatically tagging, automatically moving to spam, automatically categorizing, etc.

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*qNXxtTLzEnlArl4UTTWQMw.jpeg)

In Gmail, click the advanced search icon in the upper right, enter the rules for the emails to be forwarded, such as from: `no_reply@email.apple.com` + subject is `is now available to test.`, click "Search" to check if the filter results are as expected; if correct, click the "Create filter" button next to Search.

![Or directly click Filter message like these at the top of the email to quickly create filter conditions](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*i7grToZwE_ixwJTEjI9qtw.jpeg)

Or directly click Filter message like these at the top of the email to quickly create filter conditions.

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*n_nbqgIlE-E1eaW5QfqkWg.jpeg)

> This button design is very user-unfriendly; I couldn't find it the first time.

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*6zlooS-cMr5LEVX2TW5I_w.jpeg)

The next step is to set the action for emails that meet this filter condition; here we select "Apply the label" to create a new identifying Label "forward-to-slack," and click "Create filter" to complete.

From then on, emails marked with this Label will be forwarded to Slack.
### Obtain Incoming WebHooks App URL

First, we need to add the Incoming WebHooks App to the Slack Channel, which we will use to send messages.

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*AgGLiLsyvenK-LRWI9rlKg.png)

1. Slack bottom left "Apps" -> "Add apps"
2. Search for "incoming" in the search box on the right
3. Click "Incoming WebHooks" -> "Add"

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*DUcwdLTKt33Fa-jNlW8MkA.png)

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*v8Z-5vEM043F82TMiZk2lw.png)

Select the Channel where you want to send the message.

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*SRciom_ygU0JDKK9ATY1FQ.png)

Note the "Webhook URL" at the top.

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*kp1QDIEwzQtmfzUwZIDTSg.png)

Scroll down to set the display name and avatar for the Bot when sending messages; remember to click "Save Settings" after making changes.

> **_Note_**

> _Please note that the official recommendation is to use the new Slack APP Bot API's [chat\.postMessage](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage){:target="_blank"} to send messages. The convenient Incoming Webhook method will be deprecated in the future. This section has not used it for convenience, but it will need to be adjusted to the new method in conjunction with the next chapter "Import Employee List."_

```

### Writing Apps Script Code
- [Click here to go to my Apps Script project](https://script.google.com/home/my){:target="_blank"}
- Click on "New Project" in the upper left corner.
- After creating, you can click on the project name to rename it, e.g., ForwardEmailsToSlack.

Paste the following basic code and modify it to your desired version:
```javascript
function sendMessageToSlack(content) {
    var payload = {
      "text": "*You have received an email*",
      "attachments": [{
          "pretext": "The email content is as follows:",
          "text": content,
        }
      ]
    };
    var res = UrlFetchApp.fetch('Paste your Slack incoming Webhook URL here',{
      method             : 'post',
      contentType        : 'application/json',
      payload            : JSON.stringify(payload)
    })
}

function forwardEmailsToSlack() {
    // Referenced from: https://gist.github.com/andrewmwilson/5cab8367dc63d87d9aa5

    var label = GmailApp.getUserLabelByName('forward-to-slack');
    var messages = [];
    var threads = label.getThreads();
  
    if (threads == null) {
      return;
    }

    for (var i = 0; i < threads.length; i++) {
        messages = messages.concat(threads[i].getMessages())
    }

    for (var i = 0; i < messages.length; i++) {
        var message = messages[i];
        Logger.log(message);

        var output = '*New Email*';
        output += '\n*from:* ' + message.getFrom();
        output += '\n*to:* ' + message.getTo();
        output += '\n*cc:* ' + message.getCc();
        output += '\n*date:* ' + message.getDate();
        output += '\n*subject:* ' + message.getSubject();
        output += '\n*body:* ' + message.getPlainBody();

        sendMessageToSlack(output);
   }

   label.removeFromThreads(threads);
}
```

**Advanced:**
- [You can refer to this official structure document for Slack message styles](https://api.slack.com/messaging/composing/layouts){:target="_blank"}.
- You can use the Regex Match Function in JavaScript to match and scrape the email content.

**EX: Scraping the version number information from the Testflight approval email:**

Email Subject: Your app XXX has been approved for beta testing\.

Email Content:


![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*aZkQGA3N1cquMLt1wyDGFg.jpeg)


We want to obtain the **Bundle Version Short String and the value after Build Number**.
```
var results = subject.match(/(Bundle Version Short String: ){1}(\S+){1}[\S\s]*(Build Number: ){1}(\S+){1}/);
if (results == null || results.length != 5) {
  // not valid
} else {
  var version = results[2];
  var build = results[4];
}
```
- [You can refer to this for Regex usage](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-TW/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions){:target="_blank"}.
- You can use [this website](http://www.rubular.com/){:target="_blank"} to test if your Regex is correct.

#### Try It Out
- Go back to Gmail and find any email, manually add the label — "forward-to-slack"
- In the Apps Script code editor, select "forwardEmailsToSlack" and then click the "Run" button



![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*JHHTQCWNUI-aNPBB6y4iAA.jpeg)



![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*ltXGtEVxkdde1qHGxy3wMw.png)


If "Authorization Required" appears, click "Continue" to complete the authentication


![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*hIgRtqKEFs0tsXDxfNTaOg.png)


During the authentication process, you may see "Google hasn’t verified this app." This is normal because the App Script we wrote has not been verified by Google, but that's okay since it's for personal use.

You can click "Advanced" in the lower left corner -> "Go to ForwardEmailsToSlack (unsafe)"


![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*QUkmTD1WlEzw7cqW97ll6Q.png)


Click "Allow"


![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*TInHsY7Fwb9jHuKJkMJIsw.jpeg)


Forwarding successful!!!
### Set Up a Trigger (Schedule) for Automatic Checking & Forwarding


![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*2Ok6gD5E7F1uqyzgVpoJ8A.jpeg)


In the left menu of Apps Script, select "Triggers."


![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*1xb9xGGkgx6PkhWlWc7HiQ.jpeg)


In the lower left corner, click "+ Add Trigger."


![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*ujCxCH3f8HTvSOP5o4xvmA.jpeg)

- Error notification settings: You can set how to notify you when the script encounters an error during execution.
- Select the function you want to execute: Choose Main Function `sendMessageToSlack`
- Select event source: You can choose from calendar or time-driven (scheduled or specified)
- Select time-based trigger type: You can choose to execute on a specific date or every minute/hour/day/week/month
- Select minute/hour/day/week/month interval: EX: every minute, every 15 minutes…



> _Here, for demonstration purposes, I set it to execute every minute. I think checking emails every hour would be sufficient for real-time updates._ 






![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*LBAlTvz46NJCYgVv1DrfYQ.png)

- Go back to Gmail and find any email, manually add the label — "forward-to-slack"
- Wait for the scheduled trigger


Automatic checking & forwarding successful!
### Completion

With this feature, you can achieve customized email forwarding processing, and even use it as a trigger, for example: automatically executing a certain script when receiving an email from XXX.

Returning to the origin of the first chapter, we can use this mechanism to improve the CI/CD process; no need to wait idly for Apple to complete processing, while also integrating automation!
