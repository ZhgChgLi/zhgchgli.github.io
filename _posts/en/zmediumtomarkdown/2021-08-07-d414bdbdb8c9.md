### Origin

Recently, while optimizing the CI/CD process for an iOS app, I used Fastlane as the automation tool. After packaging and uploading, if I wanted to continue with the automatic submission steps ( `skip_submission=false` ), I had to wait for Apple to complete the process, which wasted about 30-40 minutes of CI server time. This was due to the incomplete Apple App Store Connect API, and Fastlane could only check once a minute if the uploaded build was processed, which wasted a lot of resources.

- **Bitrise CI Server:** Limits the number of concurrent builds and has a maximum execution time of 90 minutes. While 90 minutes is sufficient, one build can block others from executing.
- **Travis CI Server:** Charges based on build time, making it even less feasible to wait, as costs would accumulate.

#### A Change in Perspective

No more waiting; finish the upload and move on! Trigger subsequent actions based on the notification of the completed email.

> **_However, I haven't received this email recently. I'm not sure if it's a settings issue or if Apple has stopped sending such notifications._**

This article will use the notification email for TestFlight, which is already available for testing, as an example.

> _The complete process is illustrated in the above image; the principle is feasible, but this is not the focus of this article. We will concentrate on receiving emails and using Apps Script to forward them to the Slack Channel._

### How to Forward Received Emails to Slack Channel

Both paid and free Slack projects can use different methods to achieve email forwarding to a Slack Channel or DM.

You can refer to the official documentation for setup: [Send Emails to Slack](https://slack.com/intl/zh-tw/help/articles/206819278-%E5%82%B3%E9%80%81%E9%9B%BB%E5%AD%90%E9%83%B5%E4%BB%B6%E8%87%B3-Slack){:target="_blank"}

**Regardless of the method, the effect is as follows:**

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*qdoLTotLTaeZPsEHaJ8C7Q.jpeg)

> _By default, the email content is collapsed, and you can click to expand and view the full content._

**Advantages:**
1. Simple and quick
2. No technical barriers
3. Instant forwarding

**Disadvantages:**
1. Cannot customize content
2. Display style cannot be changed

### Customizing Forwarded Content

This is the main point of this article.

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*w4E7wf-Kf8XVFxowmDopIw.png)

Translate the email content into the style you want to present, as shown in the example above.
#### First, here’s a complete workflow diagram:

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*yB5s_5rBr4l6hid21huJMQ.jpeg)

- Use Gmail Filter to add an identifying label to the emails to be forwarded
- Apps Script periodically retrieves emails marked with that label
- Read the email content
- Render it into the desired display style
- Send messages to Slack via Slack Bot API or directly using Incoming Message
- Remove the email label (indicating it has been forwarded)
- Done

#### First, create a filter in Gmail

Filters can automate actions when receiving emails that meet certain criteria, such as automatically marking as read, tagging, moving to spam, categorizing, etc.

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*qNXxtTLzEnlArl4UTTWQMw.jpeg)

In Gmail, click the advanced search icon in the upper right, enter the criteria for the emails to be forwarded, such as from: `no_reply@email.apple.com` \+ subject is `is now available to test.`, click "Search" to check if the filter results are as expected; if correct, click the "Create filter" button next to Search.

![Or you can quickly create filter criteria by clicking Filter message like these at the top of the email](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*i7grToZwE_ixwJTEjI9qtw.jpeg)

Or you can quickly create filter criteria by clicking Filter message like these at the top of the email.

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*n_nbqgIlE-E1eaW5QfqkWg.jpeg)

> This button is designed in a very user-unfriendly way; I couldn't find it the first time.

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*6zlooS-cMr5LEVX2TW5I_w.jpeg)

Next, set the action for emails that meet this filter condition. Here, we choose "Apply the label" to create a new identifying label "forward\-to\-slack," and click "Create filter" to complete it.

From now on, emails marked with this label will be forwarded to Slack.
### Obtain Incoming WebHooks App URL

First, we need to add the Incoming WebHooks App to the Slack Channel, which we will use to send messages.

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*AgGLiLsyvenK-LRWI9rlKg.png)

1. Click "Apps" in the lower left of Slack -> "Add apps"
2. Search for "incoming" in the search box on the right
3. Click "Incoming WebHooks" -> "Add"

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*DUcwdLTKt33Fa-jNlW8MkA.png)

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*v8Z-5vEM043F82TMiZk2lw.png)

Select the channel where you want to send the message.

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*SRciom_ygU0JDKK9ATY1FQ.png)

Take note of the "Webhook URL" at the top.

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*kp1QDIEwzQtmfzUwZIDTSg.png)

Scroll down to set the display name and avatar for the bot when sending messages; remember to click "Save Settings" after making changes.

> **_Note_**

> _Please note that the official recommendation is to use the new Slack APP Bot API's [chat\.postMessage](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage){:target="_blank"} to send messages. The simpler Incoming Webhook method will be deprecated in the future. I took a shortcut here, but it will need to be adjusted to the new method along with the next chapter "Import Employee List."_

### Writing the Apps Script Code
- [Click here to go to my Apps Script project](https://script.google.com/home/my){:target="_blank"}
- Click "New Project" in the upper left
- After creating it, you can click the project name to rename it, e.g., ForwardEmailsToSlack

Paste the following basic code and modify it to your desired version:
```javascript
function sendMessageToSlack(content) {
    var payload = {
      "text": "*You have received an email*",
      "attachments": [{
          "pretext": "The email content is as follows:",
          "text": content,
        }
      ]
    };
    var res = UrlFetchApp.fetch('Paste your Slack incoming Webhook URL here',{
      method             : 'post',
      contentType        : 'application/json',
      payload            : JSON.stringify(payload)
    })
}

function forwardEmailsToSlack() {
    // Reference from: https://gist.github.com/andrewmwilson/5cab8367dc63d87d9aa5

    var label = GmailApp.getUserLabelByName('forward-to-slack');
    var messages = [];
    var threads = label.getThreads();
  
    if (threads == null) {
      return;
    }

    for (var i = 0; i < threads.length; i++) {
        messages = messages.concat(threads[i].getMessages())
    }

    for (var i = 0; i < messages.length; i++) {
        var message = messages[i];
        Logger.log(message);

        var output = '*New Email*';
        output += '\n*from:* ' + message.getFrom();
        output += '\n*to:* ' + message.getTo();
        output += '\n*cc:* ' + message.getCc();
        output += '\n*date:* ' + message.getDate();
        output += '\n*subject:* ' + message.getSubject();
        output += '\n*body:* ' + message.getPlainBody();

        sendMessageToSlack(output);
   }

   label.removeFromThreads(threads);
}
```

**Advanced:**
- [You can refer to this official structure document for Slack message styles](https://api.slack.com/messaging/composing/layouts){:target="_blank"}.
- You can use JavaScript's Regex Match Function to match and scrape content from the email.

**EX: Scraping the version number information from the TestFlight approval email:**

Email subject: Your app XXX has been approved for beta testing.

Email content:

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*aZkQGA3N1cquMLt1wyDGFg.jpeg)

We want to obtain the **Bundle Version Short String and the value after Build Number**.
```
var results = subject.match(/(Bundle Version Short String: ){1}(\S+){1}[\S\s]*(Build Number: ){1}(\S+){1}/);
if (results == null || results.length != 5) {
  // not valid
} else {
  var version = results[2];
  var build = results[4];
}
```
- [You can refer to this guide for using Regex](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-TW/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions){:target="_blank"}
- You can use [this website](http://www.rubular.com/){:target="_blank"} to test if your Regex is correct.

#### Let's Run It
- Go back to Gmail, find any email, and manually add the label — "forward\-to\-slack"
- In the Apps Script code editor, select "forwardEmailsToSlack" and then click the "Run" button.

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*JHHTQCWNUI-aNPBB6y4iAA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*ltXGtEVxkdde1qHGxy3wMw.png)

If "Authorization Required" appears, click "Continue" to complete the verification.

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*hIgRtqKEFs0tsXDxfNTaOg.png)

During the authentication process, you may see "Google hasn’t verified this app." This is normal since our Apps Script hasn't been verified by Google, but that's okay since it's for personal use.

You can click "Advanced" in the lower left -> "Go to ForwardEmailsToSlack (unsafe)."

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*QUkmTD1WlEzw7cqW97ll6Q.png)

Click "Allow."

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*TInHsY7Fwb9jHuKJkMJIsw.jpeg)

Forwarding successful!!!
### Set Up a Trigger (Schedule) for Automatic Checking & Forwarding

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*2Ok6gD5E7F1uqyzgVpoJ8A.jpeg)

In the left menu of Apps Script, select "Triggers."

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*1xb9xGGkgx6PkhWlWc7HiQ.jpeg)

Click "+ Add Trigger" in the lower left.

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*ujCxCH3f8HTvSOP5o4xvmA.jpeg)

- Error notification settings: You can set how to notify you when the script encounters an error.
- Choose the function you want to execute: Select the main function `sendMessageToSlack`.
- Select event source: You can choose from calendar or time-driven (scheduled or specific).
- Select time-based trigger type: You can choose to execute on a specific date or every minute/hour/day/week/month.
- Select the interval for minutes/hours/days/weeks/months: EX: every minute, every 15 minutes…

> _Here, to demonstrate, I set it to execute every minute. I think checking emails every hour would be sufficient for real-time needs._

![](/assets/d414bdbdb8c9/1*LBAlTvz46NJCYgVv1DrfYQ.png)

- Go back to Gmail, find any email, and manually add the label — "forward\-to\-slack."
- Wait for the scheduled trigger.

Automatic checking & forwarding successful!
### Completion

With this feature, you can achieve customized email forwarding processing, and even use it as a trigger for other actions, such as automatically executing a script when receiving an email from XXX.

Returning to the origin discussed in the first chapter, we can use this mechanism to enhance the CI/CD process; there's no need to wait idly for Apple to complete processing, and we can integrate it into an automated workflow!
