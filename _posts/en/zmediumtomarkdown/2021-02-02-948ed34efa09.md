### Features

One of the most common issues encountered in services that have both a website and an app is that users have registered and saved their passwords on the website; however, after being prompted to install the app, it is very inconvenient to have to re-enter their account and password from scratch when opening the login. This feature allows the account and password already stored on the phone to be automatically filled into the app associated with the website, speeding up the user login process.

No fuss, here’s the completed effect diagram; at first glance, you might think it’s the iOS ≥ 11 Password AutoFill feature; however, please take a closer look—the keyboard does not pop up, and I clicked the "Select Saved Password" button to bring up the account and password selection window.

Since we mentioned Password AutoFill, let me tease you a bit and first introduce Password AutoFill and how to set it up!
### Password AutoFill


![](/assets/948ed34efa09/1*BZQcOoRV5IcRuI2HsSmKRQ.gif)


Support: iOS ≥ 11

Now that we are at iOS 14, this feature has become very common and is nothing special; on the account and password login page in the app, when the keyboard is called up for input, you can quickly select the account and password from the website version of the service, and after selection, it can be automatically filled in for quick login!
#### So how do the app and web recognize each other?

Associated Domains! We specify Associated Domains in the app and upload the apple-app-site-association file on the website, allowing both sides to recognize each other.

**1\. In the project settings under "Signing & Capabilities" -> Top left "+ Capabilities" -> "Associated Domains"**


![](/assets/948ed34efa09/1*0oVHvGSzUA5cohhsSyuamA.png)


Add `webcredentials:your website domain` (ex: `webcredentials:google.com`).

**2\. Go to the [Apple Developer Backend](https://developer.apple.com/account/){:target="_blank"}**

Record the "Team ID" in the "Membership" tab


![](/assets/948ed34efa09/1*LLlPP2VVCinVdrMsXWvj3g.png)


**3\. Go to "Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles" -> "Identifiers" -> Find your project -> Open the "Associated Domains" feature**


![](/assets/948ed34efa09/1*ssGVeTV7AAfkbf1iYeQX7Q.png)


**APP side settings completed!**

```markdown
**4\. Web Site Configuration**

Create a file named **apple-app-site-association** (without an extension), edit it using a text editor, and enter the following content:
```json
{
  "webcredentials": {
    "apps": [
      "TeamID.BundleId"
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace `TeamID.BundleId` with your project settings (e.g., TeamID = `ABCD`, BundleID = `li.zhgchg.demoapp` => `ABCD.li.zhgchg.demoapp`).

Upload this file to the website's `root directory` or the `/.well-known` directory. If your `webcredentials domain` is set to `google.com`, then this file should be accessible at `google.com/apple-app-site-association` or `google.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`.

**Note: Subdomains**

![](/assets/948ed34efa09/1*ObLXi_XGDDR4A3Mo1WdIEA.png)

According to the official documentation, if there are subdomains, they must all be listed in the Associated Domains.

**Web Configuration Complete!**

**Note: applinks**

It has been found that if you have set up a universal link `applinks`, you actually do not need to add the `webcredentials` part for it to work; however, let's stick to the documentation to avoid any future issues.
#### Back to the Code

In the code section, we only need to set the TextField as follows:
```swift
usernameTextField.textContentType = .username
passwordTextField.textContentType = .password
```

If it's a new registration, the password confirmation field can use:
```swift
repeatPasswordTextField.textContentType = .newPassword
```

After rebuilding and running the app, when entering the username, the keyboard will display options for saved passwords from the same website.
#### Done!

![](/assets/948ed34efa09/1*VKsfZLnzoNno-IgPRp-odg.jpeg)

#### Not Appearing?

It may be because the autofill password feature is not enabled (the simulator is off by default). Please go to "Settings" -> "Passwords" -> "Autofill Passwords" -> enable "Autofill Passwords".

![](/assets/948ed34efa09/1*a0vCvZA6PajjOwc8DFymIg.jpeg)

Alternatively, the website may not have any existing passwords. You can also add one by going to "Settings" -> "Passwords" -> tap the "+" in the upper right corner -> add a new one.

### Getting to the Point

After introducing the Password AutoFill, let's move on to the main topic; how to achieve the effect shown in the image.
#### [Shared Web Credentials](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/shared_web_credentials){:target="_blank"}

Starting from iOS 8.0, this feature was rarely seen in apps. Even before the Password AutoFill was released, this API could be used to integrate website account passwords for quick selection by users.

Shared Web Credentials can not only read account passwords but also add, modify, and delete existing account passwords.
#### Configuration

> **_⚠️ The configuration must also set up Associated Domains, just like the Password AutoFill settings._**

> So it can be said that this is an enhanced version of the Password AutoFill feature!!

Because the environment required for Password AutoFill must be set up first to use this "advanced" feature.
#### Reading

Use the `SecRequestSharedWebCredential` method to perform the operation:
```swift
SecRequestSharedWebCredential(nil, nil) { (credentials, error) in
  guard error == nil else {
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
      //alert error
    }
    return
  }
  
  guard CFArrayGetCount(credentials) > 0,
    let dict = unsafeBitCast(CFArrayGetValueAtIndex(credentials, 0), to: CFDictionary.self) as? Dictionary<String, String>,
    let account = dict[kSecAttrAccount as String],
    let password = dict[kSecSharedPassword as String] else {
      DispatchQueue.main.async {
        //alert error
      }
      return
    }
    
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
      //fill account,password to textfield
    }
}
```

```swift
SecRequestSharedWebCredential(fqdn, account, completionHandler)
// **fqdn** If there are multiple `webcredentials` domains, you can specify one, or use null to not specify
// **account** Specify a particular account to query, use null to not specify

> `"Use ASAuthorizationController to make an ASAuthorizationPasswordRequest (AuthenticationServices framework)"` 

This method is only applicable to iOS 8 ~ iOS 14. After iOS 13, you can use the same **Sign in with Apple** API — **AuthenticationServices**
#### **AuthenticationServices Reading Method**

Supported iOS ≥ 13
```swift
import AuthenticationServices

class ViewController: UIViewController {
  override func viewDidLoad() {
      super.viewDidLoad()
      //...
      let request: ASAuthorizationPasswordRequest = ASAuthorizationPasswordProvider().createRequest()
      let controller = ASAuthorizationController(authorizationRequests: [request])
      controller.delegate = self
      controller.performRequests()
      //...
  }
}

extension ViewController: ASAuthorizationControllerDelegate {
    func authorizationController(controller: ASAuthorizationController, didCompleteWithAuthorization authorization: ASAuthorization) {
        
        if let credential = authorization.credential as? ASPasswordCredential {
          // fill credential.user, credential.password to textfield
        }
        // else if as? ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential... sign in with apple
    }
    func authorizationController(controller: ASAuthorizationController, didCompleteWithError error: Error) {
        // alert error
    }
}
```

Effect image, you can see that the new approach integrates better with the process and display of Sign in with Apple.

> **_⚠️ This login cannot replace_** _Sign in with Apple (the two are different things)._ 

#### Writing Account Password to "Passwords"

Only the reading part has been Deprecated; the parts for adding, deleting, and editing can still be used as before.

For adding, deleting, and editing, use `SecAddSharedWebCredential` to perform operations.
```swift
SecAddSharedWebCredential(domain as CFString, account as CFString, password as CFString?) { (error) in
  DispatchQueue.main.async {
    guard error == nil else {
      // alert error
      return
    }
    // alert success
  }
}
```

```swift
SecAddSharedWebCredential(fqdn, account, password, completionHandler)
- **fqdn** can be any domain you want to store, not necessarily one in `webcredentials`
- **account** specifies the account to be added, modified, or deleted
- To delete data, pass **password** as **`nil`**
- Logic handling:
\- account exists & password provided = modify password
\- account exists & password passed as nil = delete account, password from domain
\- account does not exist & password provided = add account, password to domain



![](/assets/948ed34efa09/1*dGN5rv4jZ-wlY9HYoymNCQ.png)



> **_⚠️_** _Additionally, this does not allow you to modify in the background; each modification will prompt a dialog box to notify the user, and the user must click "Update Password" for the data to be actually modified._ 




#### Password Generator

The last small feature is the password generator.

Use `SecCreateSharedWebCredentialPassword()` to operate.
```swift
let password = SecCreateSharedWebCredentialPassword() as String? ?? ""
```


![](/assets/948ed34efa09/1*Xd-CiH62N354u6JPQ4b8cQ.png)


The password generated by the generator consists of uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers, using "-" as a separator (e.g., Jpn-4t2-gaF-dYk).

### Minor Drawback

Friends using third-party password management tools (e.g., 1Password, LastPass) may notice that while keyboard Password AutoFill supports display & input, it does not show up in AuthenticationServices or SecRequestSharedWebCredential; it's uncertain if this requirement can be met.

### Conclusion

Thank you all for reading, and thanks to [saiday](https://twitter.com/saiday){:target="_blank"} and Street Voice for letting me know about this feature XD.

Also, the new recording feature in XCode ≥ 12.5 simulator, which supports saving as GIF, is incredibly useful!


![](/assets/948ed34efa09/1*LUaFOoZHai41oFNFkh6b4A.jpeg)


Press "Command" + "R" in the simulator to start recording, click the red dot to stop recording; right-click on the preview image that slides out in the lower right corner and select "Save as Animated GIF" to save it as a GIF and then directly paste it into the article!
