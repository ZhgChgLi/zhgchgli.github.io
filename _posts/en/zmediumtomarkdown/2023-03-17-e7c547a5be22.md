This tool can help you transfer your Medium posts to a Jekyll blog and keep them synchronized in the future.

It will automatically download your posts from Medium, convert them to Markdown, and upload them to your repository. Check out [my blog](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/zhgchgli.github.io/){:target="_blank"} for an online demo [zhgchg.li](https://zhgchg.li/){:target="_blank"}.

**One-time setting, Lifetime enjoying❤️**

If you only want to create a backup or auto-sync of your Medium posts, you can use the GitHub Action directly by following the instructions in this [Wiki](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown/wiki/How-to-use-Github-Action-as-your-free-&-no-code-Medium-Posts-backup-service){:target="_blank"} .

### Setup

- You can follow each step of this process by watching the following [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsnZKFL3vks){:target="_blank"}

1. Click the green button `Use this template` above and select `Create a new repository`.

2. Repo Owner can be an organization or username.

3. Enter the Repository Name, usually your GitHub Username/Organization Name followed by `.github.io`. For example, if my organization name is `zhgchgli`, it will be `zhgchgli.github.io`.

4. Choose the `public` repository option, then click `Create repository from template`.

5. Allow access to GitHub Actions by going to the `Settings` tab in your GitHub repository, selecting `Actions` -> `General`, locating the `Workflow permissions` section, selecting `Read and write permissions`, and clicking `Save` to apply the changes.

*If you choose a different Repository Name, the GitHub page will be `https://username.github.io/Repository Name` instead of `https://username.github.io/`, and you will need to fill in the `baseurl` field in `_config.yml` with your Repository Name.

*If you are using an organization and cannot enable `Read and Write permissions` in the repository settings, please refer to the organization settings page and enable it there.

### First-time run

1. Please refer to the configuration information in the section below and make sure to specify your Medium username in the `_zmediumtomarkdown.yml` file.

2. ⌛️ Please wait for the `Automatic Build` and `pages-build-deployment` GitHub actions to finish before making any further changes.

3. Then, you can manually run the ZMediumToMarkdown GitHub action by going to the `Actions` tab in your GitHub repository, selecting the `ZMediumToMarkdown` action, clicking on the `Run workflow` button, and selecting the `main` branch.

4. ⌛️ Please wait for the action to download and convert all Medium posts from the specified username, and commit the posts to your repository.

5. ⌛️ Please wait for the `Automatic Build` and `pages-build-deployment` actions to finish before making any further changes. They will start automatically once the ZMediumToMarkdown action has completed.

6. Go to the `Settings` section of your GitHub repository and select `Pages`. In the `Branch` field, select `gh-pages`, and leave `/(root)` selected as the default. Click `Save`. You can also find the URL for your GitHub page at the top of the page.

7. ⌛️ Please wait for the `Pages build and deployment` action to finish.

8. 🎉 After completing all actions, you can visit your xxx.github.io page to verify the results. Congratulations! 🎉

*To avoid expected Git conflicts or unexpected errors, please follow the steps carefully and in order, and be patient while waiting for each action to complete.

*Note that the first run may take longer.

*If you open the URL and notice that something is wrong, such as missing web styles, please make sure your configuration in the `_config.yml` file is correct.

*Please refer to the ‘Things to Know’ and ‘Troubleshooting’ sections below for more information.

### Troubleshooting

#### My GitHub page keeps presenting a 404 error or doesn’t update with the latest posts.

- Please make sure you have followed the setup steps above in order.

- Wait for all GitHub actions to finish, including the `Pages build and deployment` and `Automatic Build` actions. You can check the progress on the `Actions` tab.

- Make sure you have the correct settings selected in `Settings -> Pages`.

### Things to know

- The `ZMediumToMarkdown` GitHub Action for syncing Medium posts runs automatically every day by default. You can also manually trigger it on the GitHub Actions page or change the sync frequency as needed.

- Every commit and post change will trigger the `Automatic Build` & `Pages build and deployment` action. Please wait for this action to finish before checking the final result.

- You can create your own Markdown posts in the `_posts` directory by naming the file as `YYYY-MM-DD-POSTNAME` and it is recommended to use lowercase file names.

- You can include images and other resources in the `/assets` directory.

- Also, if you would like to remove the ZMediumToMarkdown watermark located at the bottom of the post, you may do so. I don’t mind.

- You can edit the Ruby file at `tools/optimize_markdown.rb` and uncomment lines `10–12`. This will automatically remove the ZMediumToMarkdown watermark at the end of all posts during Jekyll build time.

- Since ZMediumToMarkdown is not an official tool and Medium does not provide a public API for it, I cannot guarantee that the parser target will remain unchanged in the future. However, I have tested it with as many cases as possible. If you encounter any rendering errors or Jekyll build errors, please feel free to create an issue, and I will fix them as soon as possible.
