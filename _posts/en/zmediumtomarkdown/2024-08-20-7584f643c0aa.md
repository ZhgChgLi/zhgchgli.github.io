#### Problem

Since XCode \(possibly starting from version 14?\), some projects experience a black screen issue after multiple builds and runs on the simulator, getting stuck at "Launching Application..." with no response; rebuilding and running does not help, and you need to manually terminate the entire simulator and restart it to fix the issue.

New projects with fewer settings encounter this issue less frequently; older projects face it more often. However, due to their long history and complex settings, it is difficult to find a definitive root cause online, with most speculating it is an XCode bug \(or M1?\); nonetheless, this problem is quite frustrating, as you often need to build and run to see results, only to be met with darkness, requiring a complete restart each time, wasting about 1–2 minutes, which significantly interrupts development.
### Workaround

Here is a workaround that turns the situation around. The idea is that since we cannot avoid the black screen issue, and the black screen does not appear during the first build and run of the simulator, we just need to ensure that each build and run is done on a freshly restarted simulator.
#### First, we need to obtain the `Device UUID` of the simulator you want to run

Execute in Terminal:
```bash
xcrun simctl list devices
```

- Find the simulator device you want to use and its Device UUID.
- Here, I will use my iPhone 15 Pro (iOS 17.5) as an example.
Device UUID = `08C43D34–9BF0–42CF-B1B9–1E92838413CC`

#### Next, let's create a `auto-reboot.sh` Shell Script file.
- `cd /the_directory_where_you_want_to_place_this_script/`
- `vi auto-reboot.sh`

**Paste the following script:**
- Replace `[Device UUID]` with the Device UUID of the simulator you want to use.
- **Remember to update the Device UUID in this script if the simulator changes; otherwise, it will be ineffective.**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

## Use the command below to find the Device UUID of the simulator you want to use:
## xcrun simctl list devices

# shutdown simulator
xcrun simctl shutdown [Device UUID]

# reboot simulator
xcrun simctl boot [Device UUID]
```
- The script logic is straightforward: it shuts down and restarts the simulator you want to use.
- `ESC` & `:wq!`

**Adjust the execution permissions of `auto-reboot.sh`:**
```bash
chmod +x auto-reboot.sh
```

### Return to XCode Settings

Since everyone has different preferences for simulators, I set this up in XCode Behaviors, which won't affect the project's settings or impact other team members on git. However, for a simpler, team-wide synchronization, you can directly set it in Scheme -> Build -> Pre-actions -> `sh /the_directory_where_you_want_to_place_this_script/auto-reboot.sh`.
#### XCode Behaviors

![](/assets/7584f643c0aa/1*2s2UOZMBkTn8GhdiO4KYwg.png)

- XCode -> Behaviors -> Edit Behaviors…

![](/assets/7584f643c0aa/1*eALkD0S11rEiNEvwyCCJzg.png)

- Find the `Running` section.
- Select the `Completes` option.
**Completes Timing** = Stop or Rebuild.
- Check `Run` on the right side.

- Choose `Choose Script…` and select the location of the newly created `auto-reboot.sh` file.
- Done.

#### Principle and Conclusion

![Demo is a clean project, so the build time is very short](/assets/7584f643c0aa/1*A-enPIU3D-MEwz1-aF-ByQ.gif)

The demo is a clean project, so the build time is very short.

We utilize XCode Behaviors to restart the simulator at the Completes (Stop or Rebuild) timing point, which occurs before the build starts, allowing it to almost complete the restart before Build -> Run ends.

If you repeatedly press restart, there is a chance it may restart too slowly, causing Run to not find the target and resulting in another type of black screen. However, this situation is not considered; at least this solution can maintain normal execution of Build & Run App during regular use.

I think the impact on speed is acceptable since Build & Run itself takes some time, and there is usually enough time for the simulator to restart.
