### Leading Snowflakes — Reading Notes

“Leading Snowflakes The Engineering Manager Handbook” — Oren Ellenbogen



![](/assets/1c9eafd4a190/1*yJCwDuo9tMhDD_sSoCSNqA.png)


As a new manager, everything feels confusing; the knowledge I have about management comes only from consolidating previous work experiences, observations, or casual chats with colleagues. I know what actions taken by supervisors have positive or negative effects on their subordinates; these experiences are fragmented, lacking a systematic understanding. Thus, I began reading books and recording the experiences of each author. When encountering similar situations, having this "knowledge foundation" helps me avoid feeling flustered.

The author has transitioned from a software engineer to a management role over nearly 20 years of work experience, serving as a Technical Lead and Engineering Manager in both large corporations and startups. This book details the bottlenecks encountered when moving from engineering to management and the methods to organize and solve them.

I find this very similar to my background, as I also started in software development and am now exploring management. The key points mentioned in the book have taught me many actionable methods!


> _\- This article is merely personal notes mixed with some personal viewpoints. In this age of fragmented information, I strongly recommend reading the original book to systematically absorb its essence._ 
 

> _\- The purpose of notes is to make it easier to quickly locate points for review later._ 
 

> _\- Some content is directly excerpted from the original text._ 




### Lesson 1\. — Switch between “Manager” and “Maker” modes

The transition from Engineer (Maker) to Manager.

Completing tasks or elegantly solving problems is a measure of an excellent engineer, but as a manager, this is not how one is evaluated. We have already proven this; instead, the criteria are based on leading, driving, and enhancing the capabilities of the team.

However, one cannot completely detach oneself from tasks; fully abstracting from task details can lead to disconnection from team members, which poses significant long-term risks regarding execution outcomes, priorities, and trust.

Thus, being a manager does not mean one should stop doing engineering tasks; rather, one must balance between being an Engineer (Maker) and a Manager.

As engineers, we prefer uninterrupted time to stay in context while solving difficult problems; however, as managers, we need to frequently step out to assist the team and care for teammates, so interruptions are actually part of a manager's job.
#### But how can we manage both roles as Engineer and Manager?

The author suggests establishing two calendars, one for as Maker (Engineer) and one for as Manager. Then, each morning, take 15-30 minutes to organize thoughts and schedule the day's agenda, determining what tasks to do, what meetings to attend, and identifying continuous time slots available for solving tasks (as Maker).

Author's Calendar Template
#### We also need focused time

The author states that now as a manager, we still need to handle tasks simultaneously; the available focused time is more important to us than before.

The author mentions that during focused time, we can communicate to teammates through certain actions that we should not be disturbed!

Methods include going to a meeting room, wearing headphones, or even buying an ON AIR! sign to place on the desk.

If it is not an urgent issue, teammates can be asked to leave messages or compile information to email to you, which can be addressed after the focused time ends.
#### Assessing tasks that can be solved during time as an Engineer


Since it is no longer possible to fully immerse oneself in development requirements like when I was purely an engineer (Maker), I need to choose tasks that I can personally execute based on the time available in the engineer's calendar.

Do not become a technical bottleneck for the team. Our mission is to enhance the team's capabilities, explore new technologies, and broaden the company's technical vision both externally and internally. Possible actions include conducting preliminary research on technical issues, sharing findings with teammates for them to execute, addressing technical debt, improving processes to increase development efficiency, utilizing new technologies, open-sourcing company technology, providing open APIs, and participating in external hackathons, among others.
#### The Most Important Thing is Balance

The author suggests starting with a distribution of 15–20%. Originally, it was 100% as a Maker; now it might be 20% as a Maker / 80% as a Manager (though this depends on the actual team size and member capabilities; the author also mentions that 50% / 50% is possible). It is essential not to be 100% focused on engineering development but to invest more effort in management.
#### Make Good Use of 1:1

Regularly hold 1:1 meetings with teammates to provide mutual feedback and share what you have learned.
#### If Management Tasks Consume All Your Time

The author finally mentions that if your management tasks are so overwhelming that you cannot engage in engineering (as a Maker), and you feel disconnected from tasks and technology, consider choosing a few days each week to work from home to isolate yourself from the company or participate in hackathons.
### Lesson 2. — Code Review Your Management Decisions

Regularly review the decisions you make as a manager.

As engineers, we have many methods or tools that can enhance our abilities simply by following them, such as pair programming, code reviews, and design patterns. However, as managers, especially when new, we often feel quite lonely.

We may not want to admit our ignorance to our superiors or subordinates, fearing the responsibility for the team's success and worrying about not balancing technical debt with business needs properly.

The author emphasizes the importance of stepping out to seek ways to improve management skills, openly soliciting feedback, and enhancing management capabilities; being a manager can be as passionate as being an engineer.
#### Document and Review Decisions

Colleagues and bosses are powerful resources that we often underestimate. We can quickly learn from their feedback. Establishing a habit of documenting and reviewing decisions can help us receive better feedback.

The author mentions:

> “There is no one right way, there are only tradeoffs.”

I believe this is true; if it weren't a dilemma, you probably wouldn't be asking. If you are asking, it means your teammates are unsure how to decide.

We can list options and provide decisions to teammates, but at the same time, we should also document the decisions made.


![Template of the Record Sheet provided by the author](/assets/1c9eafd4a190/1*ckCF-uBpxAjNzbUTdvMhBA.png)

Template of the Record Sheet provided by the author

Develop the habit of documenting and ensure that the content can be recalled later.

The author suggests reviewing monthly, sharing and discussing decisions with your boss, other managers, or colleagues (at least half of the issues should be shared), and listening to others' perspectives. Anonymity can protect the individuals involved, focusing on the issue rather than the person, and documenting it.
#### Key Points for Review

**Regarding Issues:**
- How many technical problems were raised?
- Is it a personal issue?
- Is it just an independent issue of a specific member? (Is it simply that they do not understand the goal?)
- Will this problem recur in other teams?

**Regarding Decisions:**
- Does this issue really require a manager's decision?
- Have you asked for teammates' suggestions?
- Are there other more experienced individuals who can provide advice?
- Upon rethinking, would it still be the same decision?

### Lesson 3. — Confront and Challenge Your Teammates

Encourage teammates to step out of their comfort zones and avoid becoming a jerk or falling into traps.

The author mentions that it was initially uncomfortable because colleagues who were once friends became subordinates; he feared damaging the existing relationship. Thus, he took on all the finishing tasks, but ultimately he found that the more he protected, the further he distanced himself from his teammates, as his relentless hard work led to a lack of sharing, causing teammates to lose faith.

Looking back, the author states that rather than fearing the hurt feelings of teammates, it is better to express what you truly think. The fear of hurting teammates is merely a selfish imagination and unnecessary; moreover, it is the responsibility of a manager to lead the team to grow and move forward, keeping an eye on the bigger picture and managing risks.

Sharing genuine thoughts is challenging for both parties, but it is a manager's responsibility.


[![Empathy vs Sympathy](/assets/1c9eafd4a190/b618_hqdefault.jpg "Empathy vs Sympathy")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kgKanOYSsU){:target="_blank"}


We need to show empathy rather than sympathy; to help them excel in their work, they need our objective opinions.

**The author provides the following three key points to help us balance emotions and actions:**
1. Am I showing empathy?
2. Have I clearly communicated my expectations?
3. Am I leading by example?



> “If you want to achieve anything in this world, you have to get used to the idea that not everyone will like you.”

> If you want to achieve something, you must get used to the fact that not everyone will like your ideas.

**Four Common Traps:**
1. Compared to hiding, do I openly share my failures? (This could be writing articles or sending emails to everyone.)
2. Forgetting to consolidate discussion results (Get into the habit of recording 1:1s and the outcomes of discussions.)
3. Using the wrong feedback medium and not getting to the real issues (Find suitable feedback channels according to team culture, e.g., 1:1s.)
4. Delayed feedback.  
We need to be aware that engineers like to challenge themselves and improve their skills while also wanting respect and feedback from their supervisors. Our task is to lead the team to grow, so we should not delay feedback opportunities because failing to make a decision is equivalent to making a decision. Moreover, once the culture of feedback weakens, it becomes even harder to reignite it.

**Summary**

Take time to write down ways to motivate teammates and ask supervisors if they are being too protective of them.  
### Lesson 4. — Teach how to get things done

How to complete tasks with lower risk.

Leading by example is a good method; occasionally participate in team development to demonstrate how to plan and produce good features that convey our intended message. Additionally, pay attention to saying more about Why? (Why do it this way?) and less about How? (How to do it.)

The author mentions a culture of extreme transparency, which allows team members to have complete context and enhances their ability to drive decisions.

**Reduce Risks**
1. To lower the risk of output, the author suggests breaking down requirements into many small iterative features and sharing this idea with other teams.
2. Scale and performance — always have a backup plan.  
Will this feature affect performance (or cause other issues)? Can we know in advance? Is there a backup plan (a switch)? It’s better not to implement it without a backup, as it can affect team confidence.
3. Break tasks down into smaller tasks to reduce deadline risks.  
It may be difficult at first, but it can be trained and learned.
4. Make good use of peer pressure.  
Distribute tasks among teammates for collaboration, and work together (Code Review is also included).
5. Continuously communicate internally and externally.  
Internally: Ensure expectations, synchronization, deadlines, and resources; externally: communicate, and if time is tight, cancel unimportant meetings.
6. Support, fix bugs, and document.  
It’s not enough to just release features; we also need to provide customer support, fix bugs, and maintain documentation.
7. Conduct reviews and delegate tasks, providing others with leadership opportunities.
8. Select a few tasks that can serve as examples.
9. Ask teammates what they have learned, what motivates them to be more proactive, and what they dislike.

### Lesson 5. — Delegate tasks without losing quality or visibility

Delegating tasks without losing quality and visibility.

As a manager, it is essential to delegate tasks effectively. The author believes that delegation should set clear expectations and trust that the assigned teammates have the capability to execute and have the opportunity to learn while allowing room for mistakes. On the other hand, managers should protect teammates from company pressures.

The author uses the following table for recording:

![](/assets/1c9eafd4a190/1*7trny5YJAnmgr6AMxqsduw.png)

This mainly records tasks that are important to team goals; daily work does not need to be recorded.
- Must write down the task details.

When considering whether to delegate a task to a teammate, the author first asks if this task is something only I can do and if it is something that should be done by a manager. The second question is whether this task is a long-term leadership task; if neither is true, then delegate it to a teammate.

For tasks to be delegated, evaluate the teammate's experience and skills to find the right candidate.
- External regarding external or upper expectations for resources (Feedback/Tool).
- Delegate.

For the delegation part, we can provide a one-page paper outlining our expectations and a simple example.  
### Lesson 6. — Build trust with other teams in the organization

Collaboration and synergy between teams.

The author explains that organizations split into many small groups for quick decision-making to accomplish more. Defining the direction for each small group is not difficult (e.g., iOS is for developing iOS apps); the challenge lies in aligning the goals of all groups.

The more groups there are, the harder it is to unify everyone's values, expectations, priorities, and implicit expectations.

We should focus on the reasons and motivations for splitting groups rather than just the outputs, as this could lead to contradictions.

**The author believes that the following methods can align the direction of various groups:**
1. Teams should have a vision, not just handle tasks.
2. Managers need to distinguish between needs and wants.
3. Optimize the team to complete the right things faster rather than just completing more tasks.
4. Establish good communication with other team managers.  
The author suggests sharing the status of the team, discussing obstacles and pain points, and outlining upcoming major tasks and their reasons in bi-weekly manager meetings.
5. When there are differing opinions on priorities with other teams, explain other factors (e.g., completing this will reduce customer complaints, provide a one-time solution, or create a synergistic effect…).
6. First, understand where external teams need our help and proactively follow up closely.
7. Then, present the points where our team needs help from external teams.
8. Prepare a checklist of items to confirm, ensuring they are discussed in meetings; if not, follow up with relevant managers afterward to see if there are other possibilities.
9. If not possible, weigh the potential delays or alternative solutions and inform stakeholders (to prevent backdoor criticism).
10. Everything is a trade-off.

**Additionally, here are 5 methods to help teammates build close relationships with other teams:**
- Simple thank-you notes (for assistance)
- Exchange team tasks
- Internal technical conferences to share with each other
- Observe user behavior together and brainstorm optimization directions
- Invite a teammate from another team to join our work

**Summary**

> "Imagine that someone from Team A drops a feature that Team B needs, due to an urgent support issue. Without communicating this priority change to Team B, trust will be decreased even if it’s a justified priority change."

"[difference between transactional trust and relational/emotional trust](http://recoveringengineer.com/leadership-skills/the-two-sides-of-trust/){:target="_blank"}"
- Understand the difference between transactional trust and relational trust.
- Transactional trust — whether people will fulfill commitments and complete tasks
- Relational trust — whether people act in ways that build and protect relationships

### Lesson 7. — Optimize for business learning

Establish a culture of business learning rather than a culture of building, optimizing throughput, and optimizing value.
- Premature optimization is disastrous
- Focus on optimizing current problems, not optimizing for the sake of optimizing
- Even if not the project owner, we can still optimize internal operations; significant successes often come from small accumulations of optimization
- As managers, we must demonstrate the motivations behind our decisions
- Establish a culture of business learning (value) rather than a culture of building (the focus is not on building solutions, but on the business problems we are trying to solve)
- Optimizing efficiency vs. optimizing throughput:
  - Optimizing efficiency: solving the time for a single task
  - Optimizing throughput: how many tasks can be solved within a time frame (e.g., a quarter)
- Understand the impact of each optimization,
- The importance of automation (which can save time in the long run)

**Use the AARRR principle for value optimization:**
- Acquisition: How to bring in more users
- Activation: How to guide users to complete tasks that help them understand the product's value (e.g., alarm clock app, guiding new users to set an alarm)
- Retention: Increase revisit rates and usage frequency
- Referrer: Encourage your users and content to bring in more traffic
- Revenue: Digitally assess the revenue generated by users

These five aspects are interrelated; if retention is low, adjustments can be made to referrer and acquisition simultaneously.

As engineering managers, our role is not just to bury ourselves in code or immerse ourselves in technology; we should periodically realign with product value.

When the product is still in its early market testing phase, the focus should be on optimizing efficiency (quickly resolving tasks for release), repeating the following process:

Features that can enhance retention -> Release features -> Learn -> Adjust & Repeat.

Evaluate areas for optimization at each stage from feature assessment to release (spending too much time on design? On discussions?)

Can we invest 20% of the time to reduce 80% of development time? Especially on pain points.

Can we experiment or release to a minimal audience first? To avoid large features that ultimately no one uses.
- Proper data tracking is essential to understand the effectiveness of our efforts.

> "If you can’t make engineering decisions based on data, then make engineering decisions that result in data."

While the statement "not doing this feature will cause the company to collapse" is certainly more alarming than "this feature will lead to technical debt," as managers, we should strive to secure more time to address technical debt, ensuring effective communication and control.

Optimizing potentially unused code is not very meaningful.
- After the initial testing phase, when the product model stabilizes, it is more appropriate to optimize throughput (e.g., given X resources, achieve Y output)
- Provide predictability for business needs (as above)

Track team output (e.g., "01/01/2013–14/01/2013: 2 Large features, 5 Medium features, 4 Small"), and through long-term statistics, this can provide forecasts.

**Identify & resolve bottlenecks:**
- Synchronous communication: For example, in the product development process, design resources are needed; when entering the engineering development phase, do we already have clear specifications for development? Or are we still waiting? Is there something we can do in the meantime?
- Infrastructure: Ensure the code is easy to extend and maintain
- Automation: Use automation to handle tedious manual operations, saving time while avoiding errors

As business strategies change constantly, we should maintain a more open and flexible mindset towards optimization strategies, with the overall summary of optimization still focused on business needs.

### Lesson 8. — Use Inbound Recruiting to attract better talent


## Recruitment

Start doing the following things regularly to prevent a sudden talent shortage, which would force you to revert to traditional methods of finding people, leading to endless interviews but still struggling to find suitable candidates.

**Internal:**
- Cultivate a good engineering culture environment (e.g., Code Review, annual meetings…)
- Create an attractive work environment
- Manage it like a brand
- Team members work together
- Strengthen connections between people (e.g., birthday celebrations)
- Ensure that members feel proud of the team

**External:**
- Have the internal team regularly answer community questions (e.g., Stackoverflow…) to increase exposure
- Hide recruitment Easter eggs in the code (e.g., web developer tools)
- Share the problems and solutions our team encounters with the community (articles or talks)
- Organize hackathons
- Establish side projects (e.g., open-source projects)

Assign the above tasks to team members, and everyone contributes to finding good talent.

### Lesson 9. — Build a scalable team

Build a scalable team.

Establishing scalable programs is a responsibility that we previously held as engineers, but now the challenge is to build a scalable team.

Unlike programs, people have expectations, needs, and dreams to consider.

The author aims to create a happy work environment where teammates understand task expectations and new challenges; and to maintain this enthusiasm continuously.
- Align Goals
Align personal visions with company goals; if the current company goals are not understood, it can lead to team dysfunction.
- Align Core Values
This is about consensus and tacit understanding regarding how things are done and what is important; team core values are not static and must evolve with the times.
- Balance
Regarding team members' functions and growth, distribute different visions, autonomy, and ownership; collaborate to grow together (e.g., newcomers just want to understand the company's processes, while veterans want code reviews and guidance); everyone should have the potential for growth.
- The core values of the group are greater than the individual
This may lead to some people leaving, and it requires time and patience to realize; there are also many challenges (e.g., when someone leaves, they may question the core values).
- Sense of Achievement
Results should provide a sense of achievement; as a manager, you must not let teammates burn out their enthusiasm.

#### Practice

1. Define the team vision
For example, the author's team works on web scraping, and their team vision is "To build the largest, most informative profile-database in the world."
Note that this is a vision, not a short-term goal or something they do not want to pursue.

2. Define the team core values
When selecting core values, consider "Is this value important enough that someone could be fired for not adhering to it?"
Write down the core values and the reasons behind them.
The author provides the following core values he has written:
- Do not let others (other teams) clean up after you; your team's mistakes must be borne by yourselves.
- Maintain loyalty and respect for all team members.
With core values in place, recruitment or dismissal has clearer criteria, and there is a better basis for action.

#### Define Members' Expectations of the Team and Management
- Provide a productive and happy work environment
- Understand the Why of tasks rather than just the How
- Receive genuine feedback
- Have opportunities to lead other members
- Be able to share work results

#### Define Expectations for Team Members

Basic Expectations:
- Complete tasks
- Maintain a passion for learning
- Keep a passion for sharing and teaching
- Understand the baseline for doing things

Personal Expectations:
- Set expectations based on abilities
- Have the ability to train others to change
- Drive change rather than complain

We are a team; team members have their own responsibilities and deliverables, while also collaborating with others, helping each other, and growing together; defining expectations is like a contract, transforming the original colleague relationship into a managerial relationship, allowing for better and more purposeful leadership; defining these items is not easy and requires time and patience to iterate.
