### \[Travel Journal\] 2024 San'in Region Shimane Izumo Matsue Tottori Himeji Osaka Kobe 7-Day Solo Trip

Entering Okayama, first visiting the San'in region of Shimane, then Tottori, and finally returning to Himeji, Kansai, and Osaka; 7 days, 100,000 steps, traveling over 1,000 kilometers, exploring the San'in and Kansai regions.

Lake Shinji Sunset
#### Introduction

Initially, I planned to visit Sendai in the second half of 2024, but after checking the attractions, I found my interest was lukewarm for that time. Reflecting on my trip last year during the same week from 11/13 to 11/18 to **"[Sanyo Region Hiroshima Okayama 6-Day Free Trip](../31b9b3a63abc/)"**, I had a great impression of the Chugoku region, Sanyo, and Okayama ‚Äî beautiful scenery, convenient transportation, and fewer tourists. Therefore, I thought I would explore the San'in region (Shimane, Tottori) this time, especially since I had some free time at work and needed a break from recent stress; this led to my 7-day, 6-night solo trip to the San'in region (plus the Kansai region: Himeji, Osaka).
### Preparations
#### Dates: 11/12‚Äì18

This time, I had a sudden opportunity in mid-October, so I quickly arranged to depart on 11/12 and return on 11/18.
#### ‚úàÔ∏è Flights

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*XRfz2GcB_EiuvwxLYIFCTw.png)

This year, I didn't particularly rush to grab tickets for the Tigerair autumn promotion. **Last year, I managed to buy discounted tickets** that were better timed and cheaper ( `Last year: Departure (11:10), Return (15:25), including round trip 20KG checked baggage + seat selection + miscellaneous fees: NT$ 7,012` ).
- Departure: 13:05 TPE Taoyuan International Airport -> **16:30 OKJ** Okayama Momotaro Airport
- Return: **17:30 OKJ** Okayama Momotaro Airport -> 19:35 TPE Taoyuan International Airport
- Including round trip 20KG checked baggage + seat selection + miscellaneous fees price: `NT$ 9,118`

Not particularly cheap, but still acceptable; if I had chosen the same departure and return times as last year, it would have been more expensive, around `NT$ 12,000`.
#### Tigerair 2025 New Direct Flight Route

[In 2025, Tigerair will launch a new direct flight from "Taoyuan International Airport to Tottori Yonago Airport" starting May 29 (Thursday), making it even more convenient to visit the San'in region!](https://chugoku.letsgojp.com/archives/731900){:target="_blank"}
#### üèùÔ∏è Plan

Having never been to the San'in region and Himeji, I focused on these three places.
- 11/12 Arrive in Okayama in the evening, stay one night to prepare for the next morning's trip to Shimane
- 11/13 Take the JR train to Shimane early in the morning, first visit Izumo Taisha and Inasa Beach, then in the evening go to Lake Shinji to watch the sunset
- 11/14 Morning visit to Matsue Castle, Matsue Horikawa River cruise in the afternoon, then visit Adachi Art Museum, and arrive in Tottori in the evening
- 11/15 Morning visit to Hakuto Shrine, afternoon at Tottori Sand Dunes, and arrive in Himeji in the evening
- 11/16 Himeji Castle and shopping in Himeji city
Actual visit: Shoshazan Engyoji Temple
- 11/17 Ohnaruto Bridge Walkway, Naruto Whirlpools, Akashi Kaiky≈ç Bridge
Due to bad weather, I didn't go as planned and instead went shopping and eating in Osaka and Kobe.
- 11/18 Shopping at Okayama Station and return trip

#### üöÖ Transportation - [**Japan JR PASS | Kansai & San'in Region Rail Pass | eMCO Electronic Ticket**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20307-jr-sanin-okayama-area-pass?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}

This time, since there was a lot of long-distance travel, I had to buy a JR Pass. I was initially worried that there would only be JR Passes for the San'in and Sanyo regions, but I was pleasantly surprised that Japan JR thoughtfully planned all possible routes, and the "[**Kansai & San'in Region Rail Pass JRPass**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20307-jr-sanin-okayama-area-pass?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}" was just what I needed!

[Kansai & San'in Region Rail Pass JRPass Usable Range](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20307-jr-sanin-okayama-area-pass?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}
- Price: `NT$ 3,779` Plus an additional [**San'in and Sanyo Area 3-Day Pass (very cost-effective when used together)**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20307-jr-sanin-okayama-area-pass?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}

#### üì±Internet

This time, I also bought the "[**Japan eSIM Card | Daily High-Speed, Unlimited Data Plans | 35% Off**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137689-japan-high-speed-daily-unlimited-data-japanese-esim?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}" from KKday.
- 7-Day Unlimited Data eSIM Plan
- Price: `NT$ 847`

It worked very well, was stable, and I didn't encounter any speed reduction or disconnection issues.

> _The activation method and precautions for eSIM will be included in this article, please continue reading._ 

#### Japanese Yen

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*ljW0bI5fjkI2Xasi4KvA5A.jpeg)

I exchanged for new Japanese banknotes.

> _It is recommended to carry both new and old banknotes, as some vending machines cannot accept new notes._

#### üè†Accommodation

This time I was lucky to have only one night in Matsue without a reservation at [Toyoko Inn](https://www.toyoko-inn.com/china/index2){:target="_blank"}, but I managed to book the others.

**11/12 [Toyoko Inn Okayama Station East Exit](https://www.toyoko-inn.com/china/search/detail/00232/){:target="_blank"} (one night)**

![4 minutes walk from Okayama Station](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Kidzn6hm372657rCN8jTgw.png)

4 minutes walk from Okayama Station
- Non-Smoking Twin Room, Occupancy: 1 person
- Price: `NT$ 1,616`

**11/13 [Matsue Urban Hotel](https://www.station.matsue-urban.co.jp/en/){:target="_blank"} (one night)**

![2 minutes walk from Matsue Station](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*9QIJ7lY1W7L94dgKGm6VQQ.png)

2 minutes walk from Matsue Station
- Double Room with Small Double Bed ‚Äî Non-Smoking ‚Äî Building 2
Occupancy: 1 person
- Price: `NT$ 2,431`

**11/14 [Toyoko Inn Tottori Station South Exit](https://www.toyoko-inn.com/china/search/detail/00046/){:target="_blank"} (one night)**

![4 minutes walk from Tottori Station](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*hIqnM7MaRDWsRoRsydTqCg.png)

4 minutes walk from Tottori Station
- Non-Smoking Double Room, Occupancy: 1 person
- Price: `NT$ 1,595`

**11/15 [Toyoko Inn Himeji Station Shinkansen North Exit](https://www.toyoko-inn.com/china/search/detail/00317/){:target="_blank"} (three nights)**

![5 minutes walk from Himeji Station](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*P4xut5p60ZVSDtPkpoO6Pw.png)

5 minutes walk from Himeji Station
- Non-Smoking Double Room, Occupancy: 1 person
- Price: `NT$ 6,055`, `NT$ 2,018` / night

Although I managed to book almost all Toyoko Inns, I still ended up with a higher price for one night due to the late booking time, as only double rooms were available. If I had booked a single room type, I could have kept it under `NT$ 1,500` per night; however, based on past experience, as the date approaches, even double rooms tend to be fully booked, possibly because the location is less frequented?

> _A room unboxing video will be included in this article, please continue reading._

#### Tigerair Online Self Check-in

You will receive a travel notification email from Tigerair about 1 to 3 days before departure. **Be sure! Be sure! Be sure!** Complete the online "self check-in" directly before departure:

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*3K4biik6RnLXrqp453siiA.png)

After clicking on self check-in, you will be directed to the Tigerair official website to confirm passenger information and luggage safety, and finally, a "boarding pass" will be generated and sent.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*oupKW1tFwXdEwj4pEAL8hw.png)

Keep the boarding pass safe; with this, you can go directly to the airport and use "self-service baggage drop" to check in your luggage, saving time from waiting in long lines at the "regular check-in" counters.

### Day 1 (11/12 Tuesday) Departure

The flight is at 13:05 in the afternoon, so I woke up at 8 AM and left around 9 AM, which is more than enough time.

![[2024/11 Screenshot from Pre-Check-in Official Website](https://www.taoyuan-airport.com/ITCI/index.html){:target="_blank"}](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*LyhBB17WajIUYryRUrIgaA.png)

[2024/11 Screenshot from Pre-Check-in Official Website](https://www.taoyuan-airport.com/ITCI/index.html){:target="_blank"}

Tigerair [**Pre-Check-in Service (Check in and drop luggage at the MRT, go directly to exit at the airport)**](https://www.taoyuan-airport.com/ITCI/index.html){:target="_blank"} can only be done at **MRT A3 New Taipei Industrial Park Station**; it cannot be done at Taipei Main Station, so I took the MRT directly to Terminal 1.

#### ~= 10:00 Arrive at the Airport

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*4_ZTToEL1W6fwNWpo_GvBw.jpeg)

I arrived at the airport around 10:00 and had to wait until 10:20 for the counter to open.

#### ~= 10:20 Queue for "Self-Service Baggage Drop" to check in luggage

```markdown
![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*4y0Kgdbk8bbcUgajmi27IQ.png)

![Outbound: 9 KG](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*5_TKj5PZ-iUMi3r3CqrmzA.png)

Outbound: 9 KG

At this point, the advantage of checking in online through the Tigerair website became apparent. On that day, the "regular check-in" counters were packed with long lines, and by 10:20, they were already full, with an estimated wait time of at least 45 minutes to an hour. Meanwhile, the "self-service baggage check-in" took less than 15 minutes to complete, saving a lot of waiting time.

> _Completing online check-in on-site and then going to queue for "self-service baggage check-in" is much faster than waiting in line for "regular check-in."_

#### ~= 10:50 Completed Departure

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*aD3atJOMZWAhStzpdoaZDg.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*OLORgiz8R6pOfG-m9P-aOw.jpeg)

This time, I was at Gate A1 in Terminal 1. \(Finally, no more shuttle bus rides\)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*MDpHGgVgU0QRH0BGFmzLbA.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*ZU4N6uWzEYhp_J2C3JE0Dg.png)

Previously, every time I came to Terminal 1, I would eat at Tasty, but this time I opted for Lao Dong Beef Noodles, conveniently located near Gate A1.

#### ~= 11:30 Waiting for Boarding

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Xaux1WjOTpXcqxeF1-UlXw.jpeg)

After eating, I wandered around a bit around 11:30. The downside of Gate A1 is that it is far from the [**First Terminal Free VIP Lounge**](../cb65fd5ab770/), and since I was too lazy to walk back and forth, I went directly to the waiting area.

I took care of two internet issues beforehand. The first was that my [**Chunghwa Telecom roaming function was turned off**](https://123.cht.com.tw/IVRredir/){:target="_blank"}, and I couldn't purchase a roaming plan directly. So, I called Chunghwa Telecom to unlock the roaming function just in case.

![Need to call Chunghwa Telecom and confirm personal information for customer service to unlock.](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*dF9XuqFK3bW2X249DYtqZg.png)

Need to call Chunghwa Telecom and confirm personal information for customer service to unlock.

#### Pre-activating eSIM (Example for iPhone)

The second internet issue was to activate the eSIM at the airport. Since activating the eSIM requires a network connection, I was worried about the stability of the WiFi at Kaohsiung Airport, so I entered the activation for the Japanese eSIM while I was still in Taiwan with a stable internet connection.

> _If you're still worried about network issues causing problems upon entry, **you can also take a screenshot of the entry QR Code** or write out a physical entry card as a double safeguard._

Previously, the [eSIM I bought in Thailand could be added directly by long-pressing the QR Code in the purchase certificate email, PDF, or screenshot](../b7e7c0938985/), but the Japanese eSIM I bought this time did not show that option:

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*su5YVQrLdjFXORHuiMZxuw.png)

**I found a method provided by a [netizen](https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/iOS/M.1719797706.A.916.html){:target="_blank"} that successfully brings up the "Add eSIM" option. \(It seems to be an iOS bug that broke after iOS 17.4\):**

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*DrYXYUfGj_BddPe8FwbM4A.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Z-Ls2JPUbJAw93L7ey91gw.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*BwNRm45uuwJcWjnYicDIEA.png)

1. Go to the eSIM certificate email or PDF, take a screenshot, and save it in the photo album.
2. Open the phone camera and tap the bottom left corner to enter the album.
3. Find the eSIM photo in the album, long-press the QR Code, and the "Add eSIM" option will appear.
4. Click "Add eSIM" to directly input the activation information and activate the eSIM.

#### Manually Activating eSIM on iPhone

**Go to "Settings" -> "Cellular" -> "Add eSIM" -> "Use Mobile Barcode":**

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*TUIEbNDhczwvTehfFza_sg.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*7hYiMadhEnU5NOt58ashJw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*YUjZUpfB6BeLQKNWTMx-5A.png)
```

I printed the eSIM QR code, so I activated it by scanning it directly from here.

If you have nothing, you can click "Manually enter details" to copy and paste the eSIM certificate information for manual activation:

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*TdmMDosao98OATMJNa0NLw.png)

Fill in the corresponding email content with the `SM-DP+ address`, `activation code`, and `confirmation code` (there's none this time), then click next to complete the activation.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*cXjnkvYvDGnE-ByT3hcnaw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*sc6xr-nA3J_BdYMcNBNMFA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Rh7hWbEiUtLbR3VYXq9NOw.png)

After entering, it will take some time to activate. It may get stuck on "Activating..." for a while or show activation failure messages like "try again later"; just wait a little longer, and it should be successful. Once activated, it will show "On" in "Settings" -> "Mobile Services," and the signal icon will appear in the upper right corner, displaying the signal status below.
- The mobile plan label can be selected as "Travel"

> **_We are still in Taiwan and cannot connect to the eSIM Japan network for now; just confirm that the activation is successful._**

#### ~= 12:20 Boarding begins, no delays

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*R1I1UY831lnjto_6jqwCFw.jpeg)

#### ~= 13:05 On time for takeoff

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*ovXkaMS4yzLWpm2_YBTPFw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*IQ1kIFLjFgrYHUqulJMO7Q.jpeg)

At this time, it started to rain heavily in Taiwan, but there wasn't much wind, so it didn't affect the takeoff much.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Ooxdur72IKkRc4u5q52esQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*ECU47qVPUd7cv6UcBy6i3Q.jpeg)

I think the comfort level of Tigerair's seats is quite excellent among budget airlines (compared to Peach's small seats and VietJet's uncomfortable chairs), but the downside of Tigerair is [**prohibiting bringing food**](https://www.threads.net/@kechi.syonen/post/DCYnEQNzU5L/%E4%BB%80%E9%BA%BC%E8%83%BD%E5%B8%B6%E4%B8%8A%E9%A3%9B%E6%A9%9F%E4%BB%80%E9%BA%BC%E4%B8%8D%E8%83%BD%E5%B8%B6%E5%BE%88%E6%B8%85%E6%A5%9A%E4%BB%99%E5%8F%B0%E6%A9%9F%E5%A0%B4){:target="_blank"}, and I just ate, so I'm not hungry!

There is no WiFi on board, so I can only listen to music and play offline games.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*y36b_kkD7RMz1R501bPkIw.png)

After landing in Japan, our Japan eSIM should be able to receive a signal.

> _If there is a signal but still cannot access the internet, go to "Settings" -> "Mobile Services" -> select **Travel Japan eSIM** -> confirm that "Enable this number" and **turn on "Data Roaming" to have internet! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è**_

> _Additionally, you can also access the **main Chunghwa Telecom** number. If you did not purchase Chunghwa Telecom's roaming plan, please remember to **turn off "Data Roaming" and "Enable this number" here to keep it activated, so you can receive messages from Taiwan!**_

> **_Please note: Do not answer calls casually; receiving domestic calls while overseas will incur charges! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è (Only receiving messages is free)_**

#### ~= 17:00 Completed immigration and baggage claim
- Okayama Momotaro Airport is a very small airport, with only one international flight at a time (just this flight). Follow the people from the same flight to immigration and baggage claim, which is quick.
(This flight seemed to be nearly full, and it took about 30 minutes to come out.)
- An unexpected thing is that the airport staff can all speak Chinese.
- Perhaps because the small airport is stricter, those traveling alone like me were almost all asked how many days they would stay and which places they would visit. Some were even asked to show hotel reservations.
(So if you are going alone, please prepare in advance to respond.)

#### Airport WiFi

#### Reserve JR Reserved Seats


This is very important. According to the information provided by the [JR Pass Kansai & San'in Area Pass official website](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/tc/ticket/pass/kansai_sanin/){:target="_blank"}, the [**JR YAKUMO ÂÖ´Èõ≤ „ÇÑ„Åè„ÇÇ train to the San'in region has all reserved seats**](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/tc/ticket/pass/pdf/Reserved_seats_tc.pdf){:target="_blank"} **, with no non-reserved seats ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è (starting from ** March 16, 2024 **), reservations must be made in advance.**


> _You should also be able to make reservations online. [Previously, I made an online reservation from Hakata to Yufuin on JR](https://medium.com/ztravel/%E9%81%8A%E8%A8%98-2024-%E4%BA%8C%E8%A8%AA%E4%B9%9D%E5%B7%9E-9-%E6%97%A5%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E8%A1%8C-%E7%B6%93%E9%87%9C%E5%B1%B1-%E5%8D%9A%E5%A4%9A%E9%83%B5%E8%BC%AA%E5%85%A5%E5%A2%83-cb65fd5ab770?source=collection_home---4------1-----------------------){:target="_blank"}, just need to check it out._

**JR Pass Reserved Seat Booking Process:**
- The [**JR Pass Kansai & San'in Area Pass**](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/tc/ticket/pass/kansai_sanin/){:target="_blank"} **allows you to use machines to reserve seats up to 6 times; for more, you need to go to a ticket counter. The number of reservations and restrictions vary by region, please refer to the official website for information.**
- First, check the English names of your departure location and the destination **JR station**, for example: OKAYAMA (Â≤°Â±±) -> MATSUE (ÊùæÊ±ü)
- Please note that it is the English name of the JR station, _so [to go to Fukuoka, you need to type Hakata](../d78e0b15a08a/)_ XD
- The first step is to select "Traditional Chinese."
- The second step is to insert a "JR Pass ticket."
(If traveling with multiple people, you will need to continue inserting in the fourth step.)
- Follow the steps in the video below to complete the reservation:

> _The video shows the entire process of making a reservation from Yasugi Station to Tottori Station._ 
 

> _\(There was no one at the automatic ticket machine at that station, so I dared to take out my phone and record the whole process\)_

- Due to the schedule and tomorrow's itinerary, I reserved the 07:05 train to first drop off my luggage at the hotel in Matsue.
- **You still need to use the JR Pass to enter and exit the station \(the ticket above\)** ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è, the reserved ticket is just to let you know your carriage and seat number.

After casually buying a fried beef steak bento and some snacks and drinks from the convenience store at Okayama Station, I went to the hotel to rest; Okayama Station is under renovation, and I will return to Okayama on the last day of my trip.


![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*5OK4O6vRpvTbBHY1or45Ww.jpeg)



It takes about five minutes to walk from the Momotaro Shopping Street to the hotel.
#### ~= 19:00 Return to the hotel for dinner and rest

The portion of the bento is a bit small, but the Okayama white peach in this can of peach wine is delicious! Plus, the nostalgic hot dogs and fried chicken from the Japanese convenience store (FamilyMart) made for a satisfying evening; good night, Okayama! Preparing for an early start tomorrow for the trip in Japan.
#### [Okayama Korakuen Illumination](http://genso-teien.okayama.jp/){:target="_blank"}

This year's 2024 Okayama Korakuen illumination will be from November 15 (Friday) to November 24 (Sunday), and it wasn't happening on the day I visited; if there is illumination, it's worth checking out, as it's very beautiful.

The train is quite comfortable, with luggage areas in the front and back for easy storage, and the seats have charging ports.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*M8ciQoiAy5GWHQoa34vo1w.png)


The total journey takes about 2 hours and 45 minutes, and you can feel the scenery changing as you travel through the mountains. Early in the morning, many areas are still shrouded in mist, giving a sense of entering a paradise through a cave; unfortunately, I didn't get a window seat, so I could only view the scenery from afar.
#### 09:49 Arrive at Matsue

The weather in Matsue is fantastic ‚òÄÔ∏è. After arriving at Matsue Station, I headed directly to the hotel where I will be staying tonight, [**Matsue Urban Hotel**](https://www.station.matsue-urban.co.jp/en/){:target="_blank"}, to drop off my luggage.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*58UjwwimiMZZS5fhCc2o7w.jpeg)


After dropping off my luggage, I returned to Matsue Station around 10:00 and rebooked my seat for the 10:48 Yakumo train from Matsue to Izumo City.


> **_I should have booked the seat from Okayama to Matsue yesterday and also booked a seat from Matsue to Izumo City_**, _because I wanted to see the sunset in the afternoon, so I dropped off my luggage in Matsue first; otherwise, I would have gone directly to Izumo City without wasting time changing trains._ 





> _Alternatively, you can take the Ichibata Electric Railway Daisha Line to Izumo Taisha, which takes about the same amount of time._

There was still some time, so I ran to the convenience store to buy two rice balls, coffee, and fried chicken for lunch.

On the way, I passed by Lake Shinji, which is super large. At first, I thought it was the sea, but it‚Äôs actually a lake.

> _You can only reserve a window seat at D to see Lake Shinji directly. I reserved A, which is by the mountain, so I can't see it QQ._

#### 11:12 Arrived at Izumo City

After arriving at Matsue Station, I jogged to catch the 11:25 Ichibata Electric Railway North Matsue Line to Kawato Station.

> _You cannot use a transportation card to enter the Ichibata Electric Railway. You need to buy a ticket at the automatic ticket machine at the entrance (electronic payment is accepted). If you don‚Äôt know how to buy it, just tell the station staff you want to go to `Izumo Taisha` (Âá∫Èõ≤Â§ßÁ§æ)._

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*hqp8E0znWzflcoF_wdXbYA.jpeg)

At Kawato Station, I needed to transfer (follow everyone to the opposite platform) to the Ichibata Electric Railway Taisha Line to go to Izumo Taisha-mae Station.
#### Arrived at Izumo Taisha around 12 o'clock

The approach to the main shrine is very serene and beautiful. If you have time, there are many small shops and delicious foods to explore here.

> _I later found out that the four torii gates in Izumo are also very famous. One of the large white torii gates can be found by walking in the opposite direction from the station approach towards the shrine:_

Walking up to the entrance of Izumo Taisha, I arrived on `2024/11/13`, which happens to be during the **Kami Matsuri** period (`2024 Reiwa Year 6, 11/11~11/17`), so there were many Japanese people coming to pay their respects.

> _Every year in the lunar month of October (Gregorian November), all eight million deities gather in Izumo for a "divine council" to discuss human affairs, such as fate arrangements and harmony with nature._

> _Therefore, **this month is called "Kannazuki" (the month without gods) in other parts of Japan, and there are usually no festivals.**_

> **_Only in Izumo is it called "Kamiarizuki," meaning only the Izumo region has gods._**

> _Festivals include the "Kaminomi Matsuri" to welcome the deities, the "Enmusubi Taikai" to pray for good relationships, and the "Kamiokuri Matsuri" to send off the deities._

> **_Izumo Taisha enshrines the main deity: Okuninushi no Mikoto (Â§ßÂõΩ‰∏ªÂëΩ)._**

It was quite a coincidence that when I was arranging the schedule, I didn‚Äôt intentionally choose this time. I only found out while checking the information about the attractions.

After passing through the entrance torii gate, you will need to walk for about 5 more minutes to reach the shrine.
#### Japan's Largest "Nihon Maru" National Flag

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*WBerwVlV_I8PeYqj2KRX1w.png)

Upon entering the shrine, look to the left to see a tall flagpole, which holds Japan's largest Nihon Maru flag (approximately 75 tatami mats, 137 square meters).

Walking towards this flagpole will lead you to the "Kagura Hall," where you can find Japan's largest [shimenawa](https://sanin-japan.com/zh-tw/special/territory-of-the-gods-yokozuna-and-izumo-taisha/){:target="_blank"}.

Up close, it is truly enormous, especially compared to the regular shimenawa of other halls, which is about ten times smaller. (Length: 14 meters, Weight: 5 tons, replaced every few years, handmade)

> _Please remember that the largest one is here at the "Kagura Hall," don't make the same mistake I did thinking it was at the main hall._

Due to time constraints, I didn't visit other shrines in Izumo, and without a car, it felt quite difficult to collect them.
#### ~= 12:45 Walk to Inasa no Hama Beach

I walked back to the Izumo Taisha bus station to prepare for the bus back to JR Izumo Station.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*AqsQ2S3q61tJaq7k6fgdIA.jpeg)

You can see the vehicles lined up waiting to enter the parking lot of Izumo Taisha for worship.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*XrDT2aXpUPfF7NT5IEFFNA.jpeg)

The Izumo Taisha bus station is located behind the restroom after passing through the souvenir shop. It‚Äôs quite small, and I was initially worried about waiting in the wrong place.

**At this time, around 13:15, I had to wait for the 13:40 bus back to JR Izumo Station. I was very hungry, so I went to the souvenir shop in front to buy some snacks to eat.**

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*FYPk9dJKH166TgfMJbKinA.jpeg)

I bought a few quirky stickers at the souvenir shop.

> _On the way back to Izumo, I met a Japanese person who borrowed my power bank because his phone was completely dead.

#### ~= 14:15 Arrived back at JR Izumo Station

(Heading to see the sunset at Lake Shinji before it sets, according to information, **the sun sets at 17:05 that day**)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*JxPpTZphqlQpjXjOlEmRfA.jpeg)

This time, I didn't take the Yakumo train and instead took the 14:54 local train to Matsue, following Google Maps' suggestion to get off at Nogi Station and walk to the sunset viewing spot at Lake Shinji.

Noguchi Station is very small, with no station staff and no ticket machines. **If you have a JR Pass, just exit directly without foolishly leaving your JR Pass in the ticket box. ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è**

Walking from Noguchi Station was a bit of a miscalculation; this area is quite desolate with not many people around...

However, fortunately, there was a 7-Eleven along the way where I bought a hot dog, fried chicken, and a drink to enjoy while waiting for the sunset.

#### 16:45 Sunset

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*rmwJe1rnyjhQkJ9erx7q_w.jpeg)

At first, I didn't feel much, but as the sunset approached, I began to appreciate the charm of the first sunset, and the heron just happened to blend into the scenery.

As the sun neared the horizon, it disappeared at a visible speed, with the sun descending every minute and second.

Before long, at 17:01, the sun was no longer visible.

Finally, I took a look around at the [Sunset Viewing Stair Platform](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LRQAMZNht9km1DFm6){:target="_blank"} at the people watching the sunset together.

#### 18:00 Return to Matsue Station, Hotel
#### Buy some souvenirs at the gift shop on the first floor of Matsue Station

I thought it would be special to buy souvenirs here in the San'in region.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*fQj5GAdIRZ8uKKofUerGSw.png)


What‚Äôs special is the beef bone soup ramen, which is usually pork bone; I bought a box to taste back in Taiwan.

This building does not have an elevator; I booked a room in Building 2, which can be accessed by crossing the bridge from the main lobby. On the second floor of Building 2, there is a lounge with a microwave, laundry room, and vending machines.


> _The atmosphere in Building 2 doesn‚Äôt feel very safe; the elevator has no access control, and [the 1st and 2nd floors are capsule hotels](https://www.cubic-room.jp/en/){:target="_blank"}, which feels a bit complicated to enter and exit, and it‚Äôs a distance from the main lobby. Therefore, after checking in, I used my suitcase to block the door, fearing that strange people might come in._

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*rNzPDu9gW2s89oW0oqxWSA.jpeg)

Check-in, then went outside to find something to eat. It was quite cold, dark, and desolate outside, so I quickly went to the restaurants around the station to get takeout and bought some food and drinks from the convenience store before heading back to the hotel.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*FaaPod-j1hdncbRKhnNUOQ.jpeg)

The beef tongue bento was delicious, and the sparkling peach wine I bought from the convenience store was also good.

> _Good night, Matsue._

**I also bought almost the same breakfast set every day...**

This fruit juice from FamilyMart is a must-have every time I come to Japan!

I stumbled upon this YouTube channel where you can see the weather and scenery of Shinjiko Lake.
### Day 3 (11/14 Thursday) Matsue Horikawa Sightseeing Boat, Matsue Castle, Adachi Art Museum

In the morning, I first left my luggage at the hotel and took the bus from Matsue Bus Station to Matsue Castle for the boat tour.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*6Urhj-Bh4CXFgweozc99fQ.png)

Google Maps doesn't show the platform, so I had to check on-site. The bus from platform 2 goes to Matsue Castle.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*4i5NFX226vWGW4yTEqOqIw.jpeg)

I got off in front of the Citizens' Hall and walked towards Matsue Castle. You can see the "Horikawa Sightseeing Boat" boarding area near the parking lot.

Switch to "Use," fill out the health questionnaire, and after completing it, a QR code camera will appear; scan the QR code provided by the store and show the result to complete the exchange.

You can also click "Target Content" to view redeemable items.

> **_The actual calculation time starts from the first redemption target_** _and not from when the serial number is activated (I entered it on 11/13)._ 

**Here are some popular locations where you can use it:**
- Shinjiko Lake sightseeing boat, original price 1,800 yen
- Matsue Castle boat tour, original price 1,600 yen

#### 09:15 Take the Matsue sightseeing boat

You can directly use the [3-Day Pass](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20307-jr-sanin-okayama-area-pass?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} for free rides.
- This year is relatively warm, and the heated table boat has not been changed yet.
- There will be four bridge points where the boat needs to lower its body, so be careful not to pinch your hands.
- The entire journey takes about 50 minutes.
- **You must take off your shoes before boarding** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Only the row facing the boatman can capture the view of Matsue Castle; the farther you are from the boatman, the closer you are to the bow (= the first row of seats when you just enter)** ‚ö†Ô∏è As shown in the picture below.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*mycuhLZJdCqQCLjmdKBVuA.jpeg)

Let's board the boat.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*7hUFpDj5m7TYkRzY_QhrOA.jpeg)

Perhaps because the maple leaf season has not yet started, there are not many people; there are only four others on the boat, making it quite spacious.

[![Matsue Horikawa Sightseeing Boat Passing Under Bridges](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/81ca_hqdefault.jpg "Matsue Horikawa Sightseeing Boat Passing Under Bridges")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dP7cQcqkW8){:target="_blank"}

When passing under the four bridges, the boat will lower its body, so you need to bend down slightly to pass through.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*mqX7jwzT8WnOhg9hwZKZPA.jpeg)

The gentle breeze while cruising is very pleasant, and the boatman will introduce the historical sites around (although I could only understand "hidari" for left and "migi" for right...).

![[https://youtube\.com/shorts/KA9xKZV16bk](https://youtube.com/shorts/KA9xKZV16bk){:target="_blank"}](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*vY1xPWmFrFq7m4ErBFYRAQ.jpeg)

[https://youtube\.com/shorts/KA9xKZV16bk](https://youtube.com/shorts/KA9xKZV16bk){:target="_blank"}

Finally, near the return point, there is a spot to photograph Matsue Castle, where you can capture a distant view of the castle.

The boat ride ends around 10:00.
#### 10:15 Matsue Castle

After returning from the boat ride, walk back in the direction you came from; on the other side is the entrance to Matsue Castle. Walk up, and you will reach Matsue Castle.

Passing by Matsue Shrine, we arrive at Matsue Castle.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*rrtm3CezY7W1ZWPIbj5p-A.jpeg)

Due to time constraints, I wanted to continue to the Adachi Art Museum, so I did not go up.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*J13Zlai29b-V7OR6-NSDuw.jpeg)

After arriving at the station, I also went to reserve a seat on the Yakumo 14 limited express train to Anrai (ÂÆâÊù•) (Adachi Museum of Art).

Upon arriving at Anrai Station, don't rush to exit. Find the tourist information center where you can store large luggage. 
(There are lockers outside the station, but they are mostly full.)
#### 11:30 Taking the shuttle bus to Adachi Museum of Art

[For the latest timetable, please refer to the official website](https://www.adachi-museum.or.jp/en/shuttle-bus){:target="_blank"}

After storing my luggage, I took the shuttle bus to the Adachi Museum of Art (free, boarding in order). There weren't many people when I arrived in the morning.

After passing through the countryside for about 20 minutes, we arrived at the Adachi Museum of Art.

Again, I used the [3-Day Pass](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20307-jr-sanin-okayama-area-pass?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} to exchange for free admission.

The first thing to do is to collect the corresponding "shuttle bus ticket" at the front desk according to your itinerary, one ticket per person; return to the drop-off point at the scheduled time with the ticket to take the bus back to Anrai Station.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*mxWMQacl1bNSfdRo8X9JQA.png)

My itinerary is to take the JR train departing from Anrai to Tottori at 14:46. Please note that **there are not many trains to Tottori‚ö†Ô∏è.**

> **_Very important! Very important! Very important! You must take it, otherwise, there is no guarantee you will have a seat on the train.‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è_**

> _I was the one who didn't know to take it. I originally planned to take the 13:00 train, but I found out I needed to take the ticket and had to go back to get it, so I changed to the 13:35 train back to Anrai._

> _Fortunately, I had allowed plenty of time._

#### Adachi Museum of Art ‚Äî Japan's Best Garden

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*U6yP0ur5hbX5RPLBCUJhOA.jpeg)

In addition to the garden, the core of the Adachi Museum of Art is its extensive collection of artworks, photography is prohibited, and visitors follow the designated path to view the artworks along with the garden.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*wBCdJ9HmdU55eywoII8eZQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*ftl17PV6R9Xvj6u_W2uTeg.jpeg)

Outside, you can see part of the garden landscape, and you can feel that a lot of time and effort has been spent maintaining this scenery.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*tcvXnD0yZU2J36q-7DFPPw.jpeg)

Inside, there are two tea rooms, which not only serve desserts and coffee but also offer hot meals; it's a good idea to stop here to rest, eat something, and enjoy the view.

> _Since I came alone, I didn't stop to eat anything._ 

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*r-y6_oqYcCr7gHBkO2htAw.png)

I bought a cardboard reproduction of a collection piece I saw at the souvenir shop, [Yokoyama Taikan's "Mt. Fuji" painting](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/mt-fuji/gQGjCiwQOJy4bg?hl=zh-TW){:target="_blank"} as a souvenir.

#### 12:30 Strolling in the Outdoor Shopping Street

There is a small shopping street outside, and since it was still early, I wandered around aimlessly.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*IIi5iKRgO4Z3X-WVGXSAlg.jpeg)

As mentioned earlier, I initially didn't know to take a numbered ticket, so I foolishly waited for the bus. It wasn't until 13:00 that I realized I couldn't board and went to get a ticket for 13:35.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*_qEUfX9ZPhw4e7GoCkd1mA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*CYcgaIGY63OyZ8AVqxp6zQ.jpeg)

After getting the ticket, I re-entered (re-entry is allowed) and sat in the indoor viewing area to relax and enjoy the scenery while waiting for the bus.

#### 13:55 Back at Anrai Station

On the way back to Anrai Station, I saw some bright red maple leaves.

At this time, there were actually more people heading to the Adachi Museum of Art.

The train model is quite old and only has two cars (one for non-reserved seats and one for reserved seats). My 26-inch suitcase couldn't fit in the overhead luggage rack (the new JR trains can accommodate it, but this model is too small). I forgot that I could walk to the last row and place it behind the last row of seats, so I had to cram it into my own space.

Fortunately, there was no one next to me the whole way. The non-reserved seat car looked more crowded, while the reserved seat side was only about 60% full.

> _Due to the itinerary, I didn't specifically visit the Gegege no Kitaro Station (Sakaiminato Station) and the Conan Station (Yura Station)._

Heading to tonight's hotel [**Toyoko Inn Tottori Station South Exit**](https://www.toyoko-inn.com/china/search/detail/00046/){:target="_blank"}, there is also a Toyoko Inn at the North Exit, but I couldn't book it. The North Exit area is livelier with shopping streets.

With an hour until dinner, I decided to browse around the nearby AEON.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*mOuFR0sVsVoQ1RxuPH3YlA.jpeg)

Around 18:00, I walked to the Tottori North Exit shopping street to find something to eat. I had been eating randomly for the past few days, so today I wanted to find a better restaurant.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*_Qkjzr6Xf_PV642XoYTcgw.jpeg)

I found a well-reviewed Tottori Wagyu restaurant on the street ‚Äî ‚Äú[Meat Cuisine Nick](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pSZF8bCsiRNJ4aSt6){:target="_blank"}‚Äù to taste Tottori Wagyu. I was the only one there, probably because it was a weekday.

> _Although Tottori Wagyu is not as famous as Kobe Beef or Omi Beef, Tottori is the **birthplace of Japanese Wagyu culture**._

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*sI_cXfEuxYrVLS6SUqDArQ.png)

I ordered the ‚ÄúTottori Wagyu Hitsumabushi,‚Äù which is three ways to enjoy Tottori Wagyu rice for 3,500 yen, significantly cheaper than Kobe Beef.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*qkqZMeWtQcobrIOS8mrBJw.jpeg)

Tottori Wagyu is very tender, but it has a milder beef flavor; the first way to eat it, just the Wagyu, doesn‚Äôt have much taste.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*jkud_7mVWN_F6ALBWCj14g.jpeg)

The second and third ways, combined with the soup provided, turn it into a delicious chazuke.

#### 18:30 Finished eating and returned to the station and hotel.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*ZDMJBQeQx2jvWFpFmbhB9g.jpeg)

I also bought some late-night snacks to eat back at the hotel, including a Y1000 Yakult. I actually didn‚Äôt drink much this time but still slept well‚Ä¶

### Day 4 \(11/15 Friday\) Hakuto Shrine, Tottori Sand Dunes, Himeji

In the morning, I first visited Hakuto Shrine (for relationships) to pray, then walked from the north exit of Tottori Station to the bus terminal, passing through the bus hall to platform 4 to wait for the bus.

According to Google Maps, I took the Hakuto Coast Line bus from the Shikano office 41 to Hakuto Shrine.

Alternatively, you can buy a one-day sightseeing transportation ticket at Tottori Station, which is more economical.

Before getting off, pay the amount displayed on the screen. Since we boarded without a ticket at the terminal, we paid the amount shown for the first section.

#### ~= 09:30 Arrived at Hakuto Shrine

After getting off, walk towards the pedestrian bridge to find the entrance to Hakuto Shrine.
```

> _The White Rabbit Shrine originates from the legend of "Inaba no Shirousagi." In the legend, the deity Okuninushi (from Izumo Taisha) helps the injured white rabbit recover, receiving the rabbit's blessing and successfully winning the love of Princess Yashima._ 

> _The White Rabbit Shrine symbolizes good relationships and healing, and both shrines carry the sacred meaning of wishing for happiness and connections._

The distance to the shrine is not far, but there are many rabbit statues along the way, all piled with relationship stones.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*rXW71tg5gJJiOeVd5X3iRw.jpeg)

The bus to Tottori Station only comes at 10:45, so I think it would be better to come earlier to catch an earlier bus back to save time.

I met a tourist from Fujian, China, on the bus; his itinerary was the opposite of mine. He went to Himeji first and then to Shimane. We recommended attractions to each other; he suggested that I visit Shoshazan Engyoji first and then take photos at the scenic spot of Himeji Castle shown in the picture.

> **_Thank him! In the end, it felt very worthwhile._**

This bus requires you to get off at the East Entrance of the dunes.

> _The ticket number I received upon boarding was 3. When getting off, check the screen for the corresponding amount for number 3 and insert coins. For example, it requires 250 yen._

My confusing route of visit.

After getting off, turn back at the fork and follow the signs up, passing the Tottori Sand Dunes Art Museum, and continue walking to the entrance of the Tottori Sand Dunes.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*87V9nbswSrqQfx3JcDcVYQ.jpeg)

The Tottori Sand Dunes are truly vast. At this time, the weather is not favorable with some rain, but it would probably be very sunny if it were a clear day.
#### ~=12:00 Arrived at Tottori Sand Dunes

Japan's largest sand dune.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*WkiGJSHcUrPZi5h7zSJGYA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*lwqbSawD2wG3wO1MyAf2Bg.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*NEuDeBgnNxtTSaYVQCd2NQ.jpeg)

People look very small. I walked all the way to the ridge of the dunes; it was a bit shaky, and the sand was loose and difficult to walk on.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*S44sCcfn1C1zx3--fIIoBw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*w0d4u78ensGTedfoTINN4g.jpeg)

At the highest point, you can overlook the entire coastline. The view of the dunes facing the sea is unique to this location.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*B-Oqyt2XYx4TVTMblCdEdw.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*9ZoPtPjdHz3aaFTGNDT8iw.jpeg)

According to online information, it seems you can ride camels, but today it looks like they are not available due to the bad weather.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*9WiZqF_alWi6M1PrHwG3sg.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*JxF65EE6eeACd1uRENVwNQ.jpeg)

Finally, as I left the Tottori Sand Dunes, I took one last look back; they are truly massive. Some sand inevitably got into my shoes, **I saw some people directly putting on plastic shoe covers, which was very clever.**

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*6cq3xUwokLToOCx38TXV9g.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*OacuYCefS-wThnPRbo49xw.jpeg)

From here, you can take a cable car directly to the Tottori Sand Dunes Observatory. I thought I would first go down to eat the famous Tottori First Sand Dune Pudding, so I didn't take it; later, I walked up, which wasn't far (about 15 minutes).

Coming out from the parking lot, you can see the "Takahama Cafe" designed by Kengo Kuma across the street.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*YA0J3gRmOPgWhacPYV0LEg.jpeg)

I bought one to try, and it really tasted good; the pudding had a rich milk flavor and a texture like cheese.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*TafJZGPlGd5gft3gYj8Q3A.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*sF3liqjkM6eQ6KURqwEfxA.jpeg)

The specialty is that they give you a small packet of sugar that looks like sand to add and eat together.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*30_-rtFKE2Az1z6ikKIOSg.jpeg)

There are also some restaurants along the way where you can eat. Continuing back, there is a small path; if you walk up a little on the right, you will find the second entrance to the Sand Dune Art Museum, and if you go a bit further up on the left, you will reach the place where the cable car arrives, the "Tottori Sand Dune Observatory."

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*D9v4msXBz0mfsAWzXugtTw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*N9shdulrUJo5pphjg4lKMw.jpeg)

First, head left to the Tottori Sand Dune Observatory to enjoy the scenery and eat something; you will first arrive at the cable car boarding area.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*mo37aWPygCHfl-dAetnVQg.jpeg)

You can first go to the vending machine nearby to get a brush to clean the sand off your shoes. \(The staff at the entrance will also remind you\)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*gTZJLV-MjOhVf3kxsPHwmg.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*lQX5yEbrhiEqUxf6ekViVw.jpeg)

Finally, I also waited here for the bus back to Tottori.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*GLQ1-BDnEqB25ZBp2X3BAA.jpeg)

The observatory has souvenirs for sale on the first and second floors, and there is a small restaurant. You can go up to the third floor to overlook the Tottori Sand Dunes \(although there isn't much to see\).

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*fyEhTboh7RX-ZXqz9-FCPw.png)

The food options inside are also quite limited; you need to go to the nearby vending machine to buy the corresponding meal ticket, then enter and find a seat before handing the ticket to the staff.

I casually had an oyster set meal.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*bN0RPnkejfCFjKjmcGwNCw.png)

I also bought some Tottori souvenirs here.
#### 13:30 Sand Dune Art Museum

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*30_-rtFKE2Az1z6ikKIOSg.jpeg)

After eating, I walked down from Entrance 2 to explore the Sand Dune Art Museum. \(You can also enter for free using the [**3-Day Pass**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20307-jr-sanin-okayama-area-pass?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}\)

Starting from Entrance 2, the visit begins with the outdoor sand sculptures, then you walk down from the 3rd floor to the 2nd floor. There are only sand sculptures on the 2nd floor; the venue is not large, and if it weren't free, I probably wouldn't have come in.

After walking around, we headed back up to the Tottori Sand Dunes Observatory, swaying east and west while enjoying a Tottori pear ice cream. We waited for the bus to Tottori Station around 14:20 at the bus stop, and the bus arrived at 14:42.

> _When the bus back to Tottori arrived, it was already nearly full, and we squeezed on. If there‚Äôs time, it might be better to look for a bus from the previous stop._

#### 2025/01 Update

Upon returning, I found out that due to the inconvenient transportation in Tottori, they offer taxi charter day tours. [For details, please refer to the tourist center or this website](https://chugoku.letsgojp.com/archives/661034){:target="_blank"}.

I was assigned a room on the 14th floor, and the view outside the window was great.

You can look back at Himeji Station's railway directly from the window; there is a slight sound of the tracks when trains pass by, but fortunately, there are no trains after nightfall.

#### 19:00 Going Out to Wander and Find Food

As soon as I came out, I saw the night view of Himeji Castle and thought it was beautiful. I don't know what got into me, but I wanted to walk to Himeji Castle to take night photos. Being too close made it hard to capture good shots, so I didn't take many pictures and left. I was cold and hungry all the way; I should have gone straight to eat.

Himeji Castle is about 1 kilometer from the station, and the round trip took nearly 30 minutes.

In the end, I found that the viewing platform on the second floor of the station's north exit is the best spot to photograph Himeji Castle.

Before buying dinner, I took a stroll and played with capsule toys at the department store [Piole Himeji](https://www.jrw-urban.co.jp/piole-himeji/tw){:target="_blank"} near Himeji Station.
#### ~=20:00 Bought dinner to take back

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*piFnI5vcIs2l8lG5gQZRdg.jpeg)

I walked from the second-floor sky bridge to the adjacent TERASSO and found a still-open yakiniku restaurant to take out a grilled meat bento back to the hotel.

On the way, I also bought some snacks and drinks at a convenience store.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*1nvfzK3jA2eVr-tTRIAUBw.jpeg)

After eating and drinking, I took a shower and went downstairs to do some laundry. This time I knew that Toyoko Inn requires you to bring your own detergent, so I bought laundry powder with coins and put it along with my clothes into the washing machine; the dryer here is very new and high-end, and you can even select the temperature.

> **_Good night, Himeji._**

### Day 5 \(11/16 Saturday\) Shoshazan Engyoji Temple, Himeji Castle, and shopping around Himeji

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*EqvQAU91nnYsl8w7vT7CTg.png)

Every Toyoko Inn provides free breakfast, but I usually just grab some convenience store bread and coffee I bought the night before to eat on the go.
#### 08:45 Departed

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*HIa6B4yuh-MjFWMeBs97IQ.jpeg)

At 8:45 AM, I left the hotel and crossed the deserted shopping street towards the station.
#### 08:55 Took the bus to Shoshazan Engyoji Temple

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*3KNztIIzy_Yw85kEm5ai-Q.jpeg)

Himeji Station has several platforms, and Google Maps didn‚Äôt specify which platform or bus number to take, so I had to look for signs on-site. I took the No. 10 bus from platform 10, heading to Himeji Station North - Shoshazan Ropeway.

> _Shoshazan Engyoji Temple is a filming location for the movie The Last Samurai:_

After getting off the bus, you will find the cable car boarding area. After purchasing a round-trip ticket at the automatic ticket machine, you can line up to wait for the cable car. (Every 15 minutes)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Q96ZZxOE04V57QXJcsL2iA.jpeg)

There will be a special night opening event at Shoshazan from November 15 to 17, open until 8:00 PM, and the cable car hours will be extended to 8:30 PM.
#### 09:30 Take the cable car up the mountain

#### 09:35 Arrive at the entrance of Shoshazan Engyoji Temple

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*4AYY1gP1Kdb589JwBHaFuw.png)

You need to buy an admission ticket to enter. At that time, I didn't pay attention and only bought the **general mountain admission fee, which does not allow taking the round-trip shuttle bus; you have to walk up the mountain**. ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

Fortunately, it was early in the morning, and I was still full of energy. The gentle slope allowed me to walk and enjoy the autumn leaves on the way up.

After passing through the Nio Gate, there are about 400 meters left.
#### 09:55 Arrive at the Mani Hall

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*5nc-fnNgZHhIwlJhTcYKjg.png)

Shoshazan Engyoji Temple is vast, and I feel that it would take at least 2 hours to explore everything.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*U4wMNwdurbeaNEOqUKkC9Q.png)

I only visited the Mani Hall and the Great Lecture Hall before turning back down the mountain.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*h70I3V6EU2UIea8JaVs_jw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*IyDpkfR-0QmrIiNwGg0aJA.jpeg)

You can take off your shoes to enter the Mani Hall for worship, and you can also overlook the maple leaves from here.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*fImTadRZFNlut58qayxvhQ.jpeg)

It is very tranquil and quiet, but this year's maple leaves are a bit late, with only a few scattered trees turning red.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*mVNbxhCrjF5jWx5MXgRNWA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*mbYDfRbjjG6Z5_w8mI--EQ.jpeg)



Walk straight from the small path behind the hall to the Great Hall.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*gjTjoLDLZC6EeAP3Gcnbdw.png)


The Great Hall features an installation art piece by [Rokuharamitsu-ji x Kengo Kuma](https://x.com/kugikumo){:target="_blank"}, on display until 12/1.


![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*4m561KwGCbbgXnrrYERkJw.jpeg)


The maple leaves next to the Great Hall are very red.


> _When I arrived at the Great Hall, they were just chanting scriptures. You can also take off your shoes to enter and pay respects. The way Japanese monks chant is quite different from Taiwan; they open the entire scripture and chant it, then close it and tap it at the end._

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*NKB_Hzykps-3rC3HHrxHIg.jpeg)


The cafeteria next door is also open for visits, showcasing many historical artifacts.

All the buildings are historical sites (built in 1282), and walking on them gives a sense of traversing history. The overall architecture is well-preserved and maintained.

Looking at the Great Hall from the second floor of the cafeteria.

After visiting the Great Hall, I returned to the Mani Hall and bought a freshly baked red bean mochi from the shop outside to replenish my energy. (The freshly baked one is delicious, with a crispy skin.)


![Have a safe trip home\.](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*3vuyM_hvr2vqmMigtjrJfQ.jpeg)

Have a safe trip home\.

After eating, I took another 20 minutes to walk down the mountain back to the entrance of the shrine.
#### ~=10:55 Take the cable car down the mountain

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*mLKgafi4UWM-lqsxIxnTHg.jpeg)


At the bus stop on the way down, around 11:05, I waited for the 11:10 bus back to Himeji City.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*kxFG8jVc9-4cfH5uTVpbsQ.jpeg)


After getting off the bus, I walked a bit forward to the Himeji Castle boat tour, but since the weather was cloudy and about to rain, I didn't go.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*OwoTR1-C35HhJiv-rq8o2w.jpeg)


Entering Himeji Castle, the view of the bridge at the entrance is great for photos!

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*NISOgxwwrowWgi9jHz_qWw.jpeg)


The San-no-Maru Plaza in front of Himeji Castle is very large, and from here, it takes another 5 minutes to walk to the castle entrance.


![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*TczWjw__6r_H15vgUwkcUQ.png)


I thought I would first look for the photo spot recommended by a passerby yesterday. The photo spot is in the opposite direction from the castle entrance, inside the "Himeji City Zoo" on the right.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*GmIPAY57WWuEBRXl6tmcBw.jpeg)



Looking at the promotional materials, there is a capybara on the right side, but it might not be out due to the cold; after entering, go straight across the bridge, turn right after seeing the Ferris wheel, and there is an open space behind it which is the shooting point.


![[https://youtube\.com/shorts/XDquPOanhpQ](https://youtube.com/shorts/XDquPOanhpQ){:target="_blank"}](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Rupw705abK9nx8m8x0MPdw.jpeg)

[https://youtube\.com/shorts/XDquPOanhpQ](https://youtube.com/shorts/XDquPOanhpQ){:target="_blank"}

The view from this shooting point is great, but unfortunately, there are no cherry blossoms or maple leaves to complement it.

> _After taking photos, I wandered around this zoo. The facilities are very old (the amusement rides require additional payment), the animal spaces are small, **many look very depressed and exhibit stereotypical behaviors, which is hard to watch**, so I left after a short visit._

Once inside, you also need to take off your shoes, and a plastic bag will be provided for your shoes.

Looking back at Himeji Station from the second floor, there are a total of six floors, getting smaller as you go up, and the stairs become steeper, requiring a queue to go upstairs.


> _At this point, it was close to 12:30 PM, feeling very hungry and having forgotten to bring a power bank today, my phone was almost out of battery, and with the long queue, I decided not to continue climbing and turned back at the second floor._

[Kushiyaki Kobe beef](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3ANcmi6uR1wnDgqYA){:target="_blank"}

I found a shop selling Kobe beef in the shopping street outside Himeji Castle and took out a Kobe beef rice bowl and skewers to rest and recharge at the hotel.
#### 13:20 Back to the hotel to rest

Poor weather + hiking in the morning + phone out of battery = back to the hotel to rest.

Aside from the portion being a bit small, the Kobe beef at this place tastes quite good.
#### 15:30 Shopping near Himeji Station

After resting until around 15:30, I headed out again.

Surprisingly, there isn't much to shop around Himeji Station. There's only the Piole near the station and the department store in the SANYO building, along with a shopping street nearby. There are no Don Quijote, McDonald's, and only one Lawson and one Matsumoto Kiyoshi pharmacy.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*H_cAfQPJP8QXU_7MPgzYyA.jpeg)

On the third floor of Piole, Kiddy Land has some cute figures. There weren't many people here, so there was no need to queue. I brought home three little ones, but I couldn't find the sleepwear version of Usachii QQ.

I randomly found a restaurant with Kobe beef in the shopping street for dinner.

This place features a fortune cat dessert as an appetizer, which isn't too sweet and quite nice.

I ordered Kobe steak, chazuke, and a draft beer.

I found the Kobe steak here to be average, not very tender, and I couldn't really taste the Kobe beef flavor. However, the chazuke was quite delicious.

After eating, I wandered around a bit more in Himeji after the rain.
#### ~=20:00 Return to the hotel to rest & watch the Japan-Taiwan game

From a Japanese perspective, the broadcast content is completely incomprehensible, but the information provided is very comprehensive. On the left, there are supplementary baseball knowledge notes, and on the right, there is a complete analysis of the pitches.

In the end, Japan won this match.

### Day 6 \(11/17 Sunday\) Osaka, Kobe

I originally wanted to rush to Naruto Whirlpools and the Akashi Kaiky≈ç Bridge, but the weather was still poor, so I decided to go shopping in Osaka and Kobe instead.

Taking the Shinkansen to Shin-Osaka (25 minutes) and then transferring to the Midosuji Line to Osaka takes about the same time as taking a regular train directly to Osaka. The Shinkansen has many departures, so I chose to take the more comfortable option that also allows for charging.
#### 9:17 Arrive at Shin-Osaka

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*6ptZt3XbRNnIK1Ph62j9eg.jpeg)

After arriving at Shin-Osaka, I still had to walk a bit to the Midosuji Line.

First, I went to the Namba Yasaka Shrine, which I missed during my last visit to the Kansai region.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*uCKGMuqTmPVL61gvJU_AKg.jpeg)

After getting off at Namba Station, I walked a short distance into a certain alley to find the shrine.

> _I just realized that Osaka is also testing facial recognition for entering and exiting stations._

#### ~=9:50 Arrive at Namba Yasaka Shrine

The shrine is not large, and there are many tourists. I took a few photos and then left.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*1YnEjMoc8KV-OaV08XrMcA.jpeg)

After leaving, I continued walking to the next stop, "Daikokucho," and took one stop to "Dobutsuen-mae" to head to Tsutenkaku.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*bxBxGhqonhPE-kNU7jl5DA.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*_ZGMWno1bnS5VIsevjVuGw.jpeg)

After exiting the station, I crossed the underground passage and shopping street, and continued walking forward to see the Tsutenkaku Tower.

> _It feels quite chaotic here; as soon as I exited the station and crossed the underground passage, there were many homeless people, and some were arguing loudly, which was a bit scary._

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*WOzCL0xA6hirl6Ru3iYxlg.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*xWz0KkdvI5042L31ritmjw.png)

The shopping street is narrow with food on both sides, and there are a few places that seem to be popular with long lines of people.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*GiVI9kQjjJLKp5E0BYq__Q.png)

Around 10:30, I arrived at the base of Tsutenkaku, where there was a long line of people waiting to go up, so I decided to give up.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*oRVH7x_G3Ga19FD04YQCIg.jpeg)

I walked back to the subway station to return to Osaka.

After exiting the station, head to LINKS department store; the fifth floor provides direct access to the Yodobashi capsule toy area.

On the 13th floor, you'll find the Pok√©mon Center, Osaka Nintendo, CAPCOM, and more.


![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*EJivBHlcWiG1tgWQoVQWQQ.jpeg)


I took a quick look at the Zelda merchandise; [I already bought a lot last time](../76d66c2e34af/), so I left without purchasing anything this time.

Passed by the Hanshin Tigers merchandise store.

I was preparing to eat at Shake Shack; I had it in Bangkok in July and [still crave it](https://medium.com/ztravel/%E9%81%8A%E8%A8%98-2024-%E6%B3%B0%E5%9C%8B%E6%9B%BC%E8%B0%B7-bangkok-5-%E6%97%A5%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E8%A1%8C-b7e7c0938985?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------){:target="_blank"} ; now I'm back in Osaka to relive the experience.

I ordered directly at the self-service kiosk; this time I had the avocado bacon chicken burger and a milkshake. This location is quite spacious with plenty of seating.

After eating, I strolled around the Osaka Station area, thinking of visiting Kiddy Land in Osaka to look for Gigi Kawaii.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*qyNQwZ0U6ZWvoyVpBq69yA.jpeg)


I got lost in the underground shopping area of Osaka, and after walking for a long time, I finally found Hankyu Sanbangai. Then I walked through the underground passage from the South Building to the North Building, and I was right at the food street.

There are quite a few people in line, estimated to wait at least 40 minutes or more.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*ipoT-8QkWmfXhInjaK3Q2w.jpeg)

There seem to be more events, possibly due to the holiday; outside Kiddy Land, there is also a photo opportunity with Kanaheala. (Another Usagi XD)
#### 13:20 Head to Kobe

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*iuobD0lpLgt6UCJ8Wqk3ag.png)

I got lost again in the underground shopping area before finding the Osaka Umeda subway station, taking the Hankyu Kobe Line to Sannomiya, Kobe (Hankyu).
#### 13:50 Arrive in Kobe

It's still early, so I plan to go to the "[Kobe Animal Kingdom](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fspZDr7MyGMpT24r6){:target="_blank"}" to find capybaras.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*L_861E8BgHXpjDqG7B-ExA.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*wkKdFGjiN_C6aGWTNSNxXA.jpeg)

Google Maps directed me to take the "New Transportation Port Island Line," and I wandered around the underground shopping area for a long time without finding the corresponding signs. (Lost Day)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*OAOZe3cdGLU6r_6Nv2QEww.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Rx_UFhPm-pM6Nxn2DTKx6w.jpeg)

I only realized after exiting that it was the line running above, entering from the second floor of Sannomiya Station.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*yWTsJjuy_Xn01e9Lus8YOw.png)

The station was crowded, and later I found out that today happened to be the [Kobe Marathon](https://zh-tw.kobe-marathon.net/2024/global/){:target="_blank"}.

Lost Day‚Ä¶ because the train happened to arrive, I didn't pay close attention and got on the wrong train heading to Kitakube, and the tragedy began from that moment.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*sURfSLVO2IkE2QPTq3zm7g.png)

> **_To get to the Kobe Animal Kingdom, you need to take the train to Kobe Airport; the one to Kitakube will turn back at Kitakube and return to Kobe._** _‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è_

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*z8eEqxV_DQKM1FGLRxRU7A.png)

The Kobe Marathon has closed roads running on elevated roads; this subway line is similar to the early tire metro of the Taipei MRT Wenhu Line.
#### 14:20 Realized I took the wrong train and got off at Nakakube

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*IGsTOnGQ2wiFBthumdIybw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*_BOkMH5_0AnTJcaZCtwUtg.jpeg)

I got off here because it felt wrong, and Google Maps suggested I walk back to Civic Square Station to catch the next train.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*wCBuXOfGc6fSMVTM1MLZ_w.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*g8uGboUzgjpperWLcaCe-A.jpeg)

Perhaps because this is a newly reclaimed port area, it feels very desolate and the walk seems long.
```

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*ZyXQTkEYvXAbIv0TVUgCzQ.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*5ZyBkEGQ_NiYON5ofd9faw.png)

Walking quickly to the Civic Square front station, I wondered why it was so lively; it turned out to be the venue for the Kobe Marathon's finish line activities.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*ULve9yF_dxl_KN_wjREO0g.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*YGSebYSQT5maJTHBLgu2xA.jpeg)

> _Tragedy 2: Because there were too many people, this station was not allowing entry, so I had to walk further to the South Park station._

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*2Gq2LpscnF2cQqBST6ueyA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*gW7yF6pDt4RDQIzLnd-f0A.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*HoUGLVRBxl2s45E40BMLGQ.jpeg)

After reaching South Park station, it was just one more stop, but I was too lazy to take the subway and walked directly to the Kobe Animal Kingdom...

As mentioned earlier, it felt quite far due to the desolation, and it indeed was far; it was a 2-kilometer walk (about 30 minutes) from Minato-Motomachi.

#### 14:50 Arrived at Kobe Animal Kingdom

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*HzgFgMtmQ3Sw6piVC4Mblg.png)

Ticket price: 2,200 yen

Spoon-billed Sandpiper, Rabbit, Red Panda

Although the Kobe Animal Kingdom is semi-indoor and semi-outdoor, the layout inside is quite good, featuring various birds and animals, most of which can be closely interacted with. It is very suitable for families to spend half a day here; the condition of the animals is much better compared to the Himeji City Zoo, and the environment is very clean.

#### Capybara

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*DK2DEH8iPJmiTyDHldeqHQ.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*XtvMffuoulVGOt0AK88BbQ.jpeg)

The purpose of coming here was achieved: to touch the capybara. They are so fat, and their fur feels rough, like a broom.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*AoazZpBcYuh-LpiZLCk6fw.jpeg)

Each one looks so lazy; it must be nice not to have to work!

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Dui-4l3rOZkGVjVuEAjqZw.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*a0JZ_DEQph3dAI-Mlzhxvw.jpeg)

Perhaps because they are too fat, they are currently not selling food for feeding inside the venue, and outside food or placing items on their heads is not allowed.

In another area, there are kangaroos and sheep for close interaction.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*D4K3htSuQ7vwCDGqizRLrg.jpeg)

Remember to wash your hands before and after touching.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*A540bEA8Z1WvYv2BZZB6XQ.jpeg)

There is also a seal, but it seems the space is too small, and it keeps going in circles QQ

There is also an interactive area for rabbits, cats, and dogs indoors (you need to get a ticket), along with food and a souvenir shop‚Ä¶ etc.

Overall, the experience was quite good!
#### 15:50 Departing, preparing to return to Kobe

The main purpose was to pet the capybaras, and since there wasn't much time, I didn't stay too long.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*yfpUfEWTujRfFn1SLBi8aQ.jpeg)

#### ~= 16:05 Arrived at \(Kobe\) Sannomiya Station

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*oNUQVDNJXP_zpuS0vPWIWA.png)

Due to the Kobe Marathon, there were many people exiting the station.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*4kvY1I-JyKoMbo6Xo3Mg6A.png)

There is still over an hour until meal time, so I decided to stroll around Sannomiya in Kobe, looking for capsule toys and Kiddy Land.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*LAu0vz0PiOzK3QC8xQbeJg.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*eDM9G1Lrm5nQLnusWKD7uA.jpeg)

Kiddy Land in Kobe wasn't very crowded, but there were very few Gigi Kawaii products, and I couldn't find the pajamas I wanted featuring Usagi.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Cmt7wQ4UV4cYAaTNzxvgHA.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*q7C947BYHvNxBDhPSGG6uQ.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*WlCIdUIpqTHUN4jwg1x_Hg.png)

I went to the second floor to look for capsule toys and also checked out the second-hand store to see if they had the Usagi I wanted.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*AF8Ium09DuuXVdb6wgirtQ.jpeg)

On B1, there is a Kobe Beef Yoshikichi, and I came here for dinner around five o'clock.

It was still early, and there weren't many people; the owner was very enthusiastic when he heard I was from Taiwan. This meal was also one of the purposes of coming to Kobe, **to have a good meal ‚Äî Kobe beef**, otherwise, I had been eating randomly for the past few days.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*TplkGy7shiHlWAHyLf9-KQ.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*0ufGhslTqU6l0UUlsFCOCg.png)

I ordered the "Kobe Beef Lean Steak 220g" for 7,700 yen (pre-tax‚ö†Ô∏è, the bill will include tax) along with a set (salad, rice, soup) and a draft beer.

The lettuce is refreshing, and the soup is beef broth, which is very delicious.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*MUe5xLDpu4wLU2OCnrddTw.jpeg)

The meat is very tender, juicy, and flavorful. Compared to the Kobe beef I had yesterday, this is the true taste of Kobe beef.

> _However, I must say I still prefer teppanyaki, which surpasses Western cuisine._

The final bill: `$2,158 TWD`.
#### 17:40 Finished eating and left for Kobe Tower

After eating, I walked to the old settlement along the coastline, got off at Daimaru-mae Station, and then walked to Kobe Tower.

Kobe is quite lively here (compared to Himeji), with many department stores to explore.

I took the train to Shin-Nagata and got off at the next stop, Kouen-machi.
#### 18:05 Arrived near Kobe Tower

Kobe Port has a charming harbor town feel, and if given the chance, I would consider staying a night in Kobe.

This time, I just took a quick look around and left.
#### 18:30 Back to Kobe Chinatown

On the way back to Kobe Station, I stopped by Chinatown to buy [Kobe Frantz chocolate souvenirs](https://frantz.co.jp/en/){:target="_blank"}.

#### 09:13 Arriving at Okayama Station

The Shinkansen takes about 21 minutes to reach Okayama Station, but unfortunately, there isn't enough time to [visit Hiroshima again](https://medium.com/ztravel/%E9%81%8A%E8%A8%98-2023-%E5%BB%A3%E5%B3%B6%E5%B2%A1%E5%B1%B1-6-%E6%97%A5%E9%81%8A-31b9b3a63abc?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------){:target="_blank"}.


![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*PgFJG7RNh8w5f4pK5Dv6Eg.jpeg)


As before, heading directly to the west exit of Okayama Station to catch the bus to the airport, where there are lockers for luggage storage and restrooms \(the department store isn't open yet, so there are few restrooms at this time\).
#### 09:30 Eating the popular "McGriddle" from McDonald's at Okayama Station


![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*1O8uNrClegWyQoAJE12e5g.png)


I almost chose the wrong item because I couldn't read Japanese; I needed to select this "„Éû„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Ç∞„É™„Éâ„É´" for the pancake series.


> _McDonald's breakfast in Japan is available until 10:30._

After eating, around 10:00, there weren't any specific places I wanted to go.

[I've already visited Okayama Castle and Kibitsu Shrine last time](../31b9b3a63abc/), so I decided to stroll around Okayama AEON Mall.

For food and souvenirs (B1-B2), there are also plenty of options.

[**Pork Steak Specialty Store B Okayama Branch**](https://tabelog.com/okayama/A3301/A330101/33018608/){:target="_blank"}

I chose a restaurant that specializes in teppanyaki pork chops.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*f9-cymGYzbWqmSgVSwht8Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*-8Sx-7tZ5l-DPua6GOunTA.jpeg)

I ordered a teppanyaki pork chop set meal (200g) and a draft beer. The total was `2,178 yen`.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*rT1vHotHA_BsYMp5BFadUQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*weW08CNKF-sFY48mz-Qw7g.jpeg)

What surprised me was that the pork chop was not fully cooked when it arrived, about 70% done; after checking reviews and introductions, it seems this is the restaurant's specialty. However, I still cooked the meat pieces that could be cooked while the teppan was hot.

> _It really tasted good, very juicy, with a strong meaty flavor, and it was tender; I personally think it rivals yesterday's Kobe beef (I might not have the fortune for luxury)._

A small suitcase (about the same size as AirPods Pro) and a baby bag.

Finally, I bought some items at Muji on the first floor and left around 12:15.
#### ~=12:30 Returned to Okayama Station

I prepared to take the 13:00 shuttle to Okayama Airport.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*YD-OAt75d1s69u6qZpWrsw.png)


I queued at platform 21 to wait for the bus. No need to worry about missing it; anyone who queues before 13:00 will be taken to the airport (if full, additional shuttles will be added).

You can directly swipe your transportation card (Suica) to get on and off, or go to the waiting area to buy a ticket with coins.


![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*wZz-iSrK6orko9_30h31gw.jpeg)



![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*2Ey3Ma7iGU0aZcvM-5-KuA.jpeg)


Due to being full, it departed early at 12:45.
#### ~=13:20 Arrived at Okayama Momotaro Airport


![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*7gnnl4V4uwpVHg9wq9sliw.jpeg)



![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Zev8bJycwEj6HruuaPqWyA.jpeg)


It was still very early. This year, I took the flight departing at 17:30; last year, I came at 15:25, which was just right. Arriving now for the 17:30 flight means waiting almost 4 hours.


![[https://www\.okayama\-airport\.org/tw/access/bus](https://www.okayama-airport.org/tw/access/bus){:target="_blank"}](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*EL5tuKai1e95lToFw7agNQ.png)

[https://www\.okayama\-airport\.org/tw/access/bus](https://www.okayama-airport.org/tw/access/bus){:target="_blank"}


> _But currently, there's no other option because **the next bus is at 15:55, arriving at the airport at 16:25**; although the airport is small and there‚Äôs only one flight departing at the same time, it‚Äôs hard to guarantee arriving by 16:25 due to potential traffic. When I came, I encountered traffic that added almost 30 minutes to the journey._ 





> _We‚Äôll see if Okayama Airport will increase the number of shuttle buses later, or if I can find someone in the [**Japan Free Travel Discussion Group**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/207266832755595){:target="_blank"} to share a taxi._ 





> _I‚Äôve seen others share that a taxi from Okayama Station to the airport costs around 7,000 yen._

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*JZnvFBhhDjBVHdeEqPDYHw.jpeg)


There are quite a few seats to rest in the domestic terminal.

On the first floor, there‚Äôs only one souvenir shop and nothing else. [Just like last year](../31b9b3a63abc/), I bought a peach mochi to eat.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*PQ1GM0STjbTPYN0p6_S_aA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*1vlNWZvaNY8I47Qydyd9cw.jpeg)

The second floor is under renovation, and only a few shops are open. The [viewing platform that was accessible last year](../31b9b3a63abc/) seems to be closed as well; however, there is still a souvenir shop and a few places to eat.

#### ~=15:00 Check-in begins

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*lGDYdJexHQY6XkiyPZJOhw.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*1oLSBw-IwqMJh4-RA81Apg.png)

Takamatsu Airport is quite small, and the check-in and baggage drop process is different from other airports.

> **_Here, you line up uniformly. For checked baggage, it goes through X-ray + a seal sticker will be applied. If you don't have checked baggage, you can skip this (the security check before departure will scan other items). Even those without checked baggage need to line up_** _; when it's your turn, just tell the airport staff that you don't have checked baggage and go through. If you open your suitcase after the sticker is applied, it will need to be rescanned + re-stickered. ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è_

> _The airport staff can speak Chinese... very impressive._

#### ~=15:15 Check-in + baggage drop completed

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*k2WrB1ooYpRa8zSD8A2Dlw.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*MNH21H-7oPaOq-GP_uKUpA.png)

I didn't buy much this time; without any alcohol, my luggage is already 17 kg... but I hardly have any carry-on luggage, as everything is packed inside.

#### ~=16:20 Start queueing for security check and departure

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Wjgk2cV8hkiBkIjxjke6AA.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*iezQ2KMlAUzJrKjqlHzyLw.jpeg)

The airport is under renovation... but there are still capsule toys.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*di7LhsC-MYyRIVwYRWVU-Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*AHTIPdSzU7TJrq1hVeKACg.png)

Although there is only one flight, due to the small size of the airport, fewer staff, only one line, and thorough checks, the security check for departure took about 20‚Äì30 minutes.

The area for pouring water and discarding items is just a box.

> _It feels like if you catch the 15:55 bus from Okayama, arriving at the airport at 16:25, if you can arrive on time, the check-in and baggage drop area would be empty, and you could proceed directly. Then, you could go straight to the security check for departure, which should be manageable._

> _There is only our flight, so it seems they will wait until all checked-in passengers have completed security before taking off. Arriving early at the airport does not mean you will get through security faster._

#### ~=16:42 Start waiting for the flight

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*dZLP9y156IaL2ZYxefWyAQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*0-fhLcrfopTMrx9rvE0nYg.png)

The waiting room is not large, with only one duty-free shop that sells some souvenirs and a limited selection of tobacco and alcohol products.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*SAM-saIjWrap5wL4dAxENQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*QCxhYYWHW2RLvZsTgWQ0Sw.jpeg)

I wanted to buy a few cans of peach soda to take back to Taiwan, but they were all sold out; I ended up getting a can of H≈çjicha instead. After returning, I found it very delicious and not too sweet, regretting not buying a few more cans.

#### ~=18:10 Takeoff (delayed by 40 minutes)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*f3Yqp6letQnKZI8spjNn-Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*PSlGa7hB3SwG6zFHnEVFLQ.jpeg)

> **_Goodbye Okayama, goodbye Japan._**

I sat next to a YouTuber on the plane, " [**Chill with us**](https://www.youtube.com/@lw.chill2022){:target="_blank"}," who was very nice. He was going to Shikoku this time, and we exchanged recommendations for attractions. I hope to visit Shikoku someday.

#### 19:45 Arrived in Taiwan (delayed by 10 minutes)


Fortunately, it only affected me for 10 minutes, and I quickly picked up my luggage and rushed to the bus station.
#### 20:20 Departure to Taipei on the Da-Yo Bus


![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*EDhpsb6FiVOOwKoDslj3nA.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*uRb-Shzk65f1cuiiBxd6SQ.jpeg)


Depending on the location, you can take different buses home. Previously, I took the Kuo-Kuang Bus directly back to Taipei, but this time I will take the Da-Yo Bus from platform 11 back to New Taipei.


> _Coincidentally, my EasyCard balance was insufficient to swipe, so I rushed to the counter to buy a ticket with cash (thankfully, I had some New Taiwan Dollars on me the day before), and I ultimately managed to catch the bus._ 




#### Journey Conclusion.
### Summary of Insights

This trip was too tightly scheduled, and I rushed through many places, especially the first three days, where the travel distance was longer and the stopover time was too short. I didn't get to fully enjoy the beautiful scenery of Shimane and Izumo; if I have the chance, I would like to go again to watch the sunset, see the autumn leaves, and experience the Shinto rituals during the festivals.

If you want to learn about history, you can refer to Lan Dad's videos when visiting Izumo:
