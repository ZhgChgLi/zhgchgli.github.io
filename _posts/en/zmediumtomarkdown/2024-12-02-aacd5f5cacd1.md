### [Travelogue] 2024 San'in Wide Area: Shimane, Izumo, Matsue, Tottori, Himeji, Osaka, Kobe 7-Day Solo Trip

Starting from Okayama, first visit San'in region: Shimane Prefecture including Izumo and Matsue, then go to Tottori, and finally return to Himeji, Kansai, and Osaka; 7 days, 100,000 steps, covering over 1,000 kilometers of travel, exploring the San'in and Kansai areas in one trip.

Sunset at Lake Shinji

#### Preface

At the very beginning, I planned to go to Sendai in the second half of 2024. However, after checking the attractions, I found my interest was just average at that time. Thinking back to the same week last year, from 11/13 to 11/18, I went on a **"[Sanyo Area Hiroshima Okayama 6-Day Free Trip](../31b9b3a63abc/)"** and had a great impression of the Chugoku region, Sanyo, and Okayama — beautiful scenery, convenient transportation, and fewer tourists. So, I decided to explore the San'in region (Shimane, Tottori) this time. Fortunately, I also had a break from work and needed to clear my mind, which led to this 7-day 6-night solo trip to the San'in area (plus Kansai region: Himeji, Osaka).

### Preparation Work

#### Date: 11/12–18

This time, it was another spontaneous trip. In mid-October, I suddenly found a free slot and immediately planned to depart on 11/12 and return on 11/18.

#### ✈️ Flight Tickets

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*XRfz2GcB_EiuvwxLYIFCTw.png)

This year, I didn't specifically rush to buy Tigerair's autumn sale tickets. **Last year, I got discounted tickets** with better timing and lower prices ( `Last year: Departure (11:10), Return (15:25), including 20KG checked baggage each way + seat selection + fees: NT$ 7,012` ).

- Departure: 13:05 TPE Taipei Taoyuan International Airport -> **16:30 OKJ** Okayama Momotaro Airport

- Return: **17:30 OKJ** Okayama Momotaro Airport -> 19:35 TPE Taipei Taoyuan International Airport

- Including round-trip 20KG checked baggage + seat selection + miscellaneous fees: `NT$ 9,118`

Not particularly cheap, but still acceptable. If you choose the same departure and return dates as last year, it will be more expensive, around `NT$ 12,000`.

#### Tigerair 2025 New Direct Flight Routes

[Tigerair Taiwan will add a direct flight from Taoyuan International Airport to Tottori Yonago Airport starting Thursday, May 29, 2025, making it easier to visit the San'in region!](https://chugoku.letsgojp.com/archives/731900){:target="_blank"}

#### 🏝️Plan

I haven't been to the San'in region or Himeji, so I will focus on these three places.

- 11/12 Arrive in Okayama in the evening and stay overnight to prepare for the trip to Shimane the next morning

- On the morning of 11/13, take the JR train to Shimane. First, visit Izumo Taisha and Inasa Beach. In the afternoon and evening, go to Lake Shinji to watch the sunset.

- 11/14 Morning: Matsue Castle and Matsue Horikawa Boat Tour, Afternoon: Adachi Museum of Art, Evening: Arrive in Tottori

- 11/15 Morning: Shirahige Shrine, Afternoon: Tottori Sand Dunes, Evening: Arrive at Himeji

- 11/16 Himeji Castle, Shopping in Himeji City  
  Actually visited more: Shosha Mountain Engyo-ji Temple

- 11/17 Onaruto Bridge Promenade Uzunomichi, Naruto Whirlpools, Akashi Kaikyō Bridge  
  Due to bad weather, we didn't go and instead went shopping and eating in Osaka and Kobe.

- 11/18 Shopping at Okayama Station, Return Trip

#### 🚅 Travel - [**Japan JR PASS｜Kansai & Sanin Area Rail Pass｜eMCO e-Ticket**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20307-jr-sanin-okayama-area-pass?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}

This time, it’s also a long-distance trip, so the JR Pass is a must. I initially worried there would only be the San'in and Sanyo JR Passes, but Japan JR thoughtfully planned all possible routes. The "[**Kansai & San'in Area Rail Pass JRPass**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20307-jr-sanin-okayama-area-pass?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}" fits my needs perfectly!

[Kansai & Sanin Area Rail Pass JRPass Coverage](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20307-jr-sanin-okayama-area-pass?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}

- Price: `NT$ 3,779` Includes an extra [**Sanin-Sanyo Area PASS 3-Day Ticket (great value when used together)**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20307-jr-sanin-okayama-area-pass?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}

#### 📱Internet

This time, I also purchased from KKday the "[**Japan eSIM Card｜Daily High-Speed, Total, Unlimited Data Plan｜65% Off**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137689-japan-high-speed-daily-unlimited-data-japanese-esim?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}"

- 7-Day Unlimited Data eSIM Plan

- Price: `NT$ 847`

In actual use, it works very well, is stable, and I haven't encountered any throttling or disconnection issues.

> *The eSIM activation method and precautions will be included in the article. Please continue reading.*

#### Japanese Yen

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*ljW0bI5fjkI2Xasi4KvA5A.jpeg)

Exchanged for new Japanese yen bills.

> *It is recommended to bring both new and old bills, as some vending machines do not accept new bills.*

#### 🏠 Accommodation

This time, I was lucky to only miss booking [Toyoko Inn](https://www.toyoko-inn.com/china/index2){:target="_blank"} for one night in Matsue; all other nights were booked.

**11/12 [Toyoko INN Okayama Station East Exit](https://www.toyoko-inn.com/china/search/detail/00232/){:target="_blank"} (One night)**

![It takes 4 minutes to walk from Dekoyama Station](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Kidzn6hm372657rCN8jTgw.png)

It takes 4 minutes to walk from Okayama Station.

- Non-smoking twin room, occupancy: 1 person

- Price: `NT$ 1,616`

**11/13 [Matsue Urban Hotel](https://www.station.matsue-urban.co.jp/en/){:target="_blank"} (One night)**

![Exit Songjiang Station and walk 2 minutes to arrive](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*9QIJ7lY1W7L94dgKGm6VQQ.png)

Exit Songjiang Station and walk for 2 minutes to arrive.

- Double Room with Small Double Bed — Non-Smoking — Building 2  
  Occupancy: 1 person

- Price: `NT$ 2,431`

**11/14 [Toyoko INN Tottori Station South Exit](https://www.toyoko-inn.com/china/search/detail/00046/){:target="_blank"} (One night)**

![4-minute walk from Tottori Station exit](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*hIqnM7MaRDWsRoRsydTqCg.png)

It takes a 4-minute walk from Tottori Station exit.

- Non-smoking double room, occupancy: 1 person

- Price: `NT$ 1,595`

**11/15 [Toyoko INN Himeji Station Shinkansen North Exit](https://www.toyoko-inn.com/china/search/detail/00317/){:target="_blank"} (three nights)**

![Exit Himeji Station and walk 5 minutes to arrive](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*P4xut5p60ZVSDtPkpoO6Pw.png)

It takes a 5-minute walk from Himeji Station exit.

- Non-smoking double room, occupancy: 1 person

- Price: `NT$ 6,055`, `NT$ 2,018` / night

Although we managed to book Toyoko almost every time, the late booking meant only double rooms were left, so the price per night was higher. If we had booked a single room, the price could have been kept under NT$1,500 per night. However, based on past experience, even double rooms get fully booked as the date approaches, possibly because the location is less popular?

> *The room unboxing video will be included in the article, please continue reading.*

#### Tigerair Online Self Check-in

You will receive a trip notification email from Tigerair 1 to 3 days before departure. **Be sure! Be sure! Be sure!** to complete the online "self check-in" before departure:

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*3K4biik6RnLXrqp453siiA.png)

After clicking self check-in, you will be directed to the Tigerair website to confirm passenger information and baggage security. Finally, a boarding pass will be generated and sent.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*oupKW1tFwXdEwj4pEAL8hw.png)

Keep your boarding pass safe. With it, you can go directly to the airport's "Self-Service Baggage Check-in" to drop off your luggage, avoiding long lines at the regular check-in counters.

### Day 1 (11/12 Tuesday) Departure

The flight is at 1:05 PM. Woke up at 8 AM and left around 9 AM, plenty of time to spare.

![[2024/11 Screenshot from the Online Check-in Official Website](https://www.taoyuan-airport.com/ITCI/index.html){:target="_blank"}](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*LyhBB17WajIUYryRUrIgaA.png)

[2024/11 Extracted from the Online Check-in Official Website](https://www.taoyuan-airport.com/ITCI/index.html){:target="_blank"}

Tigerair [**Online Check-in Service (Check in and drop luggage at the Airport MRT, then go straight to departure at the airport)**](https://www.taoyuan-airport.com/ITCI/index.html){:target="_blank"} is only available at **Airport MRT A3 New Taipei Industrial Park Station**; not at Taipei Main Station, so I took the direct Airport MRT train straight to Terminal 1.

#### ~= 10:00 Arrive at the airport

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*4_ZTToEL1W6fwNWpo_GvBw.jpeg)

Arrived at the airport around 10:00, but the counter opens only at 10:20.

#### ~= 10:20 Queue for "Self-Service Baggage Check-in" to drop off luggage

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*4y0Kgdbk8bbcUgajmi27IQ.png)

![Departure: 9 KG](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*5_TKj5PZ-iUMi3r3CqrmzA.png)

Outbound: 9 KG

At this point, the advantage of using online check-in on the Tigerair website becomes clear. On the day, the regular check-in counters were already crowded by 10:20, with long lines estimated to take at least 45 minutes to an hour. The self-service baggage drop, however, took less than 15 minutes to complete, saving a lot of waiting time.

> *Completing online check-in on-site and then lining up for "self-service baggage drop" is much faster than queuing for "regular check-in."*

#### ~= 10:50 Completed exit procedures

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*aD3atJOMZWAhStzpdoaZDg.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*OLORgiz8R6pOfG-m9P-aOw.jpeg)

This time at Terminal 1, Gate A1. (Finally, no more shuttle buses needed)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*MDpHGgVgU0QRH0BGFmzLbA.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*ZU4N6uWzEYhp_J2C3JE0Dg.png)

Every time I came to Terminal 1 before, I always ate at Ding Gua Gua. This time, I switched to Lao Dong Beef Noodles, which is conveniently located near Gate A1.

#### ~= 11:30 Waiting at the gate

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Xaux1WjOTpXcqxeF1-UlXw.jpeg)

After eating, I wandered around until about 11:30. The downside of Gate A1 is that it is far from the [**Terminal 1 Free Lounge**](../cb65fd5ab770/). Too lazy to walk back and forth, I went straight to the waiting area.

Before handling two network issues, the first is that my [**Chunghwa Telecom roaming function is turned off**](https://123.cht.com.tw/IVRredir/){:target="_blank"}, so I cannot directly purchase a roaming plan if needed; therefore, I first called Chunghwa Telecom to unlock the roaming function as a precaution.

![You need to call Chunghwa Telecom and confirm your personal information with customer service to unlock the account.](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*dF9XuqFK3bW2X249DYtqZg.png)

You need to call Chunghwa Telecom, verify your personal information, and ask the customer service to unlock the account.

#### Enable eSIM in Advance (Using iPhone as an Example)

The second network issue is activating the eSIM at the airport first. Since activating the eSIM requires an internet connection, and the WiFi at Okayama Airport might be unstable, the Japanese eSIM was activated in advance while the internet in Taiwan was stable.

> *If you are still worried about internet issues causing entry problems, **you can also take a screenshot of the entry QR Code** or fill out a paper entry card simultaneously for double protection.*

Previously, the eSIM bought in [Thailand could be added automatically by long-pressing the QR Code in the purchase confirmation email, PDF, or screenshot and tapping "Add eSIM"](../b7e7c0938985/), but this time the Japan eSIM did not show that option:

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*su5YVQrLdjFXORHuiMZxuw.png)

**Found a method provided by a [user](https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/iOS/M.1719797706.A.916.html){:target="_blank"} that can successfully show the "Add eSIM" option. (Seems to be an iOS bug, broken after iOS 17.4):**

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*DrYXYUfGj_BddPe8FwbM4A.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Z-Ls2JPUbJAw93L7ey91gw.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*BwNRm45uuwJcWjnYicDIEA.png)

1. Go to the eSIM certificate email or PDF, take a screenshot on your phone, and save the screenshot to your photo album.

2. Open the phone camera and tap the bottom left corner to enter the album.

3. Find the eSIM photo in the album, long press the QR code to see the "Add eSIM" option.

4. Click "Add eSIM" to directly input activation information and activate the eSIM

#### Manually Enable eSIM on iPhone

**Go to "Settings" -> "Cellular" -> "Add eSIM" -> "Use QR Code":**

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*TUIEbNDhczwvTehfFza_sg.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*7hYiMadhEnU5NOt58ashJw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*YUjZUpfB6BeLQKNWTMx-5A.png)

I printed out the eSIM QR code, so I activated it by scanning directly from there.

If you have nothing, you can click "Manually Enter Details" to copy and paste the eSIM certificate information for manual activation:

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*TdmMDosao98OATMJNa0NLw.png)

Fill in the email content with `SM-DP+ Address`, `Activation Code`, and `Confirmation Code` (none this time), then click Next to complete activation.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*cXjnkvYvDGnE-ByT3hcnaw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*sc6xr-nA3J_BdYMcNBNMFA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Rh7hWbEiUtLbR3VYXq9NOw.png)

After inputting, it takes some time to activate. It may get stuck on "Activating..." for a while or show an activation failure message like "Try again later." Just wait a bit longer. Once activated, "Settings" -> "Cellular" will show "On," and the signal icon in the top right will display signal bars below it.

- The action plan tag can be set to "Travel"

> ***We are still in Taiwan and cannot connect to the eSIM Japan network yet. Just make sure the activation is successful.***

#### ~= 12:20 Boarding begins, no delay

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*R1I1UY831lnjto_6jqwCFw.jpeg)

#### ~= 13:05 On-time Departure

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*ovXkaMS4yzLWpm2_YBTPFw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*IQ1kIFLjFgrYHUqulJMO7Q.jpeg)

At this time, heavy rain began in Taiwan, but there was little wind, so it did not significantly affect the takeoff.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Ooxdur72IKkRc4u5q52esQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*ECU47qVPUd7cv6UcBy6i3Q.jpeg)

I find Tigerair's seat comfort to be excellent among low-cost carriers (compared to Peach's seats being too small and VietJet's seats being uncomfortable). However, a downside of Tigerair is the [**ban on bringing your own food**](https://www.threads.net/@kechi.syonen/post/DCYnEQNzU5L/%E4%BB%80%E9%BA%BC%E8%83%BD%E5%B8%B6%E4%B8%8A%E9%A3%9B%E6%A9%9F%E4%BB%80%E9%BA%BC%E4%B8%8D%E8%83%BD%E5%B8%B6%E5%BE%88%E6%B8%85%E6%A5%9A%E4%BB%99%E5%8F%B0%E6%A9%9F%E5%A0%B4){:target="_blank"}, so make sure you’re not hungry before the flight!

No WiFi on the plane, can only listen to music and play offline games.

You can see from the window that the weather in Japan is very nice. 👍👍👍

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*y36b_kkD7RMz1R501bPkIw.png)

After landing in Japan, our Japan eSIM should be able to receive a signal.

> *Signal is available but you still can't access the internet. Go to "Settings" -> "Cellular" -> select **Travel Japan eSIM** -> make sure "Enable this line" is on and **turn on "Data Roaming" to get internet access! ⚠️⚠️⚠️***

> *You can also enter the **main Chunghwa Telecom** number. If you haven't purchased Chunghwa Telecom's roaming plan, remember to **turn off "Data Roaming" here, but keep "Enable this number" on to continue receiving SMS from Taiwan!***

> ***Please note: Do not answer calls randomly, receiving domestic calls abroad will also incur charges! ⚠️⚠️⚠️ (Only receiving text messages is free)***

#### ~= 17:00 Complete immigration and collect luggage

- Okayama Momotaro Airport is a very small airport, with only one international flight at a time (which is your flight). You go through immigration and pick up your luggage together with the other passengers, which is very quick.  
  (This flight seems almost full, and it took about 30 minutes to get through.)

- The unexpected thing is that all the airport staff can speak Chinese.

- It might be because smaller airports are stricter. Solo travelers like me are often asked how many days they will stay and which places they will visit. Some are even required to show hotel reservations.  
  (So if you're traveling alone, prepare in advance.)

#### Airport WiFi

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*evDWJrEApdI2laaMO01asw.jpeg)

> *Okayama Airport offers free WiFi, but after connecting, you need to enter your email, check your inbox, and click the link to activate it for continuous use; if you only need Visit Japan, you can open the webpage and display the immigration QR code within 10 minutes of connection.*

#### ~= 17:04 Take the bus from Okayama Airport to JR Okayama Station

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*YNxPMPmNH-YBWNemZR6t-Q.jpeg)

[For the latest schedule, please refer to the official website](https://www.okayama-airport.org/tw/access/bus){:target="_blank"}

- The airport is small. Just follow the path outside, and you'll find the bus to Okayama Station. Staff will guide you, so don't worry about getting lost—just hop on the bus.

- **There are few flights, so besides the scheduled departure times, the bus also adds trips according to flight arrival times; no need to worry about being full—if full, another bus will be dispatched.**  
  (According to the [schedule, you have to wait until 19:05 for a bus](https://www.okayama-airport.org/tw/access/bus){:target="_blank"}, but in reality, extra buses are added.)

- [Show your passport before 2024/11/30](https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/Japan_Travel/M.1730096575.A.AB6.html){:target="_blank"} to ride for free; free shuttle service is held irregularly, [it was not available last year](../31b9b3a63abc/).

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*t9I2iSC2-97Dv5fX6FNqWw.png)

- You can check the official website for [stations where you can exchange the JR Pass](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/tc/ticket/receive/?railpass=11&mco=1&area=0){:target="_blank"}. Not every station offers the exchange!  
  (JR Okayama Station is available)

- At Okayama Station, find the ticket vending machines and line up at the green machine in the middle. This is the only one that can exchange JR Pass.

**Redemption Process:**

**Prepare your passport and the purchased JR Pass voucher QR code. You can first select Traditional Chinese from the top right language option, then click the yellow button "QRコードの読取り (QR Code Scan)" at the bottom left to redeem.**

> ***You can choose the start date*** *; the reserved seat time is also counted from the start date. **⚠️***

> *(Like I choose to start tomorrow)*

Follow the steps to scan the JR Pass QR Code and passport to complete the exchange.

The above image uses last year's JR Pass redemption as an example.

After redemption, you will receive three tickets. The other two rectangular ones are instruction manuals and are not useful; **the one marked PASS is the most important. You need this ticket to enter and exit the station, so keep it safe!**

#### Booking JR Reserved Seats

This is very important. According to the information provided by the [JR Pass Kansai & Sanin Area Pass official website](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/tc/ticket/pass/kansai_sanin/){:target="_blank"}, the [**JR YAKUMO train to the Sanin region is all reserved seating**](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/tc/ticket/pass/pdf/Reserved_seats_tc.pdf){:target="_blank"} **with no non-reserved seats ⚠️⚠️⚠️** (starting from March 16, 2024), and all seats must be reserved in advance.

> *You should also be able to book online in advance. [Previously, I booked the JR from Hakata to Yufuin online](https://medium.com/ztravel/%E9%81%8A%E8%A8%98-2024-%E4%BA%8C%E8%A8%AA%E4%B9%9D%E5%B7%9E-9-%E6%97%A5%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E8%A1%8C-%E7%B6%93%E9%87%9C%E5%B1%B1-%E5%8D%9A%E5%A4%9A%E9%83%B5%E8%BC%AA%E5%85%A5%E5%A2%83-cb65fd5ab770?source=collection_home---4------1-----------------------){:target="_blank"}, just need to check.*

**JR Pass Reserved Seat Reservation Process:**

- [**JR Pass Kansai & Sanin Area Pass**](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/tc/ticket/pass/kansai_sanin/){:target="_blank"} **allows up to 6 machine reservations for reserved seats; beyond that, you must book at a manned counter. The number and limits vary by JR Pass region, so please check the official website for details.**

- First, find the English names of the departure location and the destination **JR station names**, for example: OKAYAMA (岡山) -> MATSUE (松江)

- Please note it is the JR station English name, *so [to go to Fukuoka, type Hakata](../d78e0b15a08a/)* XD

- Step one: Select "Traditional Chinese" first.

- Step 2: Directly insert a "JR Pass ticket"  
  (If traveling with multiple people who need to reserve seats together, you will be asked to insert them again in Step 4.)

- Follow the remaining steps as shown in the video below to complete the reservation:

[![JR Pass Reserved Seat Booking Demo](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/9e9f_hqdefault.jpg "JR Pass Reserved Seat Booking Demo")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG8xrxEC6mk){:target="_blank"}

> *The video demonstrates the entire reservation process from Yasugi Station to Tottori Station as an example.*

> *(There was no one in line at the ticket machine, so I dared to take out my phone and record the whole process)*

**Reservation Completed:**

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*9E0CaLNkFZHyp6RfFbW8VQ.png)

- Due to the schedule and tomorrow's itinerary, I booked the 07:05 train to Songjiang to drop off luggage at the hotel.

- **Actual entry and exit still use the JR Pass (the one shown above)** ⚠️⚠️⚠️, the reserved seat ticket only shows your car and seat number.

- No window seats left, only aisle seats QQ

I casually bought a fried beef steak bento at Okayama Station and some food and drinks at a convenience store, then went to the hotel to rest. Okayama Station is under renovation, and I will return to Okayama on the last day of the trip.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*5OK4O6vRpvTbBHY1or45Ww.jpeg)

It takes five minutes to walk from Momotaro Shopping Street to the hotel.

#### ~= 19:00 Return to the hotel to eat and rest

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*0XBFIrZROFSOuAr7psn7NA.jpeg)

The bento portion was a bit small, but the Okayama white peach peach wine was very tasty! Along with the nostalgic Japanese convenience store (FamilyMart) hot dog and fried chicken, tonight was very satisfying. Good night, Okayama! Preparing well for an early start to the Japan trip tomorrow.

#### [Okayama Korakuen Light-Up](http://genso-teien.okayama.jp/){:target="_blank"}

The 2024 light-up event at Okayama Korakuen Garden is from Friday, November 15 to Sunday, November 24. It wasn’t on the day I visited; if the lights are on, it’s worth seeing as it’s very beautiful.

### Day 2 (11/13 Wednesday) Shimane — Izumo Taisha, Sunset at Lake Shinji

#### 07:05 Take the Yakumo やくも train No. 1 to Matsue

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*m4JyAVEfNrUoaIt1Hk3Zeg.jpeg)

The car interior is quite comfortable, with luggage areas in the front and back for direct storage. The seats also have charging ports.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*vg7v1Xz5RlcQ9KqnMwiZjw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*M8ciQoiAy5GWHQoa34vo1w.png)

The total journey takes about 2 hours and 45 minutes. You can feel the ride passing through mountains and ridges. Early in the morning, many areas are still shrouded in mist, giving a sense of entering a hidden paradise through mountain tunnels. Unfortunately, I didn't get a window seat, so I could only watch the scenery from afar.

#### 09:49 Arrive at Songjiang

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*RNcfgkoIlBNqAbZiJGXUeA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*wuK_7kxYguDnQoYd5nNXtA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*GfeSKNvv30aqgIOUIcVAzw.jpeg)

The weather in Matsue is fantastic ☀️. After arriving at Matsue Station, I headed straight to the hotel for tonight’s stay, [**Matsue Urban Hotel**](https://www.station.matsue-urban.co.jp/en/){:target="_blank"}, to drop off my luggage.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*YCar9o50KKuyrx5blLVipg.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*58UjwwimiMZZS5fhCc2o7w.jpeg)

After dropping off the luggage, return to Songjiang Station around 10:00 and rebook a seat for Yakumo No. 3 departing from Songjiang to Izumo City at 10:48.

> ***I should have booked the seat yesterday for Okayama to Matsue and also booked another seat from Matsue to Izumo City*** *because I wanted to watch the sunset in the afternoon, so I left my luggage in Matsue first. Otherwise, I would have gone straight to Izumo City to avoid wasting time changing trains.*

> *You can also take the Ichibata Electric Railway Taisha Line to Izumo Taisha, which takes about the same time.*

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Wvd6qczYLcEb8XywbGV_Vg.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Ji2S8d1orIkJB5Wyu3DCSw.jpeg)

There was still some time, so I went to the convenience store to buy two rice balls, coffee, and fried chicken to take as lunch.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*OkaENzl4tJ0nSMqMSznEmw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*NNFURE5UfVdWOgkpYuAtrg.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*5-vTR2_TeMIlIiPggNON5w.jpeg)

Along the way, you will pass Lake Shinjiko, which is so vast that at first, you might think it's the sea, but it's actually a lake.

> *You need to book a window seat on side D to directly see Lake Shikotsu. I booked side A by the mountain and can't see it QQ.*

#### 11:12 Arrive at Izumo City

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*IGzRRA0zChR7eosgVBM30g.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*_dWPzssuOTsPLhGlPeaxBg.jpeg)

After arriving at Matsue Station, I ran all the way to catch the 11:25 Ichibata Electric Railway North Matsue Line heading to Kawato Station.

> *Ichibata Electric Railway does not accept transit cards for entry. You must first buy a ticket at the automatic ticket machine near the entrance (electronic payment accepted). If you're unsure how to buy, just tell the staff you want to go to `Izumo Taisha`.*

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*zOWAvtPBUa4Q6p_O0UI_4A.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*hqp8E0znWzflcoF_wdXbYA.jpeg)

At Kawaji Station, you need to transfer trains (follow everyone to the opposite platform) to take the Ichibata Electric Railway Taisha Line toward Izumo Taisha-mae Station.

#### Arrive at Izumo Taisha around 12 o'clock

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*DbbHj7dvLzIZ5yucQPqW2Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*TNniVRe3T0Lx2h8ZEO6UoQ.png)

The Omotesando in front of the shrine is serene and beautiful. If you have time, there are many small shops and delicious foods to explore here.

> *Later, I learned that the four torii gates of Izumo are also famous. One of the large white torii gates can be found at the entrance by walking from Izumo Station's Omotesando in the opposite direction of the shrine:*

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*lL6Lshf934FqRMAHwuf8Sw.png)

Walk up to the entrance of Izumo Taisha. The visit date, `2024/11/13`, coincides with the **Kamiari Festival** period (`2024 Reiwa 6 Year 11/11~11/17`), so many Japanese visitors come to pray.

> *Every year in Japan, during the lunar October (November in the Gregorian calendar), eight million gods gather in Izumo for the "Divine Council" to discuss human affairs, such as fate arrangements and harmony with nature.*

> *Therefore, **this month is called "Kannazuki" (the month without gods) in other regions of Japan and mostly has no festivals**.*

> ***In Izumo, this is called the "Month of the Gods," meaning only the Izumo region has the gods.***

> *The festival includes the "Kami-mukae Festival" to welcome the gods, the "Enmusubi Grand Festival" to pray for good relationships, and the "Kami-okuri Festival" to send off the gods*

> ***Izumo Taisha Main Deity: Ōkuninushi no Mikoto***

What a coincidence! When I was scheduling the time, I didn’t intentionally choose this slot. I only found out when I was looking up information about the attraction.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*IVJtJR2htbOjimqgqKvLrg.png)

After passing through the entrance torii gate, it takes about another 5 minutes to reach the shrine.

#### Japan's Largest "Hinomaru" National Flag

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*WBerwVlV_I8PeYqj2KRX1w.png)

After entering the shrine, look to the left to see a tall flagpole with Japan's largest Hinomaru flag (about 75 tatami mats, 137 square meters).

Walk towards this flagpole to reach the "Kaguraden," where you can find Japan's largest [Shimenawa](https://sanin-japan.com/zh-tw/special/territory-of-the-gods-yokozuna-and-izumo-taisha/){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*x8zuQYtIXNILxGLkMjQbJg.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*KeY6bAoW8DsPQf4BtMuhcA.jpeg)

Up close, it is truly huge, especially compared to the typical shimenawa at other shrines, about 10 times larger. (Length: 14 meters, weight: 5 tons, replaced every few years, handmade)

> *Please remember that the largest one is at the "Kaguraden," not the main hall as I initially thought.*

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*L3BUl_V1wCtc9hiRiiGlqw.jpeg)

After walking around, there were quite a few people, and some had to wait in long lines to pray.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*_DCfvI3CSAqMeC0hnZzCHA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*uKMCGxlcrtLXp_wuz0Okqg.png)

After the visit, I took a stamp collection book and stamped the Izumo Taisha commemorative seal.

Due to limited time, I didn't visit other shrines in Izumo. Without driving, it also felt difficult to explore them.

#### ~= 12:45 Walk to Inasa Beach Inasa no Hama

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*tp8izFV2pcWAkHrOxguusw.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*RQmCSnIsPBVcJW1r9nSS3w.jpeg)

The bus runs infrequently, so you have to walk, which takes about 15 minutes. Along the way, you'll pass the grave of Izumo Okuni. Walking all the way leads you to Inasa Beach.

> ***Inasahama:***

Walk back to the Izumo Taisha bus stop to take the bus back to JR Izumo Station.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*AqsQ2S3q61tJaq7k6fgdIA.jpeg)

You can see a continuous line of vehicles waiting to enter the Izumo Taisha parking lot for worship.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*XrDT2aXpUPfF7NT5IEFFNA.jpeg)

Izumo Taisha bus stop is behind the souvenir shop, past the restroom. It's small, so I was worried about waiting at the wrong place at first.

**It was about 13:15, and I had to wait until 13:40 for the bus back to JR Izumo Station. Feeling very hungry, I first went to the souvenir shop ahead and bought some snacks nearby to eat by hand.**

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*FYPk9dJKH166TgfMJbKinA.jpeg)

Bought a few chūnibyō stickers at the souvenir shop.

#### **13:40 Take the bus back to JR Izumo Station**

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*gvzJ1xXYnLyxNU_HAlFyNA.jpeg)

> *On the way back to Izumo, a Japanese person asked to borrow my power bank because his phone was completely dead. I took the chance to confirm with him (and practice the few Japanese phrases I remember), " **このバスは JR 出雲市駅へ行きますか** " He replied, " **はい** " (I only understood "hai").*

#### ~= 14:15 Return to JR Izumoshi Station

(Heading to see the sunset at Lake Shinji before it sets, according to information **Sunset at 17:05 on that day**)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*roLGAz0BE_7yrZ7010cJ1w.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*JxPpTZphqlQpjXjOlEmRfA.jpeg)

This time, I didn't take the Yakumo train. I took the 14:54 local train to Yonago and followed Google Maps' suggestion to get off at Nogi Station and walk to the Shinjiko Sunset Viewing Spot.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*6-c6bp49Is4qZ_IdbiMPCg.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*kXIIylCmu_fP_FA6IGQ3_g.png)

#### ~=15:35 Arrive at Nogi Station

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*5mXpmq_hk-UlrD_KF-x1xg.png)

Nogi Station is very small, with no station staff or ticket gates. **If you are using a JR Pass, just exit the station directly. Do not foolishly leave your JR Pass in the ticket box. ⚠️⚠️⚠️**

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*hiBPok9dbi9XGQeAPRQ5NQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*MAtnP-62r3MY0NSPPSy0yg.jpeg)

Walking from Nogi Station was a bit of a mistake; this area is quite deserted with few people around...

Fortunately, there was a 7–11 along the way where we bought hot dogs, fried chicken, and drinks to enjoy while waiting for the sunset.

#### 16:00 Sunset at Lake Shinji

Going up leads to the Shimane Prefectural Art Museum, which is livelier and has cafes; however, the stair platform offers a better scenic angle.

#### 16:45 Sunset in the West

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*rmwJe1rnyjhQkJ9erx7q_w.jpeg)

At first, I didn't feel much, but as the sunset approached, I began to appreciate the charm of the first sunset. The egret earlier also blended perfectly with the scenery.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*CdDLOmzP80ovaY94HDD3Wg.jpeg)

After the sun approaches the horizon, time seems to pass visibly fast to the naked eye, with the sun descending every minute and second.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*pT7mh8XcC_Xt1_BO61SbfQ.jpeg)

Quickly, by 17:01, the sun was no longer visible.

[There are sightseeing boats on Lake Shinji](https://www.kankou-shimane.com/zh-tw/destinations/1086){:target="_blank"}, which you can take near sunset to enjoy the view from the boat. I would like to try it next time I visit.

#### 18:00 Return to Songjiang Station and Hotel

#### Buy some souvenirs at the gift shop on the first floor of Songjiang Station

I thought San'in is quite unique, so I'll buy souvenirs here.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*fQj5GAdIRZ8uKKofUerGSw.png)

What’s special is the beef bone broth ramen, usually it’s pork bone broth. I bought a box to try back in Taiwan.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*P175dGuAEKQkW-rvGbIIeg.jpeg)

Bought two big boxes of cookies (good for sharing with colleagues) to share with coworkers. The sweet ones are ordinary but are souvenirs from Izumo Taisha Shrine, while the salty seafood pancake cookies I found very tasty!

#### Return to the hotel

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*e3EL2ltwD0nNVb2TbJzonQ.jpeg)

This building has no elevator. The booking is for Building 2, which can be accessed from this building's lobby via a skybridge. On the 2nd floor of Building 2, there is a lounge with a microwave, laundry room, and vending machines.

> *The experience at Building 2 didn't feel very safe. The elevator has no access control, and the [1st and 2nd floors are capsule hotels](https://www.cubic-room.jp/en/){:target="_blank"}, making entry and exit more complicated. It's also far from the main lobby, so after checking in, I used my suitcase to block the door, fearing someone strange might break in.*

[![Youtube](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/cfdf_hqdefault.jpg "Youtube")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLHi7arAioA){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*jXAp31kbI-h2r6EC9p3GTg.png)

In the lobby, you can get free face masks, coffee, and tea bags.

#### Foraging

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*rNzPDu9gW2s89oW0oqxWSA.jpeg)

After check-in, I went out to find food. It was quite cold, dark, and quiet outside. I quickly grabbed a takeout bento from a restaurant near the station and bought some snacks and drinks at a convenience store, then returned to the hotel.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*FaaPod-j1hdncbRKhnNUOQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Oubxpe7aZ2GPBXI92NEMuQ.jpeg)

The beef tongue bento is delicious, and the peach sparkling wine bought at the convenience store is also tasty.

> *Good night, Songjiang.*

**Also bought almost the same next-day breakfast set every day…**

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*YTezWlFUnTYd6qv1J-yjTw.jpeg)

This pulp juice from FamilyMart is a must-drink every time I visit Japan!

#### Matsue Shinji Lake 24-Hour Live Stream:

[![【LIVE】Matsue・Shinji Lake Live Camera](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/d2d9_hqdefault.jpg "【LIVE】Matsue・Shinji Lake Live Camera")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYIjp0flsdQ){:target="_blank"}

A YouTube channel I stumbled upon that shows the weather and scenery of Lake Shinji.

### Day 3 (11/14 Thursday) Matsue Horikawa Sightseeing Boat, Matsue Castle, Adachi Museum of Art

Early in the morning, first leave the luggage at the hotel, then take the bus from Songjiang Bus Station to the Songjiang Castle cruise.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*6Urhj-Bh4CXFgweozc99fQ.png)

Google Maps does not show the platform; you can only see it on-site. Trains at platform 2 go to Songjiangcheng.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*4i5NFX226vWGW4yTEqOqIw.jpeg)

Get off in front of the County Civic Hall and walk towards Songjiang Castle. You can see the "Horikawa Sightseeing Boat" boarding area near the parking lot.

#### Activate the JR Pass [**San'in San'yō Area Pass 3-Day Ticket**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20307-jr-sanin-okayama-area-pass?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} **Free ride** on the Horikawa Sightseeing Boat

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*dBYTcpDfIH02XoGUtviyTQ.png)

1. Download [Discover Another Japan App](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/discover-another-japan/id1530307213){:target="_blank"}

2. Copy the serial number from the certificate email

3. Open the app, select "Input," paste the serial number, and press "Activate."

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*bXVG4mS9rEj5I2nV8hUpqQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*6s5mwpiKNIIC3bNIw48qjw.jpeg)

Switch to "Use" to fill out the health questionnaire. After completing it, a QR Code camera will appear; scan the QR Code provided by the store and show them the result to complete the redemption.

You can also click "Target Content" to view redeemable items.

> ***The actual calculation time starts from the first time the target is redeemed*** *, not from when the serial number is activated (I entered it on 11/13).*

**Here are some popular locations you can use:**

- Shinji Lake Sightseeing Boat, original price 1,800 yen

- Matsue Castle Boat Tour, original price 1,600 yen

- Adachi Museum of Art, original price 2,300 yen

- Matsue Castle, original price 680 yen

- Tottori Sand Dunes Museum of Art, original price 800 yen

- Tsutenkaku Tower, original price 800 yen

- Okayama Korakuen, original price 410 yen

It's really a great deal. Just adding up the above savings amounts to 8,390 yen, which is already half the price of the entire JR Pass.

#### 09:15 Take the Songjiang Tour Boat

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*yTUoyuDBmxnZi7Z-LW5scg.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*D0KiYKloofkru6tcupBTWw.jpeg)

Directly redeem and ride for free with the [3-Day Tour Pass](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20307-jr-sanin-okayama-area-pass?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}.

- This year is warmer, so the kotatsu boat hasn't been turned on yet.

- There are four bridges where the boat must lower its body. Be careful not to get your hands caught.

- About 50 minutes in total

- **Please take off your shoes before boarding** ⚠️

- **Only the right row facing the boatman can directly see the view of Songjiang City. The farther from the boatman, the closer to the bow (= the first row just inside)** ⚠️ As shown in the picture below

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*NNpCqdpowVo3qcGUB2MtIA.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*7hUFpDj5m7TYkRzY_QhrOA.jpeg)

It might be because the maple leaf season hasn't started yet, so there aren't many people. There were only four people on the boat, making it very spacious.

[![Matsue Horikawa Canal Boat Passing Under Bridge](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/81ca_hqdefault.jpg "Matsue Horikawa Canal Boat Passing Under Bridge")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dP7cQcqkW8){:target="_blank"}

There are four bridges that lower the ship's deck when passing underneath, so you need to bend down slightly to pass through.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*f71WOF93FIEGnY_AFJ94OQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*mqX7jwzT8WnOhg9hwZKZPA.jpeg)

Cruising along the river with the wind is very pleasant, and the boatman also introduces the surrounding sights and history along the way (although I only understood "hidari" for left and "migi" for right…).

![<https://youtube.com/shorts/KA9xKZV16bk>{:target="_blank"}](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*vY1xPWmFrFq7m4ErBFYRAQ.jpeg)

<https://youtube.com/shorts/KA9xKZV16bk>{:target="_blank"}

Near the end, close to the return point, there is a Matsue Castle photo spot where you can capture a distant view of Matsue Castle.

The boat tour ends around 10:00.

#### 10:15 Matsue Castle

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*ceaDL6BSPF0gB-VCXOw3fA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*KTDVdtsyThXmXZC0hlXqPQ.jpeg)

The direction back from the boat leads to the entrance of Matsue Castle on the other side. Walking uphill will take you to Matsue Castle.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*1zbsEA6XAM1EhL6AoGwyng.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*PNjiGAlCMJvOWEgPCi6Vrg.jpeg)

Passing by Matsue Shrine, we arrive at Matsue Castle.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*rrtm3CezY7W1ZWPIbj5p-A.jpeg)

Due to limited time, I decided to continue on to the Adachi Museum of Art and did not go up.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*9JAHlSW6QmLNzAWDU0-THA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*XmGdiTwZJk7pWY95CCZkrQ.jpeg)

Wait for the bus going back at the bus stop in front of the Prefectural Citizens' Hall, opposite to the direction you came from.

#### ~=10:30 Return to the hotel to pick up luggage

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*z5o-twtGfhsaje84wIlhlA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*cG2vaqw6VB1jXg2Eg78Jnw.jpeg)

Around 10:30, return to Songjiang Station and go back to the hotel to pick up your luggage.

> ***Almost got hit by a bike with brake failure while waiting at the traffic light here. Luckily, I was standing further back and avoided it. Always be careful when you're out.*** *⚠️⚠️⚠️*

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*J13Zlai29b-V7OR6-NSDuw.jpeg)

After arriving at the station, also reserve a seat on Yakumo 14 bound for Yasugi (安来) (Adachi Museum of Art).

#### 11:03 Head to Anlai

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*-eYBNFeXAXeaT3i73YPeRg.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*49TFnjK8AnLDrYCA-naQtw.jpeg)

11:03 Departure time, bought some food near the station to eat on the bus.

> ***Goodbye, Songjiang.***

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*g-Sewe5VgTJrqioiNt32mw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*gCedzvZrVNY7_hfPkBBtEg.jpeg)

The waffles and the savory roasted chicken are both very delicious.

#### 11:12 Arrived at Anlai Station

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*6VLLQilNbIvambZZ2FqlTg.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*fzfeXO1wERdPoGfoSeImew.jpeg)

Don't rush to exit the station at Yasugi Station. Find the tourist information center to store large luggage.  
(There are coin lockers outside the station, but they are often full.)

#### 11:30 Take the shuttle bus to Adachi Museum of Art

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*BHs4S2OQTB2L5GC5beFFCQ.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Ng6cROhDXC8dFa-jX9Rr9g.jpeg)

[For the latest timetable, please refer to the official website](https://www.adachi-museum.or.jp/en/shuttle-bus){:target="_blank"}

After placing the luggage, take the shuttle bus to Adachi Museum of Art (free, board in order while queuing). There were not many people when I came in the morning.

Walk through the rural alleys for about 20 minutes to reach the Adachi Museum of Art.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*yWU0ZbZ-BplOe9PpE7gLKw.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*dKhsS-vXIfeBwam-mmARTQ.jpeg)

After getting off, walk straight ahead to reach the entrance of the Adachi Museum of Art.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Q_wkpK8esb5iKNWHxOf4vg.jpeg)

Similarly, use the [3-Day Pass](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20307-jr-sanin-okayama-area-pass?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} to redeem free admission.

The first step is to collect a "shuttle bus ticket" at the front desk before the entrance according to your schedule, one ticket per person; when the time comes, return to the drop-off point and use the ticket to take the shuttle back to Anlai Station.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*mxWMQacl1bNSfdRo8X9JQA.png)

My itinerary is to take the JR departing from Yasugi at 14:46 heading to Tottori. Please note **there are not many trains going to Tottori⚠️.**

> ***Very important! Very important! Very important! Be sure to get it, or there’s no guarantee of a seat on the bus. ⚠️⚠️⚠️***

> *I was the one who didn't know I needed a ticket. I was supposed to take the 13:00 train but realized I needed a ticket, so I went back to get it and took the 13:35 train back to Anlai.*

> *Fortunately, I gave myself plenty of time.*

#### Adachi Museum of Art — Japan's Top Garden

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*P4YjMlS0gulw8Z9Jr4a2mA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*bBghMwu_IRFmgbT7fW3EXw.jpeg)

You can quietly sit here and enjoy the courtyard view.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*U6yP0ur5hbX5RPLBCUJhOA.jpeg)

Besides the garden, the core of the Adachi Museum of Art is its many art collections. Photography is prohibited. Follow the route to view the artworks and the garden.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*wBCdJ9HmdU55eywoII8eZQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*ftl17PV6R9Xvj6u_W2uTeg.jpeg)

You can see part of the courtyard landscape outside, which clearly shows that a lot of time and effort has been spent maintaining this design.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*jNTMLjG2TDFOdTE4Sl72DA.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*tcvXnD0yZU2J36q-7DFPPw.jpeg)

There are two cafes inside, offering not only desserts and coffee but also savory dishes; feel free to stop by, rest, have a bite, and enjoy the view.

> *Since I was alone, I didn't particularly stop to eat.*

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*r-y6_oqYcCr7gHBkO2htAw.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*P2G-cBOftGDBhXjRe93JmA.png)

Bought a cardboard reproduction of a museum painting seen at the souvenir shop: [Yokoyama Taikan “Mt.Fuji” painting](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/mt-fuji/gQGjCiwQOJy4bg?hl=zh-TW){:target="_blank"} as a keepsake.

#### 12:30 Stroll around the outdoor shopping street

There is a small shopping street outside. Since it was still early, I wandered around there first.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*F0w3N5TCBhJnHxDTPKvIlw.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*vUCovPlzvYxsnyfTqahbdg.jpeg)

> *This Shimane Wagyu rice burger is **quite bad**. It's just a microwaved rice burger with sticky rice, and the Wagyu in the middle I ate was still cold and not fully heated…*

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*04ZXVwciPcQrHZaCi_mP_A.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*IIi5iKRgO4Z3X-WVGXSAlg.jpeg)

As mentioned earlier, I didn't know I needed a ticket at first and foolishly waited for the bus. It wasn't until 1:00 PM that I realized I couldn't board and then went to get a ticket for 1:35 PM.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*_qEUfX9ZPhw4e7GoCkd1mA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*CYcgaIGY63OyZ8AVqxp6zQ.jpeg)

Hold the full ticket and re-enter (re-entry allowed). Sit in the original indoor viewing area to relax, enjoy the view, and wait for the bus.

#### 13:55 Return to Yasugi Station

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*32LdARFSPE8UZX5Ncpp__Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*wiaNCbcWfMAr83dH_VyhVg.jpeg)

On the way back to Anlai Station, I saw very bright red maple leaves.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*hmDP79nt4683WCrugG3F6A.png)

At this time, there are actually more people visiting the Adachi Museum of Art.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*pNI1d_ksSnexO0WKcSSLww.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*9O3RZpisQ42q9L5HBVfK2w.jpeg)

This station isn't crowded, and it's still early, so I took the chance to record a short video demonstrating how to reserve a seat with the JR Pass. [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/oG8xrxEC6mk){:target="_blank"}.

Wandering around the tourist information center to kill time.

Arriving here, Kiyomizu-dera also feels like a hidden spot for enjoying autumn leaves.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*2gCmHxDsPcbPLcngamFmpg.jpeg)

The train model is very old and only has two cars (one free seating, one reserved seating). My 26-inch suitcase couldn't fit in the overhead luggage rack (newer JR trains can, but this model's rack is too small). I forgot that I could walk to the last row and place it behind the last seat, so I had to squeeze it into my own seat area.

Fortunately, there was no one next to me the whole way. The unreserved cars seemed more crowded, while the reserved seats here were only about 60% full.

> *Due to the itinerary, I did not specifically visit GeGeGe no Kitaro Station (Sakaiminato Station) or Conan Station (Yura Station).*

Head to tonight's hotel [**Toyoko INN Tottori Station South Exit**](https://www.toyoko-inn.com/china/search/detail/00046/){:target="_blank"}. There is also a Toyoko INN at the North Exit, but I couldn't book there. The North Exit area has a livelier shopping street.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*mOuFR0sVsVoQ1RxuPH3YlA.jpeg)

Around 18:00, I walked to the area near Tottori North Exit Shopping Street to find food. I had been eating randomly for the past few days, so today I wanted to find a better restaurant.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*UPSjd6gbL9TCVXl8qXLPvw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*_Qkjzr6Xf_PV642XoYTcgw.jpeg)

I found a Tottori Wagyu restaurant with good reviews on the main street — "[Niku Ryori Nick](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pSZF8bCsiRNJ4aSt6){:target="_blank"}" to try Tottori Wagyu. Not sure if it’s a weekday, but I was the only one there.

> *Tottori Wagyu is not as famous as Kobe or Omi beef, but Tottori is the **birthplace of Japanese Wagyu culture**.*

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*sI_cXfEuxYrVLS6SUqDArQ.png)

I ordered the "Tottori Wagyu Hitsumabushi" Tottori Wagyu three-way rice for 3,500 yen, which is much cheaper than Kobe beef.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*qkqZMeWtQcobrIOS8mrBJw.jpeg)

Tottori Wagyu is very tender but has less beefy flavor. At first, eating pure Wagyu doesn’t have much taste.

Second and third servings, combined with the included soup, make for a delicious ochazuke.

#### 18:30 Return to the station and hotel after eating

Bought late-night snacks on the way back to the hotel to eat at night, also got Y1000 Yakult 1000. This time, I didn't really drink much but still slept well...

> *Good night, Tottori.*

### Day 4 (11/15 Friday) White Rabbit Shrine, Tottori Sand Dunes, Himeji

In the morning, first visit the White Rabbit Shrine (for matchmaking) to pray. Return to the north exit of Tottori Station and walk towards the bus terminal. Pass through the bus hall and wait at platform 4 at the back for the bus.

Before getting off, insert coins according to the amount shown on the screen. Since we boarded at the last stop without a ticket, we paid the amount shown one step before the first slot.

#### ~= 09:30 Arrive at Shirahige Shrine

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*m33qZ2cJ4FwqBjkb-6IsAg.png)

After getting off, walk back towards the pedestrian bridge to reach the entrance of the White Rabbit Shrine.

> *The White Rabbit Shrine originates from the legend of the "White Rabbit of Inaba." According to the legend, Okuninushi (from Izumo Taisha) helped an injured white rabbit recover, received its blessing, and successfully won the love of Princess Yakami-hime.*

> *The White Rabbit Shrine symbolizes good relationships and healing. Both shrines share the sacred meaning of praying for happiness and connections.*

The shrine is not far away, but along the way, there are many rabbit statues, all piled with love stones.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*KCuCyqwlHaza-Kz1r2J2Pw.jpeg)

The shrine is not very large and can be visited in about 15–20 minutes.

There really is a white rabbit kept inside the tourist information center. They also sell some snacks and souvenirs. I bought a bread to fill my stomach.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*rXW71tg5gJziOeVd5X3iRw.jpeg)

The bus to Tottori Station doesn't come until 10:45. It's better to arrive earlier and take an earlier bus to save time.

from: Sheng Wei

> ***Remember to take a ticket when boarding; it has a number. When getting off, insert the corresponding amount of coins along with the ticket based on the number.*** *⚠️*

On the bus, I met a tourist from Fujian, China. His itinerary was the opposite of mine; he was going to Himeji first, then Shimane. We exchanged recommendations: he suggested visiting Shoshazan Engyo-ji Temple before Himeji Castle, and recommended taking photos at the spot shown in the picture near Himeji Castle.

> ***Thanks to him! In the end, it was definitely worth it.***

Get off at Aioicho, then transfer at the opposite bus stop to a bus heading toward Tottori Sand Dunes.

The bus I took stops at the east entrance of the sand dunes, where I got off and walked up.

> *Take ticket number 3 when boarding. When getting off, check the screen for the amount corresponding to number 3 and insert the coins. In this example, you need to pay 250 yen.*

My Confusing Tour Route.

After getting off, turn back at the fork and follow the signs uphill, passing the Tottori Sand Dunes Museum, and continue walking to the entrance of the Tottori Sand Dunes.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*87V9nbswSrqQfx3JcDcVYQ.jpeg)

The Tottori Sand Dunes are really vast. The sky was a bit overcast and rainy at the time, but if it were sunny, it would probably be very hot.

#### ~=12:00 Arrive at Tottori Sand Dunes

Japan's largest sand dune.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*WkiGJSHcUrPZi5h7zSJGYA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*lwqbSawD2wG3wO1MyAf2Bg.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*NEuDeBgnNxtTSaYVQCd2NQ.jpeg)

People look very small. Walking up to the dune ridge, I felt a bit shaky, and the loose sand made it hard to walk.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Gu98SJFPwWWKTj5PQR0zUw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*S44sCcfn1C1zx3--fIIoBw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*w0d4u78ensGTedfoTINN4g.jpeg)

At the highest point, you can overlook the entire coastline. The scene of sand dunes at your back and the sea in front is unique to this place.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*B-Oqyt2XYx4TVTMblCdEdw.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*9ZoPtPjdHz3aaFTGNDT8iw.jpeg)

According to online information, camel riding is usually available, but today it seems unavailable due to bad weather.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*9WiZqF_alWi6M1PrHwG3sg.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*JxF65EE6eeACd1uRENVwNQ.jpeg)

Looking back one last time at the Tottori Sand Dunes, they really are huge; some sand inevitably got into my shoes, **I saw someone cleverly wearing plastic shoe covers directly.**

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*6cq3xUwokLToOCx38TXV9g.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*OacuYCefS-wThnPRbo49xw.jpeg)

You can take the cable car directly to the Tottori Sand Dunes Observatory. I planned to go there first but decided to try the famous Tottori No.1 Sand Dune pudding downstairs, so I didn't take the cable car. Later, I walked up since it was on the way and not far (~15 minutes only).

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*SkKPyRhs_REhQrWDiLluNQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*30ZIWteqj87esh4ptH2w7A.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*6LhlMpfWyszDfyJ7PTf1vQ.jpeg)

Coming out from the parking lot, you can see the Tottori Sand Dunes "Takahama Cafe 高濱咖啡廳" designed by Kengo Kuma across the street.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*3OinDP-RDFHBQHLpY0olPw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*iGxKRD9KvMZrGuuHEjGNcA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*YA0J3gRmOPgWhacPYV0LEg.jpeg)

Bought one to try, the taste is really good. The pudding has a rich milk flavor and a texture similar to custard.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*cRVlgCNRJysVUNkOkCHgFg.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*TafJZGPlGd5gft3gYj8Q3A.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*sF3liqjkM6eQ6KURqwEfxA.jpeg)

The specialty is that they give you a small packet of sugar that looks like sand, which you add and eat together.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*qOmSScKgkmuIBhtPJKcbiA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*hv6d0AdzA-Ubx4XTqW8ZXQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*30_-rtFKE2Az1z6ikKIOSg.jpeg)

There are some restaurants along the road where you can eat. Continuing back, there is a small path; walk up a short distance, and on the right is the second entrance to the Sand Dunes Art Museum. On the left, a bit further up, is the "Tottori Sand Dunes Observatory," where the cable car arrives.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*D9v4msXBz0mfsAWzXugtTw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*N9shdulrUJo5pphjg4lKMw.jpeg)

First, head left to the Tottori Sand Dunes Observatory to enjoy the view and have some food. You will arrive at the cable car boarding area first.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*mo37aWPygCHfl-dAetnVQg.jpeg)

You can first go to the vending area and nearby to get a brush to clean the sand off your shoes. (The staff at the entrance will also remind you)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*gTZJLV-MjOhVf3kxsPHwmg.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*lQX5yEbrhiEqUxf6ekViVw.jpeg)

Finally, I waited here for the bus back to Tottori.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Re9IYuYqgtJre9oHgws_aA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*GLQ1-BDnEqB25ZBp2X3BAA.jpeg)

The first and second floors of the observation deck sell souvenirs and have a small restaurant. The third floor offers a view of the Tottori Sand Dunes (though there's not much to see).

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*fyEhTboh7RX-ZXqz9-FCPw.png)

There aren't many food options inside. You need to first buy the corresponding meal ticket from the nearby vending machine, then enter, find a seat, and hand the ticket to the staff.

Just had an oyster set meal.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*bN0RPnkejfCFjKjmcGwNCw.png)

Also bought some Tottori souvenirs here.

#### 13:30 Dune Art Museum

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*30_-rtFKE2Az1z6ikKIOSg.jpeg)

After eating, head down from Entrance No. 2 to visit the Sand Dunes Art Museum. (Also free admission with the [**3-Day Pass**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20307-jr-sanin-okayama-area-pass?cid=19365){:target="_blank"})

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*NALOYc1jrxf6O7nYgweBvg.png)

Starting from Entrance No. 2, the visit begins with the sand sculptures outside, then continues down from the 3rd floor to the 2nd floor. Inside the venue, only the 2nd floor has sand sculptures. The venue is small, and if it weren't free, I probably wouldn't have entered.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*bRQIVt04vcixxfHrHh2_yg.jpeg)

Although the venue is small, each sand sculpture is detailed and exquisite.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*lB74w9zvrdIiJBqpIIIT7g.png)

There is also a silly QR code for the Dune Art Museum that you can scan.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*lZu_yUKJOB44L4wuG04uRA.jpeg)

After walking around, I went back up to the Tottori Sand Dunes Observatory. I wandered around and ate a Tottori pear ice cream. Around 14:20, I waited at the bus stop and caught the 14:42 bus heading to Tottori Station.

> *The bus returning to Tottori was already nearly full when it arrived, so I barely managed to squeeze on. If you have time, it might be better to board at the previous stop.*

#### 2025/01 Update

I only saw after returning that Tottori offers taxi charter one-day tours due to less convenient transportation. [For details, please refer to the visitor center or this website](https://chugoku.letsgojp.com/archives/661034){:target="_blank"}.

#### 15:10 Return to Tottori Station

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*zD1KRkIAiYp-wtxk48AogA.png)

Around 15:10, we returned to Tottori Station, and it started to rain.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*cfJLhRhuQjLhQqWfzVqgFA.jpeg)

Wandering around the shops at the station, the souvenir store here also sells Dune pudding!

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*-Q6nYvGZP-PBIgMdW6Lk2A.jpeg)

I originally planned to visit Tottori’s famous すなば珈琲 (Sunaba Coffee), but they were already closed after 3 PM. So I found a nana’s green tea inside the station to have some dessert and coffee to rest and recharge (both myself and my phone needed charging).

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*a6nZx2RTbeZAsTfxOvTPKw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*UrMfxX9LNlDIR7suza8tCQ.jpeg)

The store is comfortable and not crowded.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*4RdqbhEiL0vrRwrMKnIXLw.jpeg)

Warabi mochi + ice cream + hot coffee, very satisfying.

#### 16:15 Return to the hotel to pick up luggage, then go back to the station to wait for the train

Booked a front-row seat in the Green Car, very comfortable.

It happened to be their councilor election, and outside the venue, a councilor was giving a campaign speech with a large crowd.

After exiting the station, go directly to the hotel [**Toyoko INN Himeji Station Shinkansen North Exit**](https://www.toyoko-inn.com/china/search/detail/00317/){:target="_blank"}. The last three nights were all spent here. The Toyoko INN near the north exit is livelier; it looks close on the map, but it actually feels a bit farther, taking about 10 minutes to walk.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*VT_z6TemLvMX-ujCfUewiQ.jpeg)

The room assigned on the 14th floor rooftop has a great view outside the window.

You can directly look back at Himeji Station railway from the window. Trains passing by make slight track noises, but fortunately, there are no trains after night.

#### 19:00 Go out for a casual food hunt

When I first saw the night view of Himeji Castle, I thought it was beautiful. For some reason, I decided to walk to Himeji Castle to take night photos. Being too close made it hard to frame good shots, so I didn’t take many pictures and left quickly. It was cold and I was hungry the whole way. I should have just gone straight to eat.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*dy69JBLXC40kKDIYB3adGw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*dyjiO-KVxTv99UskMZs9Ag.jpeg)

Himeji Castle is about 1 kilometer from the station, and it took nearly 30 minutes to walk round trip.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*tnvYT7YGcklotJdPdfpY8w.jpeg)

Finally, I found that the viewing platform on the second floor of the station's north exit is the best spot to photograph Himeji Castle.

Before buying dinner, I took a short walk and tried some capsule toys at the department store [Piole Himeji](https://www.jrw-urban.co.jp/piole-himeji/tw){:target="_blank"} near Himeji Station.

#### ~=20:00 Buy dinner and go back

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*piFnI5vcIs2l8lG5gQZRdg.jpeg)

Walk from the second-floor skybridge to the adjacent TERASSO and find a yakiniku restaurant that is still open to take out a yakiniku bento to eat back at the hotel.

Stopped by a convenience store and bought some food and drinks.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*1nvfzK3jA2eVr-tTRIAUBw.jpeg)

After eating and drinking, taking a shower, I went downstairs to do laundry. This time, knowing that Toyoko requires you to bring your own detergent, I first bought washing powder with coins and put it in the washing machine along with my clothes. The dryer here is very new and high-end, and you can even choose the temperature.

### Day 5 (11/16 Saturday) Writing at San'enkyōji Temple, Himeji Castle, Shopping Around Himeji

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*EqvQAU91nnYsl8w7vT7CTg.png)

Every Toyoko INN offers free breakfast, but I usually just grab some convenience store bread and coffee I bought the night before to save time in the morning.

#### 08:45 Leave the house

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*HIa6B4yuh-MjFWMeBs97IQ.jpeg)

At 8:45 AM, left the hotel and crossed the deserted shopping street to the station.

#### 08:55 Take the bus to Shoshu-san Enkyo-ji Temple

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Z3_zOdcbly3jEyXyN8RKWA.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*3KNztIIzy_Yw85kEm5ai-Q.jpeg)

Himeji Station has several platforms. Google Maps does not specify which platform or bus number to take, so you need to follow the signs on site. Take bus number 10 from platform 10, the 日 姫路駅北〜書写山ロープウェイ route.

> *Shosan-en Temple was a filming location for the movie The Last Samurai:*

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*d-BdwUp1HRFSSl_Zu16cDQ.jpeg)

After getting off, you will find the cable car boarding area. After buying a round-trip ticket at the ticket machine, you can line up to wait for the cable car. (Runs every 15 minutes)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Q96ZZxOE04V57QXJcsL2iA.jpeg)

Shosaku Mountain will have special night openings from 11/15 to 11/17, open until 8:00 PM, and the cable car hours are extended to 8:30 PM.

#### 09:30 Take the cable car up the mountain

#### 09:35 Arrive at the entrance of Shoshu-san Enkyoji Temple

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*4AYY1gP1Kdb589JwBHaFuw.png)

Tickets are required for entry. At that time, I didn't check carefully and only bought the **regular mountain entry fee, which does not include round-trip shuttle service, so you have to walk up the mountain**. ⚠️⚠️⚠️

> *About a 5-minute drive*

> *Hiking time: about 20 minutes (1 KM)*

> ***If I had to choose again, I would pay an extra 500 yen to save time and energy.***

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*ewt3SGQwn6WyhRV7Am0_MA.jpeg)

Fortunately, it was early in the morning, so I still had plenty of energy and spirit. The slope was gentle, so I walked up the mountain while enjoying the autumn leaves.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*5nc-fnNgZHhIwlJhTcYKjg.png)

Shoshan Enkyoji Temple covers a vast area; I think it takes at least 2 hours to walk through the entire site.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*U4wMNwdurbeaNEOqUKkC9Q.png)

I only visited the Mani Hall and the Great Lecture Hall before turning back down the mountain.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*IyDpkfR-0QmrIiNwGg0aJA.jpeg)

You can take off your shoes and enter the Mani Hall to pray, and you can also view the maple leaves from here.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*BbDp9dGeoep-40MgJeDiOQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*fImTadRZFNlut58qayxvhQ.jpeg)

It is very quiet and peaceful, but this year's maple leaves turned red later, with only a few scattered trees changing color.

Walk forward from the rear alley toward the main auditorium.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*hsCWaBEKnGp5QMX_YaF4Gw.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*0yUCPUF_oEy4manAS8kJ0A.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*gjTjoLDLZC6EeAP3Gcnbdw.png)

The lecture hall features an installation art piece by [Engyō-ji Temple x Kengo Kuma](https://x.com/kugikumo){:target="_blank"}, on display until 12/1.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*4m561KwGCbbgXnrrYERkJw.jpeg)

The maple leaves next to the lecture hall are very red.

> *When I arrived at the main hall, a sutra chanting was in progress. Visitors can take off their shoes and enter to pay respects. The Japanese monks chant differently from those in Taiwan; they unfold the entire scripture, chant along, then fold it back and clap at the end.*

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*V_0ogPmKoPiQ9-nuUfxvlw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*NKB_Hzykps-3rC3HHrxHIg.jpeg)

You can also visit the nearby canteen, which displays many historical artifacts.

All the buildings are historical monuments (built in 1282). Walking on them gives a sense of traveling through history, and the overall architecture is well preserved and maintained.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*T4ybcdOD3Fr9qJPRvKyjvA.jpeg)

View of the main auditorium from the second floor of the cafeteria.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*kwc7TD6kOkAMUEGCyQZyHw.jpeg)

After visiting the main auditorium, I returned to the Mani Hall and bought a freshly baked red bean mochi at the shop outside to recharge. (Freshly baked and delicious, with a crispy skin)

![Have a safe trip home.](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*3vuyM_hvr2vqmMigtjrJfQ.jpeg)

Have a safe trip home.

After eating, spend another 20 minutes walking downhill back to the entrance of Shina Lodge.

#### ~=10:55 Take the cable car down the mountain

The bus stop when walking back down the mountain, around 11:05, waiting for the 11:10 bus back to Himeji city center.

#### ~= 11:35 Arrive at Himeji Castle

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*kxFG8jVc9-4cfH5uTVpbsQ.jpeg)

After getting off the bus, walk a little forward to reach the Himeji Castle boat tour. However, the weather was gloomy and it looked like rain, so I didn't go.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*ReisZ-PRti3sK13ozeceDA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*OwoTR1-C35HhJiv-rq8o2w.jpeg)

Walking into Himeji Castle, the bridge scenery at the entrance is great for photos!

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*KmgaWgD9UXFA3R6UGw8QoQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*NISOgxwwrowWgi9jHz_qWw.jpeg)

The Sannomaru Plaza in front of Himeji Castle is very large. From here, it takes another 5 minutes to reach the castle entrance.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*TczWjw__6r_H15vgUwkcUQ.png)

I decided to first visit the Himeji Castle photo spot recommended by a passerby yesterday. The spot is in the opposite direction of the castle entrance, inside the "Himeji City Zoo" on the right side.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*NAGnOqG4plLpo1AVEtwCgg.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*UzJF2eGGGmIhgK_a3xANAA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*GmIPAY57WWuEBRXl6tmcBw.jpeg)

According to the promotion, there is a capybara on the right side, but it might not be out due to the cold. After entering, go straight across the bridge, turn right after seeing the Ferris wheel, and behind it, there is an open space which is the photo spot.

![<https://youtube.com/shorts/XDquPOanhpQ>{:target="_blank"}](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Rupw705abK9nx8m8x0MPdw.jpeg)

<https://youtube.com/shorts/XDquPOanhpQ>{:target="_blank"}

The shooting spot has a great view, but unfortunately, there are no cherry blossoms or maple leaves to complement it.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*xUkRrlHFLbKJWKjnVAw59A.jpeg)

> *After filming, I walked around the zoo a bit. The facilities are very old (amusement rides cost extra), animal spaces are cramped, **many animals look depressed and display stereotypic behaviors, hard to watch**, so I left shortly after.*

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*KEQvJI90xEVXc4r4GQ0wew.jpeg)

After filming Himeji Castle, walk back to the left-side entrance to visit inside the castle.

After buying the ticket, follow the tour route straight into the city.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*6NcZZitF85yrZIt8J6kSmw.png)

After entering indoors, you also need to take off your shoes. A plastic bag will be provided to store them.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*dRqPqCQhSezJ5wsttSJeVg.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*zl-BV1uAW_u3qxG-KR4wLQ.jpeg)

Looking back at Himeji Station from the second floor, there are six floors in total. The higher you go, the smaller the floors and the steeper the stairs, requiring you to queue to go up.

> *It was almost 12:30 PM, and I was very hungry. I also forgot to bring a power bank today, so my phone was nearly out of battery. Seeing the long line of people waiting, I decided not to keep climbing and turned back at the second level to leave the city.*

[Kushiyaki Kobe beef](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3ANcmi6uR1wnDgqYA){:target="_blank"}

Outside Himeji Castle, I found a shop selling Kobe beef in the shopping street. I took away Kobe beef rice bowl and skewers to the hotel to rest and recharge.

#### 13:20 Return to hotel to rest

Bad weather + morning hike + dead phone = back to the hotel to rest.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Sp_2bL6TiDs-FTIT1hf4cg.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*0BxN4BJO9GZ3jCHQr7_qpg.jpeg)

Except for the portion being a bit small, the Kobe beef here tastes quite good.

#### 15:30 Shopping near Himeji Station

Rested until about 15:30 and went out again.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*1yvJy0uUoWXpna40MC5ZTg.jpeg)

There isn't much to shop around Himeji Station. There are only the Piole mall at the station, the department store in the SANYO Electric Railway building, and a nearby shopping street. There is no Don Quijote or McDonald's, only one Lawson, and just one Matsumoto Kiyoshi drugstore.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*EtwTImtOX4SlPrRo6CKBYg.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*H_cAfQPJP8QXU_7MPgzYyA.jpeg)

On the third floor of Piole, Kiddy Land has some GiiKawa figures. There aren’t many people here, so no need to queue. I took three babies home, but couldn’t get the Usagi pajamas version QQ.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*9u7HGC1YdSWWcS_1_iqMzw.png)

It started raining heavily near evening. Fortunately, there were no special plans scheduled for today.

Chose a random shop in the shopping street that serves Kobe beef for dinner.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*5Cc0K6Xd5p0FMJbxhB4gOg.jpeg)

The highlight here is an appetizer shaped like a lucky cat and a dessert that isn’t too sweet, which is quite good.

Ordered Kobe beef steak, ochazuke, and draft beer.

The Kobe beef here was just average, a bit tough to chew, and lacked the distinct Kobe beef flavor. However, the ochazuke (tea poured over rice) was quite tasty.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*q_ek8sUX3nM5xCBTPkXa6Q.jpeg)

After eating, take a casual stroll around Himeji after the rain.

#### ~=20:00 Return to the hotel to rest & watch the Taiwan-Japan game

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*oBZH4_-Pb7difuUCdwvSBw.jpeg)

From a Japanese perspective, the broadcast content is completely incomprehensible, but the Japanese broadcast provides very detailed information. On the left, there is additional baseball knowledge, and on the right, a full analysis of the pitch types.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*4wJ-WWxbgYAeGgcf-KPtyQ.jpeg)

The final match was won by Japan.

> *Good night, Himeji.*

### Day 6 (11/17 Sunday) Osaka, Kobe

Originally planned to visit Naruto Whirlpools and Akashi Kaikyō Bridge, but due to bad weather, we changed to shopping in Osaka and Kobe.

#### ~= 08:45 Take the Shinkansen non-reserved seat to Shin-Osaka

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*T5blo2Kdt0KsYaItd6H5dA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*RvSje4c8thVxGXJpBZwnTA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*gGkwpzey7E9tlg0gbbV35g.jpeg)

Taking the Shinkansen to Shin-Osaka (25 minutes) and then transferring to the Midosuji Line to Osaka takes about the same time as taking a regular train directly to Osaka. Since there are many Shinkansen departures, I chose the more comfortable Shinkansen where I can also charge my devices.

#### 9:17 Arrive at Shin-Osaka

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*apUd_VYqJJ_mM_Kr_R3YnQ.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*6ptZt3XbRNnIK1Ph62j9eg.jpeg)

After arriving at Shin-Osaka, you still need to walk to the Midosuji Line.

First, visit [Namba Yasaka Shrine](../76d66c2e34af/) in Kansai, which was missed last year.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*vWqBuGY0nf4NQY1pw5Pb7w.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*uCKGMuqTmPVL61gvJU_AKg.jpeg)

After getting off at Namba Station, walk a short distance and the shrine is located in an alley.

> *Just realized Osaka is also testing facial recognition for station entry and exit.*

#### ~=9:50 Arrive at Namba Yasaka Shrine

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*eENL5QrW5I0g_Bb3Iqlc6Q.png)

The shrine is small and crowded with tourists. People usually just take a few photos and leave.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*1YnEjMoc8KV-OaV08XrMcA.jpeg)

After leaving, continue to the next station "Daikokucho," take one stop to "Dobutsuen-mae," and get off to head to Tsutenkaku.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*bxBxGhqonhPE-kNU7jl5DA.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*_ZGMWno1bnS5VIsevjVuGw.jpeg)

Exit the station, pass through the underground passage and shopping street, then continue straight to see Tsutenkaku Tower.

> *The security here feels quite chaotic. Right after exiting the station and passing through the underpass, there are many homeless people, and some are arguing loudly, which is a bit scary.*

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*WOzCL0xA6hirl6Ru3iYxlg.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*xWz0KkdvI5042L31ritmjw.png)

The shopping street alley is narrow with food on both sides. A few places seem to be popular spots with long lines and many people.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*GiVI9kQjjJLKp5E0BYq__Q.png)

Around 10:30, I arrived at the base of Tsutenkaku. There was a long queue of people waiting to go up, so I gave up immediately.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*oRVH7x_G3Ga19FD04YQCIg.jpeg)

Walk back to the subway station to return to Osaka.

#### ~=11:00 Return to Osaka Umeda

On the 13th floor, there is a Pokémon Center, Nintendo Osaka, CAPCOM…

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*EJivBHlcWiG1tgWQoVQWQQ.jpeg)

Checked out some Zelda merchandise, [already bought a lot last time](../76d66c2e34af/), so this time I left without buying anything.

Passing by the Hanshin Tigers merchandise store.

Getting ready to eat at Shake Shack. I had it in Bangkok in July and still crave it [Unforgettable](https://medium.com/ztravel/%E9%81%8A%E8%A8%98-2024-%E6%B3%B0%E5%9C%8B%E6%9B%BC%E8%B0%B7-bangkok-5-%E6%97%A5%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E8%A1%8C-b7e7c0938985?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------){:target="_blank"}; now enjoying it again in Osaka.

Ordered through self-service; this time had the avocado bacon chicken burger and a milkshake. The place is quite spacious with plenty of seating.

After eating, I wandered around near Osaka Station and decided to visit Osaka's Kiddy Land to look for Jiji Kawa.

Got lost in Osaka underground shopping street, walked for a long time before finding Hankyu Sanbangai. Then took the underground passage from the South Building to the North Building, and the food court is right above.

There are quite a few people in line, and it’s estimated that the wait will be at least 40 minutes.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*ipoT-8QkWmfXhInjaK3Q2w.jpeg)

It might be because of the holiday, but there are more events. Outside Kiddy Land, there is also a Kanahei photo event. (Another Usagi XD)

#### 13:20 Head to Kobe

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*iuobD0lpLgt6UCJ8Wqk3ag.png)

Got a bit lost in the underground mall before finally finding Osaka Umeda subway station. Took the Hankyu Kobe Line to Kobe Sannomiya (Hankyu).

#### 13:50 Arrive at Kobe

It's still early, so I plan to go to [Kobe Animal Kingdom](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fspZDr7MyGMpT24r6){:target="_blank"} to see the capybaras first.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*L_861E8BgHXpjDqG7B-ExA.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*wkKdFGjiN_C6aGWTNSNxXA.jpeg)

Google Map asked me to take the "New Transit Harbor Artificial Island Line," but I wandered around the underground mall for a long time and couldn't find the corresponding signs. (Lost Day)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*OAOZe3cdGLU6r_6Nv2QEww.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Rx_UFhPm-pM6Nxn2DTKx6w.jpeg)

I only realized after exiting that this is the one flying in the sky, entering from the second floor of Sangu Station.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*yWTsJjuy_Xn01e9Lus8YOw.png)

The station was crowded, and I later found out that today happened to be the [Kobe Marathon](https://zh-tw.kobe-marathon.net/2024/global/){:target="_blank"}.

Lost Day… Because the bus arrived just then and I didn’t look carefully, I got on the wrong bus heading to the North Pier. The tragedy started from that moment.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*sURfSLVO2IkE2QPTq3zm7g.png)

> ***To go to Kobe Animal Kingdom, take the route toward Kobe Airport. The route toward North Wharf will turn back at North Wharf and return to Kobe.*** *⚠️⚠️⚠️*

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*z8eEqxV_DQKM1FGLRxRU7A.png)

Kobe Marathon has road closures and runs on the elevated highway. This subway line, like Taipei Metro's Wenhu Line, is an early rubber-tired metro.

#### 14:20 Realized I was on the wrong bus, got off at Zhongbutou

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*IGsTOnGQ2wiFBthumdIybw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*_BOkMH5_0AnTJcaZCtwUtg.jpeg)

I sensed something was off here and got off immediately. Google Maps suggested I walk back to Civic Plaza Station to catch the next train.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*wCBuXOfGc6fSMVTM1MLZ_w.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*g8uGboUzgjpperWLcaCe-A.jpeg)

It might be because this is a reclaimed port area, which feels very desolate and the walk seems long.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*ZyXQTkEYvXAbIv0TVUgCzQ.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*5ZyBkEGQ_NiYON5ofd9faw.png)

Walking quickly to the Civic Square Station, I wondered why it was so lively. It turned out to be the finish line event venue for the Kobe Marathon.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*ULve9yF_dxl_KN_wjREO0g.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*HoUGLVRBxl2s45E40BMLGQ.jpeg)

Walked to South Park Station, just one more stop to go, but too lazy to take the subway, so I walked straight to Kobe Animal Kingdom…

As mentioned before, it feels very remote and indeed is far. Walking from the central pier is 2 kilometers (about 30 minutes).

#### 14:50 Arrive at Kobe Animal Kingdom

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*HzgFgMtmQ3Sw6piVC4Mblg.png)

Ticket price: 2,200 yen

Shoebill, Masked Palm Civet, Red Panda

Although Kobe Animal Kingdom is partly indoors and partly outdoors, its layout is well planned. It has various birds and animals, most of which can be approached closely. It's great for families to spend half a day here. The animals are in much better condition compared to Himeji City Zoo, and the environment is very clean.

#### Capybara

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*XtvMffuoulVGOt0AK88BbQ.jpeg)

The purpose of coming here is achieved: to touch the capybara. It's so fat, and its fur feels rough like a broom.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*AoazZpBcYuh-LpiZLCk6fw.jpeg)

Each one looks so lazy; not having to work is great!

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Dui-4l3rOZkGVjVuEAjqZw.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*a0JZ_DEQph3dAI-Mlzhxvw.jpeg)

Possibly due to being overweight, food is no longer sold for feeding inside the venue, and feeding outside food or placing items on its head is prohibited.

In another area, you can interact closely with kangaroos and sheep.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*D4K3htSuQ7vwCDGqizRLrg.jpeg)

Remember to wash your hands before and after touching.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*A540bEA8Z1WvYv2BZZB6XQ.jpeg)

There is also a seal, but the space looks too small, so it keeps swimming in circles QQ

Indoors, there is also an interactive area with rabbits, cats, and dogs (tickets required), as well as food and souvenir shops, and more.

Overall, the experience was quite good!

#### 15:50 Leave, prepare to return to Kobe

Mainly came to see the capybaras, and didn't stay long due to limited time.

There is still over an hour before mealtime, so first, I’ll stroll around near Kobe Sannomiya, looking for capsule toys and Kiddy Land as usual.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*LAu0vz0PiOzK3QC8xQbeJg.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*eDM9G1Lrm5nQLnusWKD7uA.jpeg)

Kobe's Kiddy Land had few people, but there were very few Gudetama products, and I couldn't find the Usagi pajamas I wanted.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Cmt7wQ4UV4cYAaTNzxvgHA.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*q7C947BYHvNxBDhPSGG6uQ.png)

Go to the second floor to look for capsule toys and check the secondhand store to see if they have the Usagi I want.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*AF8Ium09DuuXVdb6wgirtQ.jpeg)

B1 has a Kobe Beef restaurant called Kichijoji. We arrived for dinner almost at 5 PM.

It was still early, and there were few people; the owner was very enthusiastic when he heard I was from Taiwan. This meal was also the purpose of coming to Kobe: **to have a good meal — Kobe beef**, since I had been eating randomly for the past few days.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*TplkGy7shiHlWAHyLf9-KQ.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*0ufGhslTqU6l0UUlsFCOCg.png)

I ordered the "Kobe Lean Beef Steak 220g" for 7,700 yen (pre-tax ⚠️, tax included at checkout), with a set meal (lettuce, rice, soup) and draft beer.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*794jNjGugkDnsJOPEdOJZw.jpeg)

The lettuce is fresh and crisp, and the soup is beef broth, very tasty.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*MUe5xLDpu4wLU2OCnrddTw.jpeg)

The meat is tender, juicy, and flavorful. Compared to the Kobe beef I had yesterday, this is the true taste of Kobe beef.

> *But to be honest, I still prefer teppan dishes over Western-style food.*

Final actual charge: `$2,158 TWD`.

#### 17:40 Finished eating and left, heading to Kobe Tower

After eating, walk to the old foreign settlement along the coastline and Daimaru-mae Station. Take one stop and then walk to Kobe Tower.

Kobe is very lively (compared to Himeji) with many department stores to shop at.

Take the train toward Shin-Nagata and get off at the next stop, Minato Motomachi.

Kobe Port has a strong harbor town vibe. If I get the chance, I would consider staying overnight in Kobe.

This time, I just took a quick look around and left.

#### 18:30 Return to Kobe Chinatown

On the way back to Kobe Station, first stop by Chinatown to buy [Kobe Frantz chocolate souvenirs](https://frantz.co.jp/en/){:target="_blank"}.

#### 09:13 Arrive at Okayama Station

It takes about 21 minutes by Shinkansen to reach Okayama Station. Unfortunately, there isn't enough time this trip to [visit Hiroshima again](https://medium.com/ztravel/%E9%81%8A%E8%A8%98-2023-%E5%BB%A3%E5%B3%B6%E5%B2%A1%E5%B1%B1-6-%E6%97%A5%E9%81%8A-31b9b3a63abc?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*PgFJG7RNh8w5f4pK5Dv6Eg.jpeg)

Same as last time, go directly to the west exit of Okayama Station to catch the airport bus. There are lockers here to store luggage and restrooms (at this time, the department stores are not open and there are few restrooms available).

#### 09:30 McDonald's at Okayama Station to try the "Waffle Burger" that has been very popular in Taiwan recently

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*1O8uNrClegWyQoAJE12e5g.png)

I almost chose the wrong item because I couldn't read Japanese. You need to pick this one, "マックグリドル," to get the pancake series.

This place is very spacious and great for shopping, with almost all brands available.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*vjssm5svEoPfePGcNgElCg.jpeg)

There are places to eat and buy souvenirs (B1-B2) as well.

Keep looking for capsule toys, but I couldn't find the train button capsule toy I wanted, so I gave up... It’s probably no longer available.

Some stores also sell Jiikawa.

#### ~=11:00 Getting ready for lunch

> ***Not very hungry, but to prepare for the afternoon wait at the airport and since Tigerair doesn't provide meals, I still have to eat.*** *⚠️⚠️⚠️*

[**Pork Steak Specialty Shop B Okayama Branch**](https://tabelog.com/okayama/A3301/A330101/33018608/){:target="_blank"}

Chose a restaurant specializing in teppan pork chops.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*-8Sx-7tZ5l-DPua6GOunTA.jpeg)

Ordered a 200g pork steak set meal and a draft beer. The total was `2,178 yen`.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*rT1vHotHA_BsYMp5BFadUQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*weW08CNKF-sFY48mz-Qw7g.jpeg)

Surprisingly, the pork cutlet was served medium rare, about 70% cooked; after checking reviews and descriptions, it seems this is their specialty. However, I still used the hot iron plate to cook the pieces that could be cooked further.

> *It really tastes delicious, very juicy, full of meaty aroma, and not tough to chew; personally, I think it's as good as yesterday's Kobe beef (I might just not be lucky with wealth).*

Small useless suitcase (about the same size as AirPods Pro) and kid's bag

Finally, I bought some items at MUJI on the first floor and left around 12:15.

#### ~=12:30 Return to Okayama Station

Preparing to take the 1:00 PM shuttle to Gangshan Airport.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*g0faLCzFGCjUq6xndxPXCA.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*wp34SWl53PM47RyotD7_7A.jpeg)

One last look at Okayama.

#### ~=13:00 Take the shuttle bus to Gangshan Airport

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*WQPyQGy5C0nZLfJ-3GIZcA.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*YD-OAt75d1s69u6qZpWrsw.png)

At Platform 21, queue up to wait for the bus. Don't worry about missing the ride; anyone who queues before 13:00 will be taken to the airport (additional shuttle buses will be added if full).

You can directly tap your transportation card (Suica) when boarding and alighting, or you can buy a ticket by inserting coins inside the bus shelter.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*wZz-iSrK6orko9_30h31gw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*2Ey3Ma7iGU0aZcvM-5-KuA.jpeg)

The bus departed early at 12:45 due to full capacity.

#### ~=13:20 Arrive at Okayama Momotaro Airport

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*7gnnl4V4uwpVHg9wq9sliw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Zev8bJycwEj6HruuaPqWyA.jpeg)

The time is still very early. This year, I took the 17:30 flight, while last year I took the 15:25 flight, which was just right. Now, for the 17:30 flight, I have to wait almost 4 hours.

![<https://www.okayama-airport.org/tw/access/bus>{:target="_blank"}](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*EL5tuKai1e95lToFw7agNQ.png)

<https://www.okayama-airport.org/tw/access/bus>{:target="_blank"}

> *But currently it's not possible because **the next bus is at 15:55, arriving at the airport at 16:25**; although the airport is small and there is only one outbound flight at the same time, which is quite fast, traffic jams and other factors make it hard to guarantee arrival by 16:25. For example, when I came, I encountered traffic jams that added almost 30 minutes to the trip.*

> *It depends on whether Okayama Airport increases shuttle bus services, or you can go to the [**Japan Free Travel Discussion Group**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/207266832755595){:target="_blank"} to find people to share a taxi.*

> *Others shared that a taxi from Okayama Station to the airport costs about 7,000 yen.*

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*WloJT1lwu9sE7K1YY2Lmfg.jpeg)

Wandering around near the airport, there is a miniature version of Okayama Korakuen Garden outside the airport, along with popular maple leaves.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*OO1rTCEh9kw5aQMfaPk_wQ.jpeg)

Outside the station, there is also a statue of Momotaro. Additionally, the airport kindly reminds you to buy insurance. **This time, I really almost got hit by a bicycle. ⚠️**

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*JZnvFBhhDjBVHdeEqPDYHw.jpeg)

There are quite a few seats available here for resting.

The first floor only has a souvenir shop, nothing else. [Just like last year](../31b9b3a63abc/), I bought a peach mochi to eat.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*1vlNWZvaNY8I47Qydyd9cw.jpeg)

The second floor is under renovation, with only a few shops open. The observation deck that was accessible last year ([link](../31b9b3a63abc/)) also seems to be closed. However, there is still a souvenir shop and several food outlets available.

#### ~=15:00 Begin check-in procedures

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*lGDYdJexHQY6XkiyPZJOhw.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*1oLSBw-IwqMJh4-RA81Apg.png)

Momotaro Airport is too small, so the check-in and baggage drop-off process is different from other airports.

> ***This is the unified queue. Checked luggage goes through X-ray and receives a sealing sticker; carry-on luggage does not (security checks before departure will scan other items). Even without checked luggage, you must join the queue.*** *When it's your turn, inform the airport staff that you have no checked luggage and proceed directly. If you open your suitcase after the sticker is applied, it must be rescanned and restickered. ⚠️⚠️⚠️*

> *The airport staff can speak Chinese... very impressive*

#### ~=15:15 Check-in and baggage drop completed

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*k2WrB1ooYpRa8zSD8A2Dlw.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*MNH21H-7oPaOq-GP_uKUpA.png)

This time, I didn’t buy much or any alcohol, yet it still weighed 17 kg... but I barely had any carry-on luggage; everything was packed inside.

#### ~=16:20 Start security check and immigration clearance queue

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*Wjgk2cV8hkiBkIjxjke6AA.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*iezQ2KMlAUzJrKjqlHzyLw.jpeg)

The airport is under renovation... but there are still capsule toys available.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*di7LhsC-MYyRIVwYRWVU-Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*AHTIPdSzU7TJrq1hVeKACg.png)

Although there was only one flight, because the airport is small, has few staff, only one line, and thorough checks, the security screening and departure process took about 20–30 minutes.

The place for pouring water and discarding items is just a box.

> *It feels like if you rush to leave Okayama at 15:55 and catch the shuttle to the airport at 16:25, as long as you arrive on time, the check-in and baggage drop counters should be empty and you can handle them directly. Then you can go straight to the departure security check and still make it in time.*

> *We are the only flight on this route, so the plane will likely depart only after all checked-in passengers complete security. Arriving early at the airport doesn't mean you'll get through security faster if you queue late.*

#### ~=16:42 Start waiting for the flight

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*dZLP9y156IaL2ZYxefWyAQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*vb73mCN99CDryoSCqdo_Dw.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*0-fhLcrfopTMrx9rvE0nYg.png)

The waiting lounge is small, with only one duty-free shop selling a limited selection of souvenirs, tobacco, and alcohol.

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*SAM-saIjWrap5wL4dAxENQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*QCxhYYWHW2RLvZsTgWQ0Sw.jpeg)

I wanted to buy a few cans of peach water to bring back to Taiwan, but they were all sold out; so I bought a can of Kōcha Kaden instead. After trying it, I found it very tasty and not too sweet. I regret not buying more.

#### ~=18:10 Departure (40 minutes delay)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*f3Yqp6letQnKZI8spjNn-Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*PSlGa7hB3SwG6zFHnEVFLQ.jpeg)

> ***Goodbye Okayama, goodbye Japan.***

Sitting next to me on the plane was a Youtuber, a friendly guy from [**Follow us and Chill with us**](https://www.youtube.com/@lw.chill2022){:target="_blank"}. He was going to Shikoku this time, and we exchanged some sightseeing recommendations. I hope to visit Shikoku someday too.

#### 19:45 Arrive in Taiwan (10-minute delay)

Luckily, it only affected 10 minutes. Quickly picked up the luggage and rushed to the bus station.

#### 20:20 Take the Daya Bus to Taipei

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*EDhpsb6FiVOOwKoDslj3nA.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*63kNa-lLfoQ6uKfjEy9BVw.png)

![](/assets/aacd5f5cacd1/1*uRb-Shzk65f1cuiiBxd6SQ.jpeg)

Depending on the location, you can take different buses home. Previously, I took the Kuokuang bus directly to Taipei. This time, I will take the Dayou Bus from platform 11 back to New Taipei.

> *Coincidentally, the EasyCard balance was insufficient, so I hurried to the counter to buy a ticket with cash (luckily, I had brought New Taiwan dollars the day before), and finally caught the bus.*

#### End of the journey.

### Summary of Thoughts

This trip was too packed, and we only had a brief look at many places. Especially during the first three days, due to long travel distances and short stays, we couldn’t fully enjoy the beautiful scenery of Izumo and Matsue in Shimane. If given the chance, I would like to visit again to watch the sunset, see the autumn leaves, and experience the Kamiari Festival.

If you want to learn about history before visiting Izumo, you can refer to Papa Lan's videos:
