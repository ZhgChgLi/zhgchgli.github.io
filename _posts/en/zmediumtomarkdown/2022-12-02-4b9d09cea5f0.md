Pinkoi products support four platforms: desktop, mobile, iOS, and Android, as well as six languages: Traditional Chinese, Hong Kong Traditional, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Thai, and English.

Behind the scenes, there are 8+ squads responsible for different aspects of work, such as the Buyer Squad for the buyer side, Seller Squad for the seller side, Platform Squad for the backend, AI Squad for algorithms, etc., all working together to create Pinkoi products.

Please note: This image is not comprehensive or up-to-date regarding the Tech Stack.

To do a good job, one must first sharpen their tools. The above image lists the Tech Stack and tools used by the Pinkoi development team; it also includes cross-team collaboration tools such as Slack, Asana, Figma, and other services.


As the team size continues to grow, there will be more instances requiring communication or repetitive tasks. At this point, introducing tools and services can effectively strengthen the connections between people and enhance team efficiency.

Although engineers at Pinkoi are assigned to various Squad Teams, they still work together with a shared purpose, **Win as a team, we are still one family**.

Colleagues in the same function (e.g., iOS/Android/BE/FE/Data…) not only hold regular technical exchange sessions but also engage in Code Reviews and System Design discussions during daily development; discussing together and growing together!

#### **How do Engineers help advance business goals?**

![](/assets/4b9d09cea5f0/1*PL7MVwYZaDIepnluRTnuew.png)

In addition to completing tasks, engineers have many ways to help advance business goals:

First, setting aside the constraints of the engineer role and starting from personal experience; during the project planning phase, we can share our own usage experiences and various creative ideas. For example, by observing friends' usage habits or new trendy cool things (e.g., iOS 16 Dynamic Island), brainstorming together might turn an otherwise ordinary feature into a new highlight!

Returning to engineering itself, the first requirement is of course essential development skills. Good development capabilities can maintain scalability and stability, reduce technical debt, and lower future maintenance costs, thereby enhancing business value. Similarly, making the right technical choices can maximize value with limited development resources; all of this requires a lot of hard skills and accumulated experience.

Moreover, leveraging communication and coordination skills can make cross-engineering discussions more efficient, while collaboration skills can reduce redundancy; both can significantly increase team output and further advance business goals.

In summary, engineers definitely do not only create value through coding.

At Pinkoi, the Sync-up or project discussion meetings of the squad teams involve not only engineers but also designers, PMs, and analysts, all participating in project discussions; everyone can share their ideas, sparking different insights.
#### **As an Engineer, why choose to join a startup culture rather than a traditional large company...?**

![](/assets/4b9d09cea5f0/1*9exlQqvnQi1wmDzYIsejZQ.png)

From personal experience, the startup culture (also at Pinkoi) has five characteristics:
- **Transparency**  
Everyone can clearly understand the company's operational status, decision-making, and future plans.
- **Equality**  
Flat management structure, with no hierarchical pressure. Everyone can express opinions and participate in discussions, regardless of position.
- **Vision**  
Growing together with the team, from small teams to international teams, broadening perspectives. Combining transparency and equality allows for a deeper understanding of various aspects.
- **Flexibility**  
  - Work flexibility: There is much room for discussion regarding work hours, WFH flexibility, and communication and collaboration.
  - Job flexibility: More opportunities to try different possibilities and more flexibility in promotions.
- **Vibrancy**  
With a relatively young average age, there is more energy, making it easier to resonate and spark ideas, as well as to drive and accept change.

These characteristics are often harder to find in traditional large companies, which tend to be more closed and uniform, making it difficult to propose ideas. The visibility of what can be seen and done is also limited, and there is often resistance to new changes. This can make it relatively difficult for energetic newcomers to thrive.
#### **A piece of advice for newcomers aspiring to be software engineers...**

Engineer at 28 vs. Engineer at 46 (Elon Musk was also once an engineer); although it's a meme, it conveys that the kind of engineer you want to become is entirely up to you.

In addition to lean development skills, I believe the mindset is even more important. Life is a journey with many stages and roles to fulfill. The first is to constantly step out of your comfort zone and be prepared to face greater challenges. For instance, I started as a backend engineer, then transitioned to iOS development, and now I'm taking on management roles.

The second is the exploration of direction. Don't limit yourself; everyone has infinite possibilities and can continuously adjust to find the direction that suits them, shining in their areas of expertise. We have teammates who transitioned to engineering later or moved from design to PM. Additionally, consider what roles you want to take on at 30 or 40 years old, such as continuing to delve into technology to become an architect/Tech Lead or shifting to a management position.

Lifelong learning is also crucial. Learning is endless, especially in the information industry, which is ever-changing. Without a pursuit of innovation and change, it’s easy to be eliminated from the industry.

Lastly, it’s very important to maintain a balance between work and life. Work Hard, Play Hard not only enhances work efficiency but also allows you to draw inspiration from life experiences. As mentioned earlier, sometimes a small idea can change the world and create greater business value!

I advise newcomers to **choose carefully** their first few jobs. The cost of silence is very low when you first enter society. You should prioritize jobs where you can learn something, and try to join companies that have products (e.g., [Pinkoi](https://www.pinkoi.com/about/careers){:target="_blank"} /Line/StreetVoice…). Avoid changing jobs too frequently (at least stay for a year), as it will be very beneficial for your future career.

> The road of life is still long; I hope everyone finds their own path. Thank you.
