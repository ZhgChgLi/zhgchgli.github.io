### The Secrets of an Efficient Engineering Team

2021/09/08 19:00 @ [Pinkoi x Yourator](https://www.accupass.com/event/2108230716001792899747){:target="_blank"}

### About the Team

**Pinkoi's work style consists of multiple Squads:**
- Buyer-Squad: Focuses on buyer-side features
- Seller-Squad: Focuses on designer-side features
- Exploring-Squad: Focuses on browsing and exploration
- Ad-Squad: Focuses on platform advertising
- Out-Of-Squad: Primarily provides support, infrastructure, or process optimization


Each Squad is composed of team members from various functions, including PM, Product Designer, Data, Frontend, Backend, iOS, Android, etc.; long-term and ongoing work objectives are completed by the Squad.

In addition to Squads, there are also cross-team projects that typically have medium to short-term work objectives, which can be led by any team member as Project Owner. Once the tasks are completed, the project is closed.


> _At the end of the document, there is a section on **how Pinkoi's culture supports teammates in problem-solving**. If **you are not interested in the actual content, feel free to scroll to the bottom to view this section**._ 




### The Relationship Between Team Size and Efficiency


![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*V7jEnBoR5XpRsPM-WF8GdA.png)


The relationship between team size growth and work efficiency has been observed from startups with 10 people to teams of hundreds (though we haven't yet faced the challenge of thousands). However, the leap from 10 to 100 is significant in many aspects.

With fewer people, communication and task handling are quick; discussions can happen in person, and solutions can be provided immediately. This is because the "connections between people" are quite strong, allowing for synchronized collaboration.

However, in larger teams, direct communication becomes challenging. As more people collaborate, discussions can consume an entire morning; additionally, many team members are involved in collaboration, necessitating prioritization of tasks. Non-urgent matters cannot be addressed immediately, leading to asynchronous waiting while other tasks are completed.


![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*nkSy-H-33Jdtf10fISwqrw.png)


The addition of more roles allows for more detailed and specialized work division, providing greater capacity or better quality and faster output.

However, as mentioned at the beginning, this also means more collaboration, which in turn requires more communication time.

Small issues can be magnified; for example, if one person spends 10 minutes daily on reporting, that’s manageable. But if this scales to 20 people, it results in over 3 additional hours spent daily on reporting. At this point, optimizing and automating the reporting process becomes highly valuable, saving 3 hours daily, which translates to 750 hours wasted over 250 working days in a year.


![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*S-OXkos4LdViqlTtgP-DXg.png)


As team size grows, for the App Team, there are several roles that collaborate closely.

Backend — API, Product Designer — UI, which is self-explanatory. Pinkoi is an international product, so the Localization Team assists us with translations for functional text. Additionally, we have a Data Team that conducts data collection and analysis, so besides developing features, we also need to discuss event embedding points with the Data Team.


Customer Service is also a team that frequently interacts with us. Besides users sometimes directly reflecting order issues through mall reviews, more often, users leave a one-star rating saying they encountered a problem. At this point, we need to ask the customer service team for help in conducting a deeper inquiry: What problem did they encounter? How can we assist you?

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*smgTFSo4jQFcbiOfiH42hQ.png)

With so many collaborative relationships, it means there are many communication opportunities.

> **_But remember, we are not avoiding or trying to minimize communication; excellent communication skills are also very important for engineers._**

What we need to focus on is important communication, such as brainstorming, discussing requirements, and timelines; we should not waste time on confirming repetitive issues or engaging in vague communication. Avoid situations where you ask me, and I ask you about their circumstances.

Especially in the pandemic era, communication time is precious and should be spent on more valuable discussions.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*ksnbNTYxBX4ou90D2WmmdA.png)

"I thought you thought I thought" — this phrase perfectly illustrates the consequences of vague communication.

It's not just in work; we often encounter misunderstandings in daily life due to differing perceptions. In daily life, ease and comfort rely on mutual understanding; however, in work, differing perceptions without in-depth discussion can easily lead to discovering discrepancies only at the production stage.

### Interface Communication

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*AUPvV8j9-AWyHor-Ig_jiA.png)

The idea introduced here is to communicate through a consensus interface, similar to the Dependency Inversion Principle in SOLID principles of object-oriented programming (it's okay if you don't understand); the same concept can be applied to communication.

The first step is to identify areas that are vague, require repeated confirmation, or need specific communication to be more focused and effective, or even matters that only require this delivery without additional communication.

Once the issues are identified, we can define the "interface." The interface serves as a medium and can be a document, process, checklist, or tool, etc.

Using this "interface" as a bridge for communication, there can be multiple interfaces; use the appropriate interface for each scenario. When encountering the same scenario, prioritize using this interface for initial communication; if further discussion is needed, it can be based on this interface to delve into focused issues.

#### App Team and External Collaboration

Here are four examples of interface communication using the App Team collaboration as an example:

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*QeKDmnbkrkQvMU2yn8FBZg.png)

The first is the collaboration with Backend, which may lead to the situation shown in the image above before any consensus on the interface.

Regarding how to use the API, if we simply provide the API Response String to the App Team, it can lead to ambiguities. For example, how do we know if `date` refers to the Register Date or Birthday? There are many fields that need confirmation.

This communication is also repetitive; every time there is a new Endpoint, it needs to be confirmed again.

This is a classic case of ineffective communication.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*FQy-Xr_V6sz9cuppumVaFw.png)

What the App and Backend lack is a communication interface. There are many solutions, and it doesn't necessarily have to be a tool; it can simply be a manually maintained document.

![[This was shared during the 2020 Pinkoi Developer Night — by Toki](https://www.yourator.co/articles/171#Toki){:target="_blank"}](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*q_MQ6y3RPKeO7q-zxSGqDg.png)

[This was shared during the 2020 Pinkoi Developer Night — by Toki](https://www.yourator.co/articles/171#Toki){:target="_blank"}

Pinkoi uses Python (FastAPI) to automatically generate documentation from API Code, and PHP can use Swagger (as previously done in the company); the advantage is that the overall framework and data format of the documentation can be automatically generated from the Code, reducing maintenance costs, and only the field descriptions need to be handled.

p.s. Currently, the new Python 3 will use FastAPI, and the old parts will be gradually updated, temporarily using PostMan as the communication interface.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*luRT1gAUkFuxSixkd-OsrA.png)

The second is collaboration with Product Designers, which is fundamentally similar to Backend, but the issues revolve around confirming UI Specs and Flow.

If color codes and fonts are scattered, our App will also suffer. Setting aside the requirements, we do not want situations where the same Title has the same color but different color codes or where the UI is inconsistent in the same position. 

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*smel97dJH6y2LzXdWTKYYw.jpeg)

```markdown
The most fundamental solution is to first ask the designers to organize the UI component library, establish a Design System (Guideline), and properly label the UI when it is created.

In our Code Base, we establish the corresponding Font and Color based on the Design System (Guideline) and create Buttons and Views according to the component library.

When templating, we uniformly use these established components, making it easy for us to quickly align with the UI design drafts.

> **_However, this can easily become chaotic and requires dynamic adjustments; it cannot cover too many special cases, nor can it be rigid and not expand._**

p.s. The collaboration between Pinkoi and Product Designers is mutual; Developers can also propose better practices for discussion with Product Designers.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*jWzR6iVOeXD9naa3KQllLw.png)

The third aspect is the interface with Customer Service. The reviews in the marketplace are very important for products, but it is a very manual and repetitive communication process.

Because we need to manually check new reviews from time to time, and if there are customer service issues, we forward the problems to customer service for assistance, which is very repetitive and manual.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*2e_pEWb1khuMTgJPkpCY9w.png)

The best solution is to allow marketplace reviews to automatically sync to our work platform. We can spend $ to buy existing services or use the tools I developed, [ZhgChgLi](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi){:target="_blank"} / [ZReviewTender](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} (new in 2022).

> _For deployment methods, tutorials, and technical details, please refer to:_ [**ZReviewTender — Free and Open Source App Reviews Monitoring Bot**](../e36e48bb9265/)

This bot serves as our communication interface, automatically forwarding reviews to the Slack Channel, allowing everyone to quickly receive the latest review information and track, communicate, and discuss on it.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*9SG2JlwEfNSJq9WxscfV5w.png)

The last example is the dependency on the Localization Team. Whether it's new features or modifying old translations, we need to wait for the Localization Team to complete their work before we can assist with the follow-up.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*vJcYjkcLpZcKRvgFzP5C1g.png)

The cost of developing this tool ourselves is too high, so we directly use third-party services to help us eliminate dependencies.

All translations and Keys are managed by third-party tools. We just need to define the Keys in advance to act independently; both parties only need to complete their work before the Deadline for packaging, without relying on each other. After the Localization Team completes the translations, the tool will automatically trigger a git pull to update the latest text files into the project.

p.s. Pinkoi has had this process since early on, initially using Onesky, but in recent years, there are more excellent tools available that can be considered for adoption.

#### App Team Collaboration Within the Team

What was just discussed was external; now let's talk about internal collaboration.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*Jg0DrQsNe1QA6UOT3Z_elg.png)

When there are few people or when a single developer maintains a project, you can do whatever you want. Your grasp and understanding of the project are very high, so there are not many issues. Of course, if you have a good sense, you can accomplish everything mentioned here even as a one-person project.

However, as the number of collaborating teammates increases, and everyone is working under the same project, if everyone continues to work independently, it will be a disaster.

For example, if one person does API this way and another does it that way, it often leads to reinventing the wheel, wasting time, or not caring at all and just throwing something online, which will significantly increase future maintenance and scalability costs.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*5wBfMU9AiCVfmEcvmPZSiQ.png)

Within the team, rather than calling it an interface, I think it sounds too distant; it should be referred to as consensus and resonance to foster a stronger team awareness.

The most basic and often-discussed topic is Coding Style, such as naming conventions, placement, how to use Delegates, etc. We can impose constraints using commonly used industry tools like [realm](https://github.com/realm){:target="_blank"} / [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint){:target="_blank"}; multilingual statements can be organized using [freshOS](https://github.com/freshOS){:target="_blank"} / [Localize](https://github.com/freshOS/Localize){:target="_blank"} (of course, if you are already using the aforementioned unified management by third-party tools, you can skip this).
```


The second aspect is the app architecture. Whether it's MVC/MVVM/VIPER/Clean Architecture, the core focus is on cleanliness and unity; there's no need to chase trends, just ensure consistency.

> _The Pinkoi App Team uses [Clean Architecture](https://www.yourator.co/articles/171#Matt){:target="_blank"}._ 

> _Previously at StreetVoice, we only used pure MVC, but it was clean and unified, making collaboration smooth._ 

Additionally, there's Unit Testing. With many people involved, it's hard to avoid the risk of the logic you implemented being accidentally broken one day; writing more tests provides an extra layer of assurance.

Lastly, there's the documentation aspect, which includes the team's workflow, specifications, or operation manuals, making it easy for teammates to quickly reference when they forget and for newcomers to get up to speed quickly.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*8Ywxhvk1dzmDLGLunuHNww.png)

Besides the code-level interfaces, there are other interfaces that help us improve efficiency in collaboration.

The first is a Request for Comments phase before implementing requirements, where the developer briefly explains how the requirement will be executed, allowing others to provide feedback and ideas.

This not only prevents reinventing the wheel but also encourages brainstorming. For example, it helps consider how others might expand on the work later or what future requirements might need to be taken into account… etc. Those involved may be confused, but outsiders can see clearly.

The second is conducting thorough Code Reviews to ensure our interface consensus is being upheld, such as: naming conventions, UI layout methods, delegate usage, protocol/class declarations… etc. We also check if the architecture is being misused or hastily written, and if the development direction is moving towards a fully Swift approach, ensuring there isn't still Objective-C code being submitted… etc.

The main focus is on reviewing these aspects, followed by whether the functionality is working correctly… and similar support.

p.s. The purpose of RFC is to enhance work efficiency, so it shouldn't be overly lengthy or severely hinder work progress; think of it as a simple discussion phase before starting work.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*nn--T1ToO7FxRUHAv_3vig.png)

To summarize the function of interface consensus within the team, I want to mention a **Crash Theory** mindset, which I think is a good behavioral benchmark.

![Excerpt from [MBA Knowledge Base](https://wiki.mbalib.com/zh-tw/%E5%9D%A0%E6%9C%BA%E7%90%86%E8%AE%BA){:target="_blank"}](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*QJ8P_HjSvPdYrUmrqsQZXA.png)

Excerpt from [MBA Knowledge Base](https://wiki.mbalib.com/zh-tw/%E5%9D%A0%E6%9C%BA%E7%90%86%E8%AE%BA){:target="_blank"}

Applied to the team, it assumes that if everyone suddenly disappears, can the existing code, processes, and systems allow new people to quickly get up to speed?

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*Q44KLIwDjvAPuNDDf6KB3g.png)

Recapping the significance of interfaces, the interfaces within the team are used to increase mutual consensus, while collaboration outside the team aims to reduce ineffective communication. Using interfaces as communication tools helps focus on requirement discussions without interruptions.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*WXYAk1_4fA0kll-HyMXL5w.png)

To reiterate, "interface communication" is not some special proprietary term or tool; it's just a concept applicable to any collaborative scenario. It can simply be a document or process, and it should come first before communication takes place.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*oN-qJ4lNMtijsCoSIqrr_g.png)

Here, assuming each additional communication takes 10 minutes, with a team of 60 people, occurring 10 times a month, that results in 1,200 hours wasted on unnecessary communication in a year.
### Improving Efficiency — Automating Repetitive Tasks

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*vMq1UmYeW611XYf0yHv8AQ.png)

In this chapter, I want to share with everyone the effects of automating repetitive tasks on improving work efficiency, using iOS as an example, but the same approach applies to Android.

I won't delve into the technical implementation details, just discussing the feasibility of the principles.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*i_0yUCYq6jl-7uf5mynxLA.png)

Let's summarize the services we use, including but not limited to:
- Slack: Communication software
- Fastlane: iOS automation scripting tool
- Github: Git provider
- Github Action: Github's CI/CD service, which will be introduced later
- Firebase: Crashlytics, Events, App Distribution (to be introduced later), Remote Config…
- Google Apps Script: Plugin scripting for Google Apps, to be introduced later
- Bitrise: CI/CD server
- Onesky: A third-party tool for localization mentioned earlier
- Testflight: iOS app internal testing platform
- Google Calendar: Google Calendar, which will be introduced later
- Asana: Project management tool

#### Issues with Releasing Beta Versions

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*kaNm3auxnqlJ4ObE84sitA.png)

The first recurring issue to mention is when our app is in the development phase and we want to allow other teammates to test it early. Traditionally, this involves directly borrowing a phone to build the app; if there are only 1-2 people, it’s not a big deal, but with a team of 20-30 people needing to test, just helping to install the beta version means no work gets done that day. Moreover, if there are updates, everything has to be redone.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*r_jYD3jukkUPKOdtnK8zyA.png)

Another method is to use TestFlight as a medium for releasing beta versions, which I think is also good; however, there are two problems. The first is that TestFlight is equivalent to a production environment, not a debug one. The second is that when there are many teammates developing different requirements simultaneously, TestFlight can become chaotic, and the builds can change frequently, but it’s still feasible.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*XLB0THtHAM65_e4FdtEXKg.png)

At Pinkoi, the solution is to first separate the task of "installing the beta version by the App Team" and use Slack Workflow as the input UI to achieve this. Once the input is complete, it triggers Bitrise to run a Fastlane script to package and upload the beta IPA to Firebase App Distribution.

> _For reference on using Slack Workflow, see this article: [Creating a Fully Automated WFH Employee Health Reporting System with Slack](../d61062833c1a/)_

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*2mNIlReKlROzcgviY9_JTg.jpeg)

![Firebase App Distribution](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*dwwOvnVwuF1sCUnyppBCDQ.jpeg)

Firebase App Distribution

Teammates who need to test can simply follow the steps in Firebase App Distribution to install the certificates and register their devices, allowing them to select and install the desired beta version or directly go back to click the link in the email to install.

> _However, it is important to note that iOS Firebase App Distribution occupies Development Devices, with a limit of only 100 devices that can be registered, based on devices rather than individuals._

> _Therefore, it may be necessary to weigh this against the TestFlight solution (1,000 external testers by person)._

At least the earlier Slack Workflow UI input is a consideration for adoption.

> _For advanced implementations, you could develop a Slack Bot, which can provide a more complete and customized process and forms._

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*-2oet_gRdews7-wccdrmiA.png)

Recapping the effectiveness of automating the release of beta versions, the most significant impact is moving the entire process to the cloud, allowing the App Team to be hands-off and fully self-service.

#### Issues with Packaging Official Versions

The second task that the App Team frequently needs to perform is packaging and submitting the official version of the app.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*Fd245lp2QSQV7d3AIdf94w.png)

When the team is small, with only single-threaded development, issues with app version updates are manageable, allowing for both freedom and regularity.

However, when the team grows and there are multiple concurrent requirements in development and iteration, situations like the one depicted above arise. If the "interface communication" mentioned earlier is not well established, everyone will work on their own, leading to the App Team being overwhelmed, as the cost of app updates is higher than that of web pages, and the process is cumbersome. On the other hand, frequent and chaotic updates can also disrupt users.

Finally, there is a management issue; without a fixed process or schedule, it is challenging to optimize what needs to be done at each step.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*eRm97daYTwlEBFGtWoZgdQ.png)

The issues are as above.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*3b_wX91dtYF0ogHjKsaR6g.png)

The solution is to introduce a Release Train into the development process, with the core concept being to separate version updates from project development.

We will fix the schedule and define what will be done at each stage:
- Fixed updates on Monday mornings
- Fixed Code Freeze on Wednesdays (no more merging feature PRs)
- Fixed QA starts on Thursdays
- Fixed packaging on Fridays

The actual timeline (how long QA takes) and release cycle (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly) can be adjusted according to each company's situation. **The core is to determine what fixed tasks will be done at what time.**

This is a survey of version update cycles shared by foreign developers, with most being every two weeks.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*uOXXmdDoocyFImsq-z7tVQ.png)

```markdown
Taking the weekly updates and our multi-team approach as an example, it looks like the image above.

As the name suggests, a Release Train is like a train station, where each version is a train.

**If you miss it, you'll have to wait for the next one.** Each Squad team and project can choose when to board.

This is a great communication interface; as long as everyone has a consensus and follows the rules, updates can be made in an orderly manner.

**For more technical details on Release Trains, please refer to:**
- [Mobile release trains — Travelperk](https://speakerdeck.com/lgvalle/mobile-release-trains){:target="_blank"}
- [Agile Release Train](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/agile-release-train/){:target="_blank"}
- [Release Quality and Mobile Trains](https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/quality-mobile-trains){:target="_blank"}



![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*DZwSmwnVCGkO--1PEzgqgw.png)


Once the process and schedule are confirmed, we can optimize what needs to be done at each stage.

For instance, packaging the official version using traditional manual methods is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The entire process from packaging, uploading, to submission takes about an hour, during which one has to constantly switch work states, making it difficult to do other tasks; this process is repeated every time packaging is done, wasting work efficiency.


![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*RPSgRUXh3ITDJykQ6N-DTw.png)


Since we have already fixed the schedule, we can directly integrate Google Calendar, adding the tasks to be done on the planned schedule to the calendar. When the time comes, Google Apps Script will call Bitrise to execute the Fastlane script for packaging the official version and submission, completing all tasks.

Using Google Calendar integration has another advantage: if unexpected situations arise that require postponement or advancement, you can simply change the date directly.


> _To automatically execute Google Apps Script at the scheduled time of a Google Calendar event, you currently need to set up your own service. For a quick solution, you can use IFTTT as a bridge between Google Calendar &lt;\-&gt; Bitrise/Google Apps Script. For more details, please [refer to this article](https://gist.github.com/tanaikech/fbbfaa8f2a8a770424974aa16b9b6f3b){:target="_blank"}._



p\.s\. 
1\. Currently, the Pinkoi iOS Team is using the Gitflow workflow.
2\. In principle, this consensus must be followed by all teams, so we do not want any requests that break this rule (e.g., needing to release on a special Wednesday). However, for projects in collaboration with external parties, flexibility must be maintained if absolutely necessary, as this consensus is internal to the team.
3\. HotFixes for serious issues can be updated at any time and are not subject to Release Train regulations.


![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*tBGh-uxgoCTXfQ-u4GZq8g.png)


Here, I have also mentioned the application of Google Apps Scripts; for details, please refer to: [Using Google Apps Script to Forward Gmail Messages to Slack](../d414bdbdb8c9/) .


![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*gdwkOBumSPH469IMCd8TVw.png)


The last point is using GitHub Actions to enhance collaboration efficiency (PR Review).

GitHub Actions is GitHub's CI/CD service that can be directly tied to GitHub events, with triggers ranging from open issues, open PRs to merging PRs, etc.

GitHub Actions can be used for any Git project hosted on GitHub. Public Repos have no restrictions, while Private Repos have a free quota of 2,000 minutes per month.

**Here are two features:**
- (Left) After a PR Review is completed, it automatically adds a reviewer name label, allowing us to quickly summarize the PR review status.
- (Right) Every day at a fixed time, it organizes and sends messages to the Slack Channel, reminding teammates which PRs are awaiting review ([mimicking the functionality of Pull Reminders](https://pullreminders.com/){:target="_blank"}).

GitHub Actions has many other automation possibilities; everyone can unleash their imagination.
```


Like the issue bots commonly seen in open source projects:

![[fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane){:target="_blank"} / [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane){:target="_blank"}](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*64GaqzcldMHwU-HE4yt3_A.png)

[fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane){:target="_blank"} / [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane){:target="_blank"}

Or automatically closing pull requests that haven't been merged for too long can be accomplished using GitHub Actions.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*olR70CQ2zbvTWwzh72-gRQ.png)

Recapping the effectiveness of automating the packaging of official releases, we directly use existing tools for integration; in addition to **automation, we also incorporate fixed processes to double the efficiency of work.**

Originally, aside from the time spent on manual packaging, there were additional costs associated with communication about release timing, which are now reduced to zero; as long as we ensure to **get on board** within the schedule, we can focus all our time on "discussion" and "development."

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*8CZSygOrZbXPVIDzx2AFRQ.png)

Calculating the total effectiveness brought by these two automations, we can save 216 working hours in a year.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*d3I-cJoeUiT_h2uvZ8PgFw.png)

With automation and the previously mentioned communication interface, let's see how much efficiency we can improve by doing these things.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*xMFfrYqGJD6CPY8YTIVMIg.png)

In addition to the items just completed, we also need to evaluate the [**cost of switching flow**](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BF%83%E6%B5%81%E7%90%86%E8%AB%96){:target="_blank"}; when we continuously engage in work for a period, we enter a "flow" state, where our thoughts and productivity peak, allowing for the most effective output; however, if interrupted by trivial matters (e.g., unnecessary communication, repetitive tasks), it takes time to return to the flow, which we can estimate as 30 minutes.

![](/assets/11f6c8568154/1*_1Pe12uYqddPyd5muKuTMw.png)

The cost of switching flow due to trivial interruptions should also be included in the calculation; here we estimate 30 minutes each time, occurring 10 times a month, resulting in an additional waste of 3,600 hours for 60 people in a year.

Cost of switching flow (3,600) + unnecessary communication due to poor communication interface (1,200) + repetitive tasks resolved by automation (216) = a total loss of 5,016 hours in a year.

The time wasted on work can be redirected to more valuable tasks, so the actual productivity gain should be multiplied by 200%.

Recapping the inner workings of a high-efficiency work team, we mainly did the following:

> **_No Code/Low Code First_** _Prioritize using existing tools for integration (as shown in this example); if no existing tools are available, then evaluate the cost of investing in automation against the actual savings._ 

### About Cultural Support

At Pinkoi, everyone can be a problem-solving leader.

For problem-solving and making changes, it often requires a lot of teamwork to achieve better results, which greatly relies on the support and encouragement of company culture; otherwise, pushing it alone can be very challenging.

> _At Pinkoi, everyone can be a problem-solving leader; it doesn't have to be a Lead or PM to solve problems. Many of the communication interfaces, tools, or automation projects introduced earlier are often identified and proposed by teammates, and everyone works together to complete them._

Regarding how team culture supports driving change, the four stages of problem-solving can be linked to Pinkoi's Core Values.

**Step One: Grow Beyond Yesterday**
- Better is always possible; if a problem is discovered, regardless of its size, as mentioned earlier, small issues can also have an amplifying effect as the team grows.
- Investigate and summarize the issues, avoiding premature optimization (some problems may just be temporary transitions).

**Next is Build Partnerships**
- Actively communicate and gather suggestions from all aspects
- Maintain empathy (as some issues may be the best solution for the other party, be prepared to weigh options)

**Step Three: Impact Beyond Your Role**
- Leverage your influence
- Propose problem-solving plans
- Prioritize automation solutions if related to repetitive tasks
- Remember to maintain flexibility and scalability to avoid over-engineering

**Finally, Dare to Fail!**
- Be brave in practice
- Continuously track and dynamically adjust solutions
- **After achieving success, remember to share the results with the team to facilitate cross-departmental resource integration** (as the same issue may exist in multiple departments)

**This concludes the sharing of Pinkoi's high-efficiency engineering team secrets. Thank you, everyone.**
