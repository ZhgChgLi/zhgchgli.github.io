### \[Travel Diary\] 2024 Bangkok, Thailand 🇹🇭 5-Day Free Trip

Returning to Thailand after the pandemic for a quick five-day trip to Bangkok.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*kRZZjY_7_6WaKRkw9E74iw.jpeg)

#### Memories of Bangkok

Let's rewind to 2018, my first job and my first company trip, which was also my first time traveling abroad, to Bangkok + Hua Hin (5 days); the following year in 2019, I went to Sabah with my colleagues; then came the two years stolen by the pandemic, after which I went crazy with trips to Japan.

Back then, I was a total newbie with zero social experience, blindly following my older siblings around. I didn't even know what I could or couldn't bring on the plane. At security, I foolishly left my passport in the basket, only to find it on the conveyor belt when I exited the machine, nearly giving me a heart attack (if it had fallen into a gap, I wouldn't have been able to return). That trip was a mindless group tour, and my impressions of Bangkok were not very clear; I only remembered that the rooftop bars were great, the weather was hot, things were cheap, and massages were affordable—nothing more, and I had no concept of geography.

Thus, I always thought about returning to Bangkok to relive the memories from six years ago. However, I wasn't familiar with Southeast Asia and was hesitant to travel alone. **It just so happened that at the beginning of the year, while chatting with colleagues from Pinkoi, we decided to plan this five-day free trip to Bangkok.**

> _The details and fragments of memories from the 2018 Bangkok + Hua Hin five-day trip are included in the appendix at the end of the article._

Since I started a new job in June, I wasn't really focused on leisure activities. Mark and Sean were mainly responsible for the arrangements and planning, and I didn't do much research.

> **_⚠️⚠️⚠️ I have included safety tips and precautions for traveling in Bangkok at the end of the travel diary. You can skip the diary but make sure to understand the precautions against scams and what to be aware of if you want to avoid trouble with marijuana._**

#### Internet

This time, the preparation was rushed, and I hadn't set up the internet the day before. I didn't have time to buy my usual physical SIM card, so I decided to try eSIM for the first time. \(I fell in love with it right away\)

I bought the [**Thailand SIM Card | AIS 5G High-Speed Internet 8 Days Unlimited Data + Calls eSIM**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} directly from KKday, and after purchasing, I received the eSIM activation certificate right away, so I could use it immediately.

- **Has a physical number, can make calls, and receive SMS!**
- Days are calculated on a 24-hour basis, starting from the activation of the eSIM, with 24 hours counting as one day (Thailand time).

[Mainly an all-you-can-eat deal, cheaper than a physical SIM card, 8 days for NT $232.](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}
#### Flight 🛫
- Outbound: TPE 16:00 -> BKK 18:45
- Return: BKK 15:20 -> TPE 20:10

Airline: Thai VietJet Air (Low-cost carrier)

Price: `TWD $9,259` (including an additional **15 kg** checked baggage)

Initially, I thought about traveling with everyone, and my friends didn't check in any luggage (ticket prices were around `$6,000`). Later, I checked other airlines and felt I missed out; other airlines had similar prices around `$10,000`, not much difference, but much more comfortable!

Thai VietJet Air's baggage policy actually allows you not to check in luggage; you can carry two pieces of hand luggage, with a total weight not exceeding 7 kg.
```
1. Hand luggage weight:
Each passenger (except infants) can bring 1 piece of their own luggage and 1 small hand luggage, with a maximum total weight not exceeding 7 kg.

2. Hand luggage dimensions:
- 01 piece of hand luggage with maximum dimensions of 56cm x 36cm x 23cm
- 01 small hand luggage (including the following bags)
  + 01 bag for girls, magazines, cameras, baby food bags, and bags purchased at the airport not exceeding 30cm x 20cm x 10cm.
  + 01 bag for outerwear that, when opened, does not exceed 114cm x 60cm x 11cm.
  + 01 bag for a laptop with maximum dimensions of 40cm x 30cm x 10cm.
```

> [_Information as of 2024/08/22, everything is subject to the latest official announcements._](https://www.vietjetair.com/zh-TW/pages/%E8%A1%8C%E6%9D%8E%E8%A6%8F%E5%AE%9A-1607068164219){:target="_blank"}

Basically, just carrying a backpack and dragging a carry-on suitcase is sufficient.
#### 8/1 Flight Change Notification

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*fSzvcnbHkpMBgPMLq5kSWQ.png)

Received a flight change notification email on the night of 8/1, with the schedule changed to depart at 16:35 and arrive at 19:20.

### 8/02 Day 1 Departure
#### Departing from home around 12:30 PM

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*YsFObRlulrMFKHySvo3NAw.jpeg)

> _Remember to take the direct train to the airport; the regular train, even if it’s in the morning, won’t get you there faster than the direct train!_

#### Arriving at Taoyuan Airport Terminal 1 around 13:30

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*BBE4RhKU9tcJI427_LoQMw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ksagRFmStL9nLBWIyYY3Jg.png)

There was no one at the check-in counter, so I checked in and completed the baggage drop-off right away.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GI5u8vhrNRbFdG-XqY_2LQ.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*CBOJ0KHI4dMmAP5REh1UaA.jpeg)

Once again, it was B1R, the farthest corner, requiring a shuttle bus to the boarding gate.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XMQJOe1n5vyVdWQrYJpgNg.png)

With plenty of time before the 4 PM flight, I went to eat at the airport's Ding Tai Fung. This time I discovered that I could order just the dumplings, which were previously only available as part of a fried chicken meal!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*hfpWAbwiM2Aal3MZJ36oOA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XNjYtycibxeowQBaDT_jNw.jpeg)

I also realized that if you walk straight from Ding Tai Fung, you can access Terminal 2, so if you have time, you can go to Terminal 2 for food; or Terminal 2 can come to Terminal 1 for the free VIP lounge XD.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t4dk8GQIv0D53N0V_qo7KA.png)

After buying my meal, I went to the free VIP lounge in Terminal 1 to relax and eat. This time I saw someone charging their device; [last time I came, all the outlets were taken, but it seems they have fixed it](../cb65fd5ab770/) (?).
#### Around 15:30, heading to B1R boarding room

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*2Ros8CQBKj0-kkMugSZ7Hg.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*At7elbjIueB9lvvenvlfTA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*fpzrwzWez_HwgKFuFmDAhA.png)

I don't know if it's because it's a low-cost airline, but the information wasn't updated (it kept showing 16:00, but it had actually changed to 16:35).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*puKndBRQgCKs3LKbXbzEWw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*zCT2uidCELNc7WL1NpW72Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1aGwmjed9srQtHli3uDoxg.jpeg)

With the flight delayed, the actual departure time was 17:13.
- VietJet's seats are about the same size as Tigerair's, larger than Peach Aviation, but the seats are uncomfortable, with non-breathable leather material that makes your butt hurt after sitting for too long.
- VietJet seems to allow you to eat your own food; on the return flight, someone was eating mango sticky rice without any issues.

#### 19:30 Arrive at Bangkok BKK Suvarnabhumi Airport

I only learned from my colleagues that if you arrive at Bangkok Airport during peak hours, you can purchase the [**Thailand Airport BKK Departure Meet and Greet Fast Track Service**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/160605?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} for a quick pass through customs XD. However, since we arrived at this time, there were almost only people from our flight, so the customs process was very quick.
#### 20:00 Collect luggage and exit the airport

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*QDvOtf4PsS-jSESOkb-0AA.jpeg)

Perhaps due to the low-cost airline, there weren't many people checking in luggage, and we got our bags super fast.
#### eSIM Network Setup

As soon as I exited the airport, I started figuring out how to set up and activate the eSIM, only to find out…

> **_⚠️Activating eSIM requires an internet connection⚠️_** 

> **_⚠️Activating eSIM requires an internet connection⚠️_** 

> **_⚠️Activating eSIM requires an internet connection⚠️_** 

It's a bit like buying a pair of scissors but needing another pair to cut open the packaging; activating the eSIM requires an internet connection to get it started. Luckily, a friend traveling with me had already activated his eSIM in Taiwan, so I borrowed his internet to activate mine. \(The airport also has Wi\-Fi available, so there's no need to worry too much\)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*_xv7JB_yl7d47ljrUTpYdw.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6vg_zfmf6tr3SIBUj6gi4A.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7-7yMcMgwbpNzBq1YgknaQ.png)

To find the eSIM settings, just long-press the QR code and select "Add eSIM."

> **_I don't know why, but if you save the QR code to photos or notes, you lose the quick add feature. Another method is to send the QR code to a travel companion or print it out for your phone to scan._** 

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*hZBZoEJCLuHxEgbOVMEXBw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*KMKLtNg2Aaeug_cn5fitNQ.jpeg)

iPhone iOS eSIM manual setup path: Settings \-> Cellular \-> Add eSIM \-> Scan QR Code \-> Manually enter information \-> Use as... you can select "Travel" \-> Choose "Travel" for mobile data \-> Done!

Once activated, it’s like having dual SIMs, but the original SIM card won’t have internet until you purchase a roaming plan. **In case of emergency, you can switch back to the original SIM card!**
- [For AIS, dial \*545\# to check your phone number, \*121\# to check your balance, and \*121\*3\# to check your data](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}

#### 20:30 Finding Food at the Airport

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*mDPRItCdp28u5P6tTQelqQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*bgHNI9p20Jyf3t3IMDExMQ.jpeg)

Since it takes over an hour to get to the city and hotel, and the low-cost airline doesn’t provide meals, everyone was quite hungry, so we decided to grab dinner at the airport.

We found a Thai restaurant and had some spicy minced pork, which was really delicious and paired well with vegetable soup to ease the heat.
#### 21:00 Moving to the Hotel

> _👉👉👉 You can refer to KKday's airport transfer service:_ 

> _[\- Thailand | Airport Private Transfer | Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) / Don Mueang Airport (DMK) — Bangkok/Pattaya/Hua Hin City Hotels](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/3431-bkk-or-dmk-bangkok-private-transfer?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*cagHOMc-TKS9fmhN18zVOQ.png)

After eating, around 21:00, we started moving towards the city and the hotel.

**Taking public transport requires three transfers between the subway and BTS:**
1. Airport Rail Link `Suvarnabhumi` \-> `Phaya Thai`
2. BTS Sukhumvit Line `Phaya Thai` \-> `Siam`
3. BTS Silom Line `Siam` \-> `Chong Nonsi`

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OvL8K9OxwjMCVJ-3hYy2bw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*-eJ_rrYns2teWCITXTnhTA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*PeWlfQ6fd55mU1Ojk0isJQ.png)

- The Airport Rail Link only allows ticket purchases.
- BTS tickets can be bought at the ticket counter for the Rabbit Card \(BTS transit card\) for top-ups and entry/exit.
- Please note that the **Rabbit Card can only be used on BTS**, not on MRT or the Airport Rail Link.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*EF3IK_FXS4n3igDOsJ0C4A.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*jY4Jg6_vGhAM5CjPrVM-Iw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Dom8OdbMSRAAXtFpykCTZQ.png)

- Arrived at `Chong Nonsi` \(later I found out that the King Power MahaNakhon building is at this station!\)

#### Walking to [JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL](https://jckevin.com/){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6VrvZBTlo2gjg_lY7oQG8w.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*cgv3HGHsAkH8WL_jA6qTsg.jpeg)

When exiting the BTS, don’t rush down the overpass; you can walk across the road from the overpass.

> **_I felt it was quite dark along the way \(not many streetlights\), and it was quite a long walk \(15 mins / 1 KM\). It could be a bit scary to walk alone at night_**, and along the way, you will pass a 7–11 and a small night market, where I bought some snacks to take back to the hotel. 

> _Also, if you take a taxi, due to the two-way road and U-turn issues, the driver has to go past the hotel a bit to the next gap to turn back, which is a bit of a hassle._ 

#### 10:30 Arrive at JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL

Arrived at the hotel around 10:30.

[![JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL](/assets/b7e7c0938985/43d8_hqdefault.jpg "JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg24V_VS6oA){:target="_blank"}

The room is very spacious, like a whole apartment, with a master bedroom, a secondary bedroom, two bathrooms, a kitchen, a living room, and a balcony.
#### 2018 Memories

I didn’t expect it to be such a coincidence that during the group employee trip to Bangkok in 2018, everyone took a taxi to the rooftop bar of this hotel at night XD.

Additionally, they also offer a Sky Bar dinner package:

#### 2024

Since I’m staying here, after dropping off my luggage in the room, I went up to take a look.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*h8ksUQqToXHPTda_RnwkSg.jpeg)

Since it was already past dinner time, I could only order some snacks and skewers.
### 8/03 Day 2 Wat Pho, Grand Palace, Wat Phra Kaew, Wat Arun, ICONSIAM, Lhao Lhao, Rock Pub Live
#### Hotel Breakfast

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7m7nqO5Q1kdTTPQsdx9TWg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t1xva8yggECe94znx32pew.jpeg)

After having breakfast at the hotel in the morning, I headed out. I thought the breakfast was okay, but there weren’t many options.
#### 9:30 Departure

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*A2zezLiqIEOngnuebgxUjA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dZQvSlCNcBjgE4-mdnFZMQ.jpeg)

Since there were many people, we directly took a Grab \(THB 135\) to Wat Pho.

On the way, we passed through [Chinatown](https://www.kkday.com/zh-hk/blog/101689/bangkokchinatown?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}, but I forgot to take a photo; it had a very cyberpunk vibe!

You need to take off your shoes to enter, and you can walk around the Reclining Buddha to pay your respects.
#### SuperRich Currency Exchange

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GKVidaEFygfEMNjfKFNweA.jpeg)

After leaving Wat Pho, I thought I should first solve the currency exchange issue. Only one friend in the group had exchanged some Thai Baht in advance; the others thought they would exchange in Bangkok. So after exiting, we walked to the nearby [The Old Siam Shopping Plaza⁩](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UPNxgoTmtswuhHVS8){:target="_blank"} to exchange money at SuperRich.

**⚠️Please note: The Taiwanese dollars you want to exchange must not have stains, markings, etc., otherwise they will be rejected for exchange. \(I happened to have a thousand-dollar bill from an ATM in Taiwan that had a pencil mark on it and was rejected for exchange\)**

> _NTD $5,000 exchanged for THB $5,200_

Khanom bueang Thai Pancake

After exchanging money, with cash in hand, I replenished my energy at the food market on the first floor; I had a sweet Thai pancake \(ขนมเบื้อง\) filled with meringue, which was very sweet and tasted like cotton candy, along with a banana pancake; finally, I bought an iced coffee to continue on my way.
#### Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew

Entrance fee: THB 500/person.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*NVu8tXAG7D3sGNRQi-PHGw.jpeg)

Around 13:00, after exiting the Grand Palace, we found a Western restaurant nearby towards the pier to grab lunch.
#### 14:00 Preparing to Take the Boat to Wat Arun

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ePMFJ1jf5orPQRQTEJHMnQ.jpeg)

> **_⚠️There will be people outside the pier trying to solicit you; be careful as they are private boat operators who charge high fees \(THB 500, 1000\) and are not safe; just ignore them and find the official pier and counter to tell them where you want to go.⚠️_** 

> **_The official ticket price is only THB 30 \(_** _`Tha Chang` **to Wat Arun\), and the new boats have air conditioning, making them safe and comfortable.**_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ccUJ7WKGfb73k8UWEDNesg.jpeg)

When the boat arrives, the staff will announce "Wat Arun" \(yes, in Chinese\), and you can ask anytime if you're unsure.

The time is approaching afternoon, and a thunderstorm is on the way. You can see the water flowing muddy and turbulent.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8hMHmiUOANTISYOVpTISiA.jpeg)

The boat is quite new, the air conditioning is cool, it's very safe in the enclosed space, and there are plenty of departures, making it very convenient!

When you arrive, the staff will also announce "Wat Arun."

#### 14:30 Arrive at Wat Arun

Ticket price: THB 200

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ujWr_UkXTX__M2jEz06sUw.jpeg)

After disembarking, you will find yourself at Wat Arun, where you can directly queue to buy tickets for entry.

> **_⚠️ Wat Arun also has a dress code️⚠️_** 

> **_No exposed shoulders, shorts, bare midriffs, or short skirts._** 

> **_You can wear traditional Thai clothing; many people wear it for photos._**

You can walk to the middle platform for photos \(⚠️ The stairs are steep, so be careful\). Many people also change into traditional Thai clothing to take commemorative photos here.

After visiting, return to the pier and find the ticket booth \(PIER 2\) to buy a ticket to ICONSIAM \(THB 40\), then head to PIER 1 to board.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*MbiMV91xnwXQqSTg4UUx1g.jpeg)

ICONSIAM is huge and looks very luxurious, with a food court on the first floor that has a lot of character.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*fuuOJMUI4D8F0zPOEH1geg.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*eLZgR_Wmmnt0oWkwO-d-KQ.jpeg)

I bought a cup of ChaTraMue hand-brewed Thai milk tea to recharge.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*P-p65azTMpWowyRbZuyxhQ.png)

I continued exploring until I reached the BTS Charoen Nakhon platform, thinking I would first get a one-hour foot massage.

There was a newer, larger place \(1\) THAI GARDEN MASSAGE outside the station, but they were fully booked; fortunately, I walked a bit further to \(2\) another massage shop, as shown in the picture; I found it very comfortable, less crowded, spacious, and quieter, with a cheap rate \(foot/1 hour/THB 270\).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*s6--mVkXnO3wqrcTHRgL0Q.png)

After the massage, I had the energy to continue shopping, returning to ICONSIAM; I walked all the way to the upstairs restaurant, which was also quite extravagant, featuring a jungle, small bridges, and waterfalls—overall, it was very nice!

> _I bought the famous Japanese fries, TORO FRIES \(the line was very long\) to recharge._ 

> _They also have Japanese % coffee here._ 

#### Head to LHAO LHAO for dinner

This line is a branch with only three stations and less frequent service.

> _Google Maps seems to have no information about this BTS line; it suggested I walk to Krung Thon Buri._ 

From here, taking one stop to Krung Thon Buri connects to the Silom Line.

At Siam, I switched to the Sukhumvit Line and got off at Ari Station, which is just a short walk to LHAO LHAO restaurant.
#### 19:00 [LHAO LHAO](https://bkk.com.tw/2012-12-12-186/#LHAO_LHAO_%E7%A8%80%E9%A3%AF%EF%BC%88%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%95%E0%B9%8D%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%95%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B8%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%87%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B2%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B2%EF%BC%89){:target="_blank"}

The owner seems to be Chinese? It feels like a fusion of Chinese and Thai cuisine, a highly-rated old restaurant, and apparently a favorite of Blackpink's LISA.

Since I was going to a pub later to listen to live music, I ate a bit hurriedly, but I thought every dish was delicious!!
- In the first three images, the dish with the background of the goose brand cooling paste, called หมูสับผัดหนำเลี้ยบ, seems to be stir-fried minced pork with olive vegetables? It goes very well with rice!
- In the second image, the fried oyster omelet, similar to the fried oyster omelet from Taiwan's Shilin Night Market.
- In the second image, the seasonal limited drink, longan tea.
- In the second image, the most special dish, curry crab \(Panang Curry\), made with a whole fresh crab.

> _The goose brand cooling paste recommended by Thais; I later bought a jar that smells smoother than the mint nasal stick and has less nasal irritation!_

#### 20:00 [The Rock Pub](https://www.instagram.com/therockpub/){:target="_blank"}

After eating, I headed to The Rock Pub for drinks and live music.

All four performances were rock and classic old songs!

I heard songs from: Coldplay, Radiohead, Kings of Leon, Arcade Fire, Oasis, The Killers…

I took a Grab to [Wang Chun Sheng Beef Hot Pot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1VuwzAdKS4vH6kmj6){:target="_blank"} for breakfast. The overall flavor is quite Chinese/Taiwanese, which I think is good, but Tainan beef soup is even better.

> _After eating, I planned to go to Chatuchak Market, which is a bit far, so I didn’t want to walk and transfer to BTS, so I took an Uber directly \(THB 374\)._

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*0ofswmspB9w2vM7mII57_g.jpeg)

Chatuchak is a large area with dense vendors, but overall it is clean and easy to navigate. However, many items are repetitive, and it seems like a lot of them are touristy Made In China products.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GJv4mk3v2-DptRofTF_9zg.jpeg)

In the end, I only bought a Thai brand, Phutawan indoor diffuser, as a souvenir.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*28EbS8N3OUJwSCPrgaTb8Q.png)

After getting tired from shopping, I went into a massage shop inside for a foot massage + some shoulder and neck massage. \(1 hour/THB 250\)
#### Restroom

If you need to use the restroom at Chatuchak, there are paid restrooms outside the market \(THB 5 per use\). I went in and found it very clean, with one stall per person, and they are basically cleaned all the time; if you don’t want to pay, you can go to the nearby [Mixt Chatuchak](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5PwQcFThBHtFpbzw6){:target="_blank"} mall, which has free and equally clean restrooms.

After eating, I continued to explore and bought a cup of durian juice to drink, which had a very rich and authentic flavor and was reasonably priced \(THB 89\).

> _Later, I found that things at Chatuchak are actually cheaper; for example, the mint nasal sticks here sell 6 for $99, while Big C sells 6 for $140… and the durian juice is also cheaper; it sells for over $140 at night markets in the city._

#### 15:00 Take BTS to King Power Mahanakhon

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*A4V3CL5XvLoQ4sp487pJuQ.jpeg)

Chatuchak is closer to the MRT, but the King Power building we want to go to is at BTS Chong Nonsi Station; it takes about 1 KM \(15 mins\) to walk from Chatuchak to the nearest BTS Saphan Khwai Station.
#### King Power Mahanakhon (Bangkok's King Power Mahanakhon)

Ticket price: THB 1,080 per person

> _Before taking the elevator, you can choose whether to take photos \(the ticket includes a series of free digital photos; if you want physical photos, you have to pay extra\)._

The direct elevator has a 360-degree scene animation similar to Taipei 101 and the Tokyo Skytree; the height is about the same as Tokyo Tower.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*sP_hQ4hGSKCygeaSgltHpQ.jpeg)

The elevator first takes you to the indoor observation deck on the 74th floor, where there is a café and public seating for a short rest. To reach the outdoor observation deck on the 78th floor, you need to transfer to another elevator or take the stairs.

As soon as you arrive on the 78th floor, there is a small bar where you can order a drink and enjoy the view.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*PeqjUWSwE1Hh24qWkioTxA.png)

After exiting the 78th floor, you can continue up the stairs to the rest area on the top floor.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dFRAU2mY_Qp9T0ru4GngIg.jpeg)

From the top floor, you can enjoy a panoramic view of Bangkok, and one can imagine that the night view must be beautiful as well!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*f4eREu0dL79OzsYCtl1O9A.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XOsqBu8PjCeB7XSlsD0_Fg.jpeg)

The stairs and the rest area on the top floor face the famous transparent glass corridor, where you can see straight down to the ground. You can grab shoe covers from the nearby box to enter, but **it is prohibited to bring mobile phones; you can ask your companions or staff for help in taking photos.**

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*K2MOcxsrNbuNbz00sPfNOg.png)

The entire glass corridor is not very large, about the size of a rooftop infinity pool at a hotel. It doesn't feel very high when viewed from the side, but actually walking on it can be a bit scary, making your legs feel weak XD.

### Ratchada Night Market (formerly known as Ratchada Train Night Market)

![You can swipe your credit card directly at the MRT](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*BrfghHaJknyt6IiX7yOgbA.jpeg)

You can swipe your credit card directly at the MRT.

To get to Central Rama 9, you need to transfer to the MRT subway at Pharam 9 Station. The Rabbit Card cannot be used, so you need to buy a ticket or you can now use a VISA card to swipe in and out.

> _I tested the Taishin GoGo card, and it works; I haven't tried the Cathay Cube._

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*c6Ug9F-JfXPzgnfvtvRvdg.jpeg)

For dinner, we came here to find food. I must say that Bangkok's night markets and markets are far superior to those in Taiwan. The overall environment is clean, there are seating areas, it’s not chaotic, and it’s well-planned, making it very comfortable to stroll around.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1cBlgC7kvmt1fWeMfiDVMA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OVMfzMU1HugpE0CVyUiSVw.jpeg)

After walking around, we first tried the dessert on the left (similar to egg cake?) and the savory seafood grill on the right. Both were chewy and quite good.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*31mIDWp4WgTX8TSK5Q-C4Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*K3ZN-Kiwz4yTiNHiZ3P1bg.jpeg)

Next up was the main event: volcanic ribs. The flavor was quite unique, with a sauce that had a lemongrass and spicy taste. You can just put on gloves and grab them to eat, which is very appetizing!

After eating, we bought coconut ice cream with mango and peanut dessert from other stalls, which was also delicious!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GamIzqKB9ROnECRfhPfA1Q.jpeg)

After eating, we went back to Central Rama 9 to take a look. There is also the famous NaRaYa Bangkok bag here.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*a5BcYS64yitoccK9TTU1HQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*csaO0X3lGf2TSIb3xQ8JWg.jpeg)

On the way back to the hotel, we happened to encounter Bangkok after the rain, with colorful digital advertising screens. The color contrast was intense, giving a very cyberpunk feel.

#### 7–11 Hot Pressed Toast Late Night Snack

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*xQi9q1iA7o6FyfAeEISTEw.jpeg)

On the way back to the hotel, I tried Thailand's [hot pressed toast from convenience stores](https://supertaste.tvbs.com.tw/pack/347495){:target="_blank"} along with Thai banana milk. The filling was melted cheese with a hot dog, and the crust was flaky! It was really delicious and cheap!

### 8/05 Day 4 Central World, Big C, Terminal 21

> **_Did not sleep well all night + hungover all day, feeling a bit dazed._**

#### Central World

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8pZ3crfkb4wIqZZOoI9-zA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6_evilQk4T0LdCYSIgBudg.jpeg)

In the morning, I got up and headed out to Central World for shopping.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Sp3TTqnEx3yn6IM4H38NsQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*tmLvijY5Q7TVJbMo4D4XFg.jpeg)

On the first floor, there is a SHAKE SHACK burger. It was my first time trying it, so I ordered the SHAKE SHACK signature burger and the coconut milkshake flavor that is unique to Bangkok. The burger was delicious and not greasy, but I found the milkshake a bit too sweet.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OXOp4dN-5p9xS1ojcu0b9A.jpeg)

The inside is quite large, and just like ICONSIAM, if you want to explore it thoroughly, you won't finish in a day... I just casually bought a shirt.

#### Big C

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*JNswfx_h01UuffS299HjgQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GWD-HcYbLfAQEAN99tErsw.jpeg)

After shopping at Central World, I walked across to Big C to buy snacks and souvenirs. (There are many options, but I didn't find them cheaper...)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Bda3BGHI_ZeylIS96UNcWg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*DWtvvjZ3iAwk5U3MPZDudg.jpeg)

![Bottom left: Phutawan indoor diffuser was bought yesterday at Chatuchak, but I guess it can also be found in department stores in the city.](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*aMillKlyevVx8fDncaurSA.png)

The bottom left Phutawan indoor diffuser was bought yesterday at Chatuchak, but I guess it can also be found in department stores in the city.

Additionally, Big C seems to no longer provide plastic bags, so you have to buy an eco-friendly bag in the store.

> _That big bag of dried durian actually only has two small bags inside... but it's quite tasty._

#### Lunch

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*z4VW1WOelH7UjBco9PIAqg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*qWWrZXa_LRClqCTi7bZK3Q.png)

The outdoor plaza of Central World had a food market event. It wasn't just a simple setup with tents and stalls; it had a theme, and this time it was Titanic. You could enter for free by following their official YouTube channel; the decorations inside were also very exquisite.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*9iurlEySgDL-ZQZzVGDiug.jpeg)

But for lunch, we went back to SHAKE SHACK again, this time trying the chicken thigh burger, which was just as delicious.

#### Afternoon: Returned to the hotel for a nap because I didn’t sleep well + hungover… I was really tired.

#### Dinner at Terminal 21 Shopping Mall

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8_lDD7yaIYIq7HV4zG4ClA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1T7njk_JYMi1eP1oMbjH-w.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*giNbQ1GPda-qPFaA8yQ7sQ.jpeg)

Terminal 21 is also a place where you can shop endlessly. Each floor has a different regional theme; for example, the Japan floor mainly sells Japanese products and restaurants.

I mainly met up with [Chun-Hsiu Liu](https://medium.com/u/72361fccaa43){:target="_blank"} at the food court upstairs for a meal. ( **A cheap and delicious dining spot that I highly recommend!** )

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ZyuBXqyjZtLw5zyVmarw6w.png)

At the food court, you find your own seat, and many locals come here to eat as well.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*a4MnqcM5Bi9jRPC3T29s5A.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*sYc87mPtI1nf3-9pk_F13w.png)

> _⚠️ **The payment method here is that the vendors do not collect money directly. You need to go to the counter to exchange cash for a food card, and you pay with the QR code on the food card; after eating, return to the counter for a refund. (No deposit or handling fee required)**_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*rt81B-Pc31OZeMlgG5M38Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*k1vmadbwhdJsJNmkllarLQ.jpeg)

There are many choices; just line up, tell them your number, and pay with the food card QR code; you can also take out (I remember there’s an additional THB 10 packaging fee).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Ol8uiQNEnE9tuZc-qbgqgQ.jpeg)

I ordered seafood fried instant noodles (THB 50) + pork chop with fries (THB 59) = THB 109.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t2R762mSI8CeoDWpSAuEKg.jpeg)

After eating, I also took a box of mango sticky rice as a late-night snack to enjoy back at the hotel.

It was really delicious and cheap!!! A meal at a restaurant outside usually starts at THB 200–300, while here, most meals are around THB 50–80.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*G4G79vwVWj592tOApWbK2g.jpeg)

After eating, I went to the back to stroll around [Benjakitti Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bmKhQpbw9KTtLYeN8){:target="_blank"} and look for the legendary [Bangkok Monitor Lizard](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%B7%A8%E8%9C%A5%E4%BD%94%E9%A0%98%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8-%E8%A2%AB%E5%B0%81%E6%B3%B0%E7%89%88%E4%BE%8F%E7%BE%8E%E5%9C%92-104942584.html){:target="_blank"}; perhaps because it was night, I didn’t see a single one.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dMZhzj3rAqhRWAVuxeS0XQ.jpeg)

Back at the hotel, my travel companion bought some mangosteen to taste. I found the fresh ones delicious, with a light sweetness combined with the flavor of the mangosteen, very smooth. Later, I tried dried mangosteen, which didn’t taste as good; it was dry and sour.

> **_As for durians, the prices in Bangkok are not cheaper... a whole one is still THB 200 – 300._**

### 8/06 Day 5 Return Trip
#### Bangkok Monitor Lizard

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*E0M71hXTtQmzl2YP6kgPtw.jpeg)

In the morning, I was not discouraged and specially went to [Lumphini Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n53FhsjXUUJLnghn6){:target="_blank"} to look for the legendary Bangkok Monitor Lizard. Due to time constraints, I only found one medium-sized lizard that had just come out to bask in the sun.

> _Looking for the monitor lizard was just a personal whim of mine; it is said that locals really dislike these lizards (water monitor lizards) because they eat dirty things, so it’s best not to touch them._

#### 12:00 Back to the hotel to pick up luggage and head to the airport

My flight is at 15:20, so I need to leave by noon. It takes about an hour from the city center to the airport.

The Grab fare from the hotel was THB 577, and we needed to get on the highway; the driver paid the toll first, and the final Grab card charge would include the toll fee. (I remember it was about THB 50.)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ENH0G1_tBNWy-8RHV9XCag.jpeg)

The checked baggage limit was only 15 kg, and I managed to stick to it.

After clearing immigration around 13:20, the security checks at Bangkok airport were quite strict; everything had to go through security, and carry-on bags almost all had to be opened for manual inspection.

After going through customs and security, I had about an hour to grab a bite to eat; I found a Thai restaurant for my last meal in Thailand. \(Seafood fried rice, mango juice, mango sticky rice\).

> _Many shops sell mango sticky rice in takeout boxes after leaving the country, so if you don't have enough, you can buy some to eat on the plane!_

> _**\(⚠️ But remember, it's prohibited to bring it back to Taiwan ⚠️\)**_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ouwulscC2q0OsIujIa2iXg.jpeg)

This bottle of water deserves a close-up because the budget airline didn't provide anything, and I thought I could buy water at the airport. However, after going through customs, bottled water costs THB 70 — 100, and this one was THB 100.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*rOoff9qAZL6L4LjXH4DNfw.jpeg)

BKK is huge... filled with Trip\.com advertisements. My return flight was on time, so I took the shuttle bus to the terminal.
#### Back to Taiwan

Arriving at TPE Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, I collected my luggage and left around 20:45, heading straight to catch the `1841` or `1819` Kuo-Kuang Motor Transport bus back to Taipei, which was very convenient without needing to transfer.
### ⚠️ Safety and Precautions for Traveling in Bangkok, Thailand ⚠️

The most important thing when going out is safety, so I've compiled a list of safety tips and precautions.
#### Scam Prevention

[![The Eight Most Common Scams When Traveling in Thailand, Some Still Catching People!](/assets/b7e7c0938985/07b5_hqdefault.jpg "The Eight Most Common Scams When Traveling in Thailand, Some Still Catching People!")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o42r-bg16Fg){:target="_blank"}

The following summary is based on a video by Bangkok Cat. I personally encountered a currency exchange scam during this trip.
1. Incorrect calculations
Not necessarily intentional; you can calculate the total amount when ordering.
2. Someone approaches you wanting to see your country's currency or asking if you want to exchange money
They might steal or pickpocket when you take out your wallet.
3. Outside the Grand Palace or attractions, someone falsely claims the site is closed and enthusiastically suggests taking a tuk-tuk to other places \(black temples/black shops/ **private boat rides, I encountered this at the pier** \) to scam you into spending.
4. Tuk-tuks, outrageous prices, suddenly increasing fares halfway through
If you want to experience a tuk-tuk but are afraid of being overcharged, [you can try the new MUVMI app for tuk-tuk rides](https://bkk.com.tw/muvmi-app/){:target="_blank"}.
Even if a tuk-tuk looks good, be wary of scam 3, where they enthusiastically suggest attractions or boat rides.
5. Fake staff members will enthusiastically lure you in while waiting in line, using your language to describe the menu and take your order, then say you need to pay upfront and run off with your money.
6. Motorcycle or scooter rental scams
Do not leave your passport as a deposit, do not leave your passport as a deposit, do not leave your passport as a deposit.
If you encounter malicious scams claiming damage and asking for compensation, leaving your passport can be troublesome. It's better to rent from reputable chain rental companies and take a video of the vehicle's condition before renting.
7. Local dating app scams
You might end up meeting a ladyboy, a scammer, or worse.
8. Patpong ping pong show scams, where enthusiastic touts ask if you want to see a ping pong show, claiming you only need to buy a 100 THB drink, then lead you into a dark alley or a shady second-floor establishment.
It's hard to leave, and when you want to go, they demand 3,000 THB, claiming there's no such thing as a 100 THB drink.
9. Be cautious of pickpockets in crowded places, even in areas where you need to buy tickets to enter \(e.g., Grand Palace, Wat Pho\).

#### 🌿🚬

Next year it will be banned, but I can share some experiences.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️ Edibles (like gummies) are very potent, and the scary part is that when you eat them, they feel just like regular gummies, and the effects can hit you suddenly after a few hours ⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- It's best to try gradually, eat 1/3... wait a few hours... nothing happens, then eat 2/3... wait a few hours... feel a little something, then try eating one whole...
- Smoking should also be gradual based on your tolerance.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️ Regardless, I strongly recommend trying it only in your hotel; if you get high, you can rest directly, which is safer ⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- Just because you drink doesn't mean you have a higher tolerance.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️** Your heart rate may increase and feel uncomfortable **⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- It's safer to have someone sober around to take care of you if needed.
- Only smoke in specific situations.

#### Other
- Thailand is not a tipping culture; generally, you don't need to tip. I only tip THB 20 for massages as a gesture.
- Alcohol can only be sold from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM and from 5:00 PM to midnight; it's prohibited all day on Buddhist holidays.
- Not all hotel balconies allow smoking, so ask first.
- The emergency hotline for foreigners is `1155`.
- SuperRich has business hours, so if you arrive too early or too late, you won't be able to exchange money.

[_On the way from Bangkok to Hua Hin, you must pass through the Seven Rock area, where there is a Greek-themed "Santorini Amusement Park," a popular spot for Thai families to stroll on weekends. If you love taking photos, I highly recommend visiting this incredibly romantic park._ www\.bring\-you\.info](https://www.bring-you.info/zh-tw/santorini-park){:target="_blank"}

It seems like a small amusement park with Greek-style scenery.
#### [Hua Hin Artist Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UcF7Wd82aHq4aGP86){:target="_blank"}

A quite famous attraction, still open in 2024.

The hotel is in a villa style, with each room being a standalone unit. The swimming pool surrounds all the rooms, and there's a bar by the pool; the beach outside is undeveloped and desolate.

After dinner, we went to a nearby night market.
### Day 3
#### [Maeklong Railway Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Jsbm5FFwYf2ArEW36){:target="_blank"}

It was too early, and everyone gave up on going.
#### [Damnoen Saduak Floating Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tKSTmHgaHc4YCbpZ6){:target="_blank"}

I remember it being quite thrilling, with an adventurous feel, even though the water was murky and had a smell.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*qy7YBGcWTMfpItXtapHr9g.jpeg)

The guide specifically told the staff not to step on my back. I remember it being very high-end, but it was painful during the massage, and I couldn't sleep XD.
#### [River City Shopping Complex](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L3Pnv1BpLCpcGs7G7){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7tYE57IoZUXg1gQhWuSa8g.jpeg)

Since we were going to the Chao Phraya Princess cruise + buffet dinner that night, we first stopped by the nearby shopping mall.
#### Chao Phraya Princess Cruise Buffet Dinner

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*EEELplqEfG3bLcGUoLAvRQ.jpeg)

I remember the food being decent, but the main highlight was the beautiful night view, where you could see the lights of the Bangkok [Riverside Night Market Ferris Wheel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/evFHo6ciFY4jswSt9){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6pzhTRcjRh_b6Z4jOJH_fg.jpeg)

After returning to the hotel, we went to the bar on the Marriott rooftop for a drink. I just remember the night view being beautiful and the drinks being cheap.
### Day 4 Free Day

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*NU2LiyNLR8lgf7phtPYKHg.jpeg)

I only remember going shopping at the mall, Big C, and Central World.
#### In the evening, we went to [Zoom Sky Bar at Anantara Sathorn Bangkok Hotel](https://www.kkday.com/zh-hk/product/105589-zoom-sky-bar-anantara-sathorn-bangkok-package?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} for drinks.

### Day 5 Return Trip

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*SpSAMDAk7Pp7SSCrmCyBQQ.jpeg)

This concludes the memories from the 2018 employee trip. This time, returning to Bangkok for a fully free trip made me more familiar with the city. Compared to my previous visit, I feel it has become more prosperous, the food is better, and prices have increased since then.
