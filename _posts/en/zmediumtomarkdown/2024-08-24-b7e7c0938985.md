### \[Travel Diary\] 2024 Bangkok, Thailand 🇹🇭 5-Day Free Trip

Returning to Thailand after the pandemic for a quick five-day trip to Bangkok.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*kRZZjY_7_6WaKRkw9E74iw.jpeg)

#### Memories of Bangkok

Let's rewind to 2018, when I went on my first company trip after entering the workforce, and my first time abroad was to Bangkok, Thailand (5 days). The following year, in 2019, I joined a company trip to Sabah. Then came the two years stolen by the pandemic, and after it ended, I started going crazy with trips to Japan.

Back then, I was a total newbie with zero social experience, blindly following my older siblings on outings. I didn't even know what I could or couldn't bring on a plane. At security, I foolishly placed my passport on top of the basket, and when I got it back from the machine, I found it had fallen onto the conveyor belt, nearly giving me a heart attack (if it had fallen into a gap, I wouldn't have been able to return). That trip was mindless group travel, and I don't have a clear impression of Bangkok; I only remember that the rooftop bars were great, the weather was hot, things were cheap, and massages were affordable—nothing more, and I had no concept of geography.

Thus, I always thought about returning to Bangkok to revisit old memories from six years ago. However, I wasn't familiar with Southeast Asia and was hesitant to travel alone. **So, at the beginning of the year, while chatting with colleagues from Pinkoi, we decided to plan this five-day free trip to Bangkok.**

> _Details and memories from the 2018 Bangkok + Hua Hin five-day trip are included in the appendix at the end of this article._

Since I started a new job in June, I wasn't really focused on leisure activities. Mark and Sean were mainly responsible for the arrangements and planning, so I didn't do much research.

#### Internet

This time, the preparation was rushed, and I hadn't set up my internet until the day before. I didn't have time to buy my usual physical SIM card, so I was fortunate to try eSIM for the first time. (I fell in love with it!)

I bought the [**Thailand SIM Card | AIS 5G High-Speed Internet 8 Days Unlimited Data + Calls eSIM**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} directly from KKday, and after purchasing, I received the eSIM activation certificate right away, so I could use it immediately.

![[Thailand SIM Card | AIS 5G High-Speed Internet 8 Days Unlimited Data + Calls eSIM](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*AnowISXXahXxykkUUsugFw.png)

[Thailand SIM Card | AIS 5G High-Speed Internet 8 Days Unlimited Data + Calls eSIM](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}
- Limited-time promotional offer: From now until December 31, 2024, activating during the promotional period allows you to enjoy double high-speed data from 15GB to 30GB. After exceeding 30GB, the speed will drop to 384 Kbps, but you will remain connected.
- Unlimited calls within the AIS network and a 50 THB call allowance. When using the following apps for text messaging, you can use an additional 10GB of data (10Mbps): TikTok, WeChat, and Instagram.
- **Has a physical number, can make calls, and receive SMS!**
- Days are calculated on a 24-hour basis, starting from the activation of the eSIM, with 24 hours counting as one day (Thailand time).

[It's mainly all-you-can-eat and cheaper than a physical SIM card, costing NT $232 for 8 days.](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}
#### Flight 🛫
- Outbound: TPE 16:00 -> BKK 18:45
- Return: BKK 15:20 -> TPE 20:10

Airline: Thai VietJet Air (Low-cost carrier)

Price: `TWD $9,259` (including an additional **15 kg** checked baggage)

Initially, I thought it would be better to travel with everyone. My friend didn't check in any luggage (the ticket price was around `$6,000`), but later I checked other airlines and felt I missed out; other airlines had similar prices around `$10,000`, which wasn't much different, but much more comfortable!

Thai VietJet Air's baggage policy allows you not to check in luggage; you can carry two pieces of hand luggage, with a total weight not exceeding 7 kg.
```
1. Hand luggage weight:
Each passenger (excluding infants) can bring 1 piece of their own luggage and 1 small hand luggage, with a maximum total weight not exceeding 7 kg.

2. Hand luggage dimensions:
- 01 piece of hand luggage with maximum dimensions of 56cm x 36cm x 23cm.
- 01 piece of small hand luggage (including the following bags):
  + 01 girl's bag, magazines, camera, baby food bag, and bags purchased at the airport not exceeding 30cm x 20cm x 10cm.
  + 01 bag for a jacket that, when opened, does not exceed 114cm x 60cm x 11cm.
  + 01 bag for a laptop with maximum dimensions of 40cm x 30cm x 10cm.
```

> [_Information as of 2024/08/22, everything is subject to the latest official announcements._](https://www.vietjetair.com/zh-TW/pages/%E8%A1%8C%E6%9D%8E%E8%A6%8F%E5%AE%9A-1607068164219){:target="_blank"} 

Basically, just carry a backpack and drag a carry-on suitcase.
#### Flight Change Notification on 8/1

### 8/02 Day 1 Departure
#### Departing from home around 12:30 PM

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*YsFObRlulrMFKHySvo3NAw.jpeg)

> _Remember to take the direct train to the airport; the regular train, even if it’s in the morning, won’t get you there faster than the direct train!_ 

#### Arriving at Taoyuan Airport Terminal 1 around 13:30

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*BBE4RhKU9tcJI427_LoQMw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ksagRFmStL9nLBWIyYY3Jg.png)

There was no one at the check-in counter, so I checked in and completed the baggage drop-off immediately.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GI5u8vhrNRbFdG-XqY_2LQ.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*CBOJ0KHI4dMmAP5REh1UaA.jpeg)

Again, it was B1R, the farthest corner with a shuttle bus to the boarding gate.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XMQJOe1n5vyVdWQrYJpgNg.png)

With plenty of time before my 4 PM flight, I went to eat at 鼎呱呱 again. This time I discovered that I could order just the chicken, which used to only be sold as fried chicken!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*hfpWAbwiM2Aal3MZJ36oOA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XNjYtycibxeowQBaDT_jNw.jpeg)

I also found out that if you walk further from 鼎呱呱, you can go directly to Terminal 2, so if you have time, you can walk to Terminal 2 for food; or Terminal 2 can come to Terminal 1 for the free VIP lounge XD.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t4dk8GQIv0D53N0V_qo7KA.png)

After buying 鼎呱呱, I went to the free VIP lounge in Terminal 1 to relax and eat. This time I saw someone charging their devices; [last time I came, all the outlets were taken, but it seems they have fixed it](../cb65fd5ab770/) (?).
#### Around 15:30, heading to B1R waiting area

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*2Ros8CQBKj0-kkMugSZ7Hg.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*At7elbjIueB9lvvenvlfTA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*fpzrwzWez_HwgKFuFmDAhA.png)

I don't know if it's because it's a low-cost airline, but the information wasn't updated (it kept showing 16:00, but it had actually changed to 16:35).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*puKndBRQgCKs3LKbXbzEWw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*zCT2uidCELNc7WL1NpW72Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1aGwmjed9srQtHli3uDoxg.jpeg)

With the flight delayed, the actual departure time was 17:13.
- VietJet's seats are about the same size as Tigerair's, larger than Peach Aviation's, but the seats are uncomfortable; the leather material isn't breathable, and sitting for too long can be painful.
- VietJet seems to allow you to eat your own food; on the return flight, someone brought mango sticky rice to eat, and it was fine.
```

#### 19:30 Arrival at Bangkok BKK Suvarnabhumi Airport

I learned from my colleagues that if you arrive at Bangkok Airport during peak hours, you can purchase the [**Thailand Airport BKK Departure Meet and Greet Fast Track Service**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/160605?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} for quick customs clearance XD. However, since we arrived at this time, there were almost only people from our flight, so the customs process was very quick.
#### 20:00 Baggage Claim and Exiting the Airport

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*QDvOtf4PsS-jSESOkb-0AA.jpeg)

Perhaps due to the low-cost airline, there weren't many people checking in luggage, and baggage claim was super fast.
#### eSIM Network Setup

As soon as I exited the airport, I started figuring out how to set up and activate the eSIM, only to find out that...

> **_⚠️ Activating eSIM requires an internet connection ⚠️_** 

> **_⚠️ Activating eSIM requires an internet connection ⚠️_** 

> **_⚠️ Activating eSIM requires an internet connection ⚠️_** 

It's a bit like buying a pair of scissors but needing another pair to cut open the packaging; activating the eSIM requires an internet connection. Luckily, a friend traveling with me had already activated his eSIM in Taiwan, so I borrowed his internet to activate mine. \(The airport also has Wi-Fi available, so there's no need to worry too much\)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*_xv7JB_yl7d47ljrUTpYdw.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6vg_zfmf6tr3SIBUj6gi4A.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7-7yMcMgwbpNzBq1YgknaQ.png)

To find the eSIM activation, simply long-press the QR code and select "Add eSIM."

> **_I don't know why, but if you save the QR code to photos or notes, you lose the quick add feature. Another method is to send the QR code to a travel companion or print it out for your phone to scan._** 

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*hZBZoEJCLuHxEgbOVMEXBw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*_MctPE8uZYOdX5vnYoJnvg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*KMKLtNg2Aaeug_cn5fitNQ.jpeg)

Manual setup path for iPhone iOS eSIM: Settings -> Cellular -> Add eSIM -> Scan QR Code -> Manually enter information -> Input the information from the email -> Use as... You can select "Travel" -> Choose "Travel" for mobile data -> Done!

Once activated, it’s like having dual SIMs, but the original SIM card won’t have internet unless you purchase a roaming plan. **In case of emergency, you can switch back to the original SIM card!**
- [For AIS, dial *545# to check your phone number, *121# to check your balance, and *121*3# to check your data](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}

#### 20:30 Finding Food at the Airport

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*mDPRItCdp28u5P6tTQelqQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*bgHNI9p20Jyf3t3IMDExMQ.jpeg)

Since it would take over an hour to get to the city and hotel, and the low-cost airline doesn’t provide meals, everyone was quite hungry, so we decided to grab dinner at the airport.

We found a Thai restaurant and had some spicy stir-fried minced pork, which was deliciously spicy, paired with vegetable soup to help ease the heat.
#### 21:00 Moving to the Hotel

> _👉👉👉 You can refer to KKday's airport transfer service:_ 

> _[\- Thailand | Airport Private Transfer | Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) / Don Mueang Airport (DMK) — Bangkok/Pattaya/Hua Hin City Hotels](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/3431-bkk-or-dmk-bangkok-private-transfer?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*cagHOMc-TKS9fmhN18zVOQ.png)

After eating, around 21:00, we started moving towards the city and our hotel.

**Taking public transport requires three transfers between the subway and BTS:**
1. Airport Rail Link `Suvarnabhumi` -> `Phaya Thai`
2. BTS Sukhumvit Line `Phaya Thai` -> `Siam`
3. BTS Silom Line `Siam` -> `Chong Nonsi`

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OvL8K9OxwjMCVJ-3hYy2bw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*-eJ_rrYns2teWCITXTnhTA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*PeWlfQ6fd55mU1Ojk0isJQ.png)

- The Airport Rail Link only allows ticket purchases.
- You can buy a Rabbit Card (BTS transportation card) at the ticket window for top-ups and swipe in and out of the stations.
- Please note that the **Rabbit Card can only be used on the BTS**, not on the MRT or Airport Rail Link.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*EF3IK_FXS4n3igDOsJ0C4A.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*jY4Jg6_vGhAM5CjPrVM-Iw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Dom8OdbMSRAAXtFpykCTZQ.png)

- Arrived at `Chong Nonsi` (later I found out that the King Power MahaNakhon building is at this station!)

#### Walking to [JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL](https://jckevin.com/){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6VrvZBTlo2gjg_lY7oQG8w.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*cgv3HGHsAkH8WL_jA6qTsg.jpeg)

When exiting the BTS, don’t rush down the overpass; you can walk across the road from the overpass.

> **_I felt it was quite dark along the way (not many streetlights), and it was a bit far to walk (15 mins / 1 KM). It could be quite scary to walk alone at night._** _Along the way, I passed a 7-Eleven and a small night market, where I bought some snacks to take back to the hotel._ 

> _Also, if you take a taxi, due to the two-way road and U-turn issues, the driver has to go past the hotel a bit to the next gap to turn back, which is a bit of a hassle._ 

#### 10:30 Arrival at JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL

Arrived at the hotel around 10:30.

[![JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL](/assets/b7e7c0938985/43d8_hqdefault.jpg "JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg24V_VS6oA){:target="_blank"}

The room is very spacious, like a whole apartment, with a master bedroom, a second bedroom, two bathrooms, a kitchen, a living room, and a balcony.
#### Memories from 2018

Taken in 2018 / iPhone 6

What a coincidence! During the staff trip to Bangkok in 2018, everyone took a taxi to the rooftop bar at this hotel XD.

Additionally, they also offer a Sky Bar dinner package:

#### 2024

Since I’m staying here, after dropping off my luggage in the room, I went up to take a look.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*h8ksUQqToXHPTda_RnwkSg.jpeg)

Since it was already past dinner time, I could only order some snacks and skewers.
### 8/03 Day 2 Wat Pho, Grand Palace, Wat Phra Kaew, Wat Arun, ICONSIAM, Lhao Lhao, Rock Pub Live
#### Hotel Breakfast

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7m7nqO5Q1kdTTPQsdx9TWg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t1xva8yggECe94znx32pew.jpeg)

After finishing breakfast at the hotel, I headed out. I thought the breakfast was okay, but there weren't many options.
#### 9:30 Departure

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*A2zezLiqIEOngnuebgxUjA.jpeg)

Since there were many of us, we took a Grab (THB 135) directly to Wat Pho.

On the way, we passed through [Chinatown](https://www.kkday.com/zh-hk/blog/101689/bangkokchinatown?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}, but I forgot to take a photo; it had a very cyberpunk vibe!

You need to take off your shoes to enter, and you can walk around the Reclining Buddha to pay your respects.
#### SuperRich Currency Exchange

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GKVidaEFygfEMNjfKFNweA.jpeg)

After leaving Wat Pho, I thought I should address the currency exchange issue first. Only one friend had exchanged some Thai Baht in advance; the others planned to exchange in Bangkok. So we walked to the nearby [The Old Siam Shopping Plaza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UPNxgoTmtswuhHVS8){:target="_blank"} to exchange money at SuperRich.

**⚠️ Please note: The Taiwanese dollars you want to exchange must be free of stains, markings, etc., or they will be rejected for exchange. \(I happened to have a thousand-dollar bill from an ATM in Taiwan that had a pencil mark on it and was rejected for exchange\)**

> _NTD $5,000 exchanged for THB $5,200_

Khanom bueang Thai Pancake

After exchanging money, we had cash, so we replenished our energy at the food market on the first floor; I had a sweet Thai pancake \(ขนมเบื้อง\) filled with meringue, which was very sweet and tasted like cotton candy, along with a banana pancake; finally, I bought an iced coffee to continue our journey.
#### Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew

Entrance fee: THB 500/person.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*NVu8tXAG7D3sGNRQi-PHGw.jpeg)

Around 13:00, after exiting the Grand Palace, we found a Western restaurant nearby towards the pier to have lunch.
#### 14:00 Preparing to Take the Boat to Wat Arun

> **_⚠️ There will be people outside the pier trying to solicit you, be careful as they may be private boat operators charging high fees (THB 500, 1000) and may not be safe; just ignore them and find the official pier and counter to tell them where you want to go. ⚠️_** 

> **_The official ticket price is only THB 30 \(_** _`Tha Chang` **to Wat Arun\), and the new boats have air conditioning, making them safe and comfortable.**_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ccUJ7WKGfb73k8UWEDNesg.jpeg)

When the boat arrives, the staff will announce "Wat Arun" (yes, in Chinese), and you can always ask if you're unsure.

The time is approaching afternoon, and a thunderstorm is on the way; you can see the water flow is muddy and rapid.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8hMHmiUOANTISYOVpTISiA.jpeg)

The boat is very new, the air conditioning is cool, and it's safely enclosed. There are also quite a few departures, making it very convenient!

When you arrive, the staff will also announce "Wat Arun."

#### 14:30 Arrive at Wat Arun

Ticket price: THB 200

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ujWr_UkXTX__M2jEz06sUw.jpeg)

After disembarking, you will be at Wat Arun, where you can directly queue to buy tickets for entry.

> **_⚠️ There is also a dress code at Wat Arun ⚠️_** 

> **_No bare shoulders, shorts, exposed midriffs, or short skirts._** 

> **_You can wear traditional Thai clothing; many people wear it for photos._**

After the visit, return to the pier and find the ticket booth \(PIER 2\) to buy a ticket for the boat to ICONSIAM \(THB 40\), then head to PIER 1 to board.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*MbiMV91xnwXQqSTg4UUx1g.jpeg)

ICONSIAM is very large and looks luxurious, with a unique food court on the first floor.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*eLZgR_Wmmnt0oWkwO-d-KQ.jpeg)

I bought a cup of ChaTraMue hand-brewed Thai milk tea to recharge.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*P-p65azTMpWowyRbZuyxhQ.png)

I strolled all the way to the BTS Charoen Nakhon platform, thinking of getting a foot massage for an hour.

There was a newer, larger place \(1\) THAI GARDEN MASSAGE outside the station, but they were fully booked; fortunately, I continued walking to \(2\) another massage shop, as shown in the picture. I found it very comfortable, less crowded, spacious, and quieter, with a cheap rate \(foot/1 hour/THB 270\).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*s6--mVkXnO3wqrcTHRgL0Q.png)

After the massage, I had the energy to continue shopping and returned to ICONSIAM; I walked all the way to the upstairs restaurant, which was also quite extravagant, featuring a jungle, small bridges, flowing water, and waterfalls. Overall, it was very nice!

> _I bought the famous Japanese fries, TORO FRIES \(the line was long\) to recharge._ 

> _They also have Japan's % coffee here._ 

#### Head to LHAO LHAO for dinner

This line is a branch with only three stations and less frequent service.

> _Google Maps seems to lack information about this BTS line; it suggested I walk to Krung Thon Buri._ 

From here, taking one stop to Krung Thon Buri connects to the Silom Line.

At Siam, I switched to the Sukhumvit Line and got off at Ari Station, which is a short walk to LHAO LHAO restaurant.

The owner seems to be Chinese? It feels like a fusion of Chinese and Thai cuisine, a highly-rated old restaurant, and apparently a favorite of Blackpink's Lisa.

Since I was heading to a pub to listen to live music later, I ate a bit quickly, but I found every dish delicious!!
- In the first three images, the background is the refreshing goose brand paste, the one that looks like minced meat is called หมูสับผัดหนำเลี้ยบ, which seems to be stir-fried minced meat with olive vegetables? It goes well with rice!
- In the second image, the fried oyster omelet is similar to the fried oyster omelet from the Shilin Night Market in Taiwan.
- In the second image, the seasonal limited drink is longan tea.
- In the second image, the most special dish is the crab curry \(Panang Curry\), which is made with a whole fresh crab.

> _The goose brand refreshing paste recommended by Thais; I later bought a jar that smells smoother than a menthol nasal stick and is less irritating to the nasal cavity!_ 

#### 20:00 [The Rock Pub](https://www.instagram.com/therockpub/){:target="_blank"}

After eating, I headed to The Rock Pub for drinks and live music.

Four bands performed, all playing rock and classic old songs!

I recognized songs from: Coldplay, Radiohead, Kings of Leon, Arcade Fire, Oasis, The Killers…

Cat magnet, there are many cats in Bangkok, and they immediately come to rub against me.

Early in the morning, I took a Grab to [Wang Chun Sheng Beef Hot Pot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1VuwzAdKS4vH6kmj6){:target="_blank"} for breakfast. The overall flavor is quite Chinese/Taiwanese, and I think it's good, but Tainan beef soup is even better.

> _After eating, I wanted to go to Chatuchak Market, which is a bit far, so I didn't want to walk and transfer to BTS, so I took an Uber directly \(THB 374\)._

Chatuchak is quite large, with dense vendors, but overall it's clean and easy to navigate. However, many items are repetitive and seem to be selling touristy Made In China products.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GJv4mk3v2-DptRofTF_9zg.jpeg)

In the end, I only bought a Thai brand, Phutawan indoor diffuser, as a souvenir.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*28EbS8N3OUJwSCPrgaTb8Q.png)

After shopping, I walked into a massage shop inside for a foot massage and some shoulder and neck massage. \(1 hour/THB 250\)
#### Restroom

If you need to use the restroom at Chatuchak, there are paid restrooms \(THB 5 per use\) outside the market. I went in, and it was very clean, with one stall per person, and they are basically cleaned all the time. If you don't want to pay, you can go to the nearby [Mixt Chatuchak](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5PwQcFThBHtFpbzw6){:target="_blank"} mall, which has free and equally clean restrooms.

After eating, I continued to browse and bought a cup of durian juice to drink, which was rich and authentic in flavor and reasonably priced \(THB 89\).

> _I later found out that things at Chatuchak are actually cheaper; for example, the menthol nasal sticks here sell 6 for $99, while Big C sells 6 for $140… and the durian juice is also cheaper; it sells for over $140 at night markets in the city._ 

#### 15:00 Take BTS to King Power Mahanakhon

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*A4V3CL5XvLoQ4sp487pJuQ.jpeg)

Chatuchak is closer to the MRT, but we need to go to King Power Mahanakhon, which is at BTS Chong Nonsi station; it takes about 1 KM \(15 mins\) to walk from Chatuchak to the nearest BTS Saphan Khwai station.
#### King Power Mahanakhon (Bangkok's King Power Mahanakhon)

Ticket price: THB 1,080 per person

> _Before taking the elevator, you can choose whether to take a photo \(the ticket includes a series of free digital photos; if you want physical photos, you have to pay extra\)._

The direct elevator has a 360-degree scene animation similar to Taipei 101 and the Tokyo Skytree; the height is about the same as Tokyo Tower.

The elevator first takes you to the indoor observation deck on the 74th floor, where there is a café and public seating for a short rest. To reach the outdoor observation deck on the 78th floor, you need to take another elevator or walk up the stairs.

As soon as you arrive on the 78th floor, there is a small bar where you can order a drink and enjoy the view.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*PeqjUWSwE1Hh24qWkioTxA.png)

After exiting the 78th floor, you can continue up to the stairs and the top floor lounge area.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dFRAU2mY_Qp9T0ru4GngIg.jpeg)

From the top floor, you can enjoy a panoramic view of Bangkok, and you can imagine how beautiful the night view must be!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*f4eREu0dL79OzsYCtl1O9A.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XOsqBu8PjCeB7XSlsD0_Fg.jpeg)

The stairs and the top floor lounge area face the famous transparent glass corridor, where you can see straight down to the ground. You can grab shoe covers from the nearby box to enter, but **using mobile phones is prohibited; you can ask your companions or staff for help with taking photos.**

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*K2MOcxsrNbuNbz00sPfNOg.png)

The entire glass corridor isn't very large, about the size of a rooftop infinity pool at a hotel. It doesn't feel very high when viewed from the side, but walking on it can still be a bit scary, making your legs feel a little weak XD

### Ratchada Night Market (formerly known as Train Night Market)

![You can swipe your credit card directly at the MRT](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*BrfghHaJknyt6IiX7yOgbA.jpeg)

You can swipe your credit card directly at the MRT.

To get to Central Rama 9, you need to transfer to the MRT subway at Pharam 9 Station. The Rabbit Card cannot be used here, so you need to buy a ticket or you can now use a VISA card to enter and exit directly.

> _I tested that the Taishin GoGo card works, but I haven't tried the Cathay Cube._

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*c6Ug9F-JfXPzgnfvtvRvdg.jpeg)

For dinner, we came here to find food. I must say that Bangkok's night markets and markets are far superior to those in Taiwan. The overall environment is clean, with seating areas, and it’s well-organized, making it very comfortable to stroll around.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1cBlgC7kvmt1fWeMfiDVMA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OVMfzMU1HugpE0CVyUiSVw.jpeg)

After browsing around, we first tried the dessert on the left (similar to egg cake?) and the savory seafood grill on the right. Both were chewy and quite good.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*31mIDWp4WgTX8TSK5Q-C4Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*jMuzNnI8CCSLDZj4Tq9jHQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*K3ZN-Kiwz4yTiNHiZ3P1bg.jpeg)

Next, we had the highlight dish: volcanic ribs. The flavor was quite unique, with a lemongrass and spicy sauce. You can grab them with your hands while wearing gloves, and they are very appetizing!

After eating, we bought coconut ice cream with mango and peanut dessert from another stall, which was also delicious!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GamIzqKB9ROnECRfhPfA1Q.jpeg)

Afterward, we returned to Central Rama 9 to browse a bit. There is also the famous NaRaYa Bangkok bag here.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*a5BcYS64yitoccK9TTU1HQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*csaO0X3lGf2TSIb3xQ8JWg.jpeg)

On the way back to the hotel, we happened to encounter Bangkok after the rain, with colorful digital advertising screens creating a vibrant contrast, giving off a cyberpunk vibe.

#### 7–11 Hot Pressed Toast Late Night Snack

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*xQi9q1iA7o6FyfAeEISTEw.jpeg)

On the way back to the hotel, I tried Thailand's [hot pressed toast from convenience stores](https://supertaste.tvbs.com.tw/pack/347495){:target="_blank"} along with Thai banana milk. The filling was melted cheese with a hot dog, and the crust was flaky! It was really delicious and cheap!

### 8/05 Day 4 Central World, Big C, Terminal 21

> **_Didn’t sleep well all night + hungover all day, feeling a bit dazed._**

#### Central World

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8pZ3crfkb4wIqZZOoI9-zA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6_evilQk4T0LdCYSIgBudg.jpeg)

In the morning, I headed out to Central World for some shopping.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Sp3TTqnEx3yn6IM4H38NsQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*tmLvijY5Q7TVJbMo4D4XFg.jpeg)

On the first floor, there is a SHAKE SHACK burger place. I ordered the SHAKE SHACK signature burger and the coconut milkshake flavor that is unique to Bangkok. The burger was tasty and not greasy, but I found the milkshake a bit too sweet.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OXOp4dN-5p9xS1ojcu0b9A.jpeg)

The place is quite large, and just like ICONSIAM, if you want to explore thoroughly, you won't finish in one visit... I just casually bought a shirt.

#### Big C

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*JNswfx_h01UuffS299HjgQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GWD-HcYbLfAQEAN99tErsw.jpeg)

After finishing at Central World, I walked across to Big C to buy snacks and souvenirs. (There are many options, but I didn't find them to be cheaper...)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Bda3BGHI_ZeylIS96UNcWg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*DWtvvjZ3iAwk5U3MPZDudg.jpeg)

![Bottom left: Phutawan indoor diffuser was bought yesterday at Chatuchak, but I guess it can also be found in department stores in the city.](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*aMillKlyevVx8fDncaurSA.png)

The bottom left Phutawan indoor diffuser was purchased yesterday at Chatuchak, but I suspect it can also be found in city department stores.

Additionally, Big C seems to no longer provide plastic bags, so you need to buy an eco-friendly bag in the store.

> _That durian chips bag looks big, but it actually only contains two small bags... However, they are quite tasty._

#### Lunch

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*z4VW1WOelH7UjBco9PIAqg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*JsLSSg1m40v8aWJCmGkwzQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*qWWrZXa_LRClqCTi7bZK3Q.png)

There was a food market event in the outdoor plaza of Central World. It’s not just a simple setup with tents; it has a theme, and this time it was Titanic. You can enter for free by following their official YouTube channel; the decorations inside were also quite exquisite.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*9iurlEySgDL-ZQZzVGDiug.jpeg)

But for lunch, we ended up eating at SHAKE SHACK again, this time opting for the chicken thigh burger, which was just as delicious.

#### Afternoon: Returned to the hotel for a nap, as I was too tired from not sleeping well and being hungover.

#### Dinner at Terminal 21 Shopping Mall

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8_lDD7yaIYIq7HV4zG4ClA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1T7njk_JYMi1eP1oMbjH-w.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*giNbQ1GPda-qPFaA8yQ7sQ.jpeg)

Terminal 21 is also a place you can never finish exploring. Each floor has a different regional theme; for example, the Japan floor mainly sells Japanese products and restaurants.

I mainly met up with [Chun-Hsiu Liu](https://medium.com/u/72361fccaa43){:target="_blank"} at the food street upstairs for a meal. ( **A cheap and delicious place highly recommended for food!** )

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ZyuBXqyjZtLw5zyVmarw6w.png)

At the food street, you find your own seat, and many locals come here to eat.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*a4MnqcM5Bi9jRPC3T29s5A.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*sYc87mPtI1nf3-9pk_F13w.png)

> _⚠️ **The payment method here is that the vendors do not collect money directly. You need to go to the counter to exchange cash for a food card, and then use the food card's QR code to pay. After eating, return to the counter to return the card for a refund. (No deposit or handling fee required)**_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*rt81B-Pc31OZeMlgG5M38Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*k1vmadbwhdJsJNmkllarLQ.jpeg)

There are many options to choose from; just line up, tell them your number, and use the food card's QR code to pay. You can also take out (I remember there's an additional THB 10 packaging fee).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Ol8uiQNEnE9tuZc-qbgqgQ.jpeg)

I ordered seafood fried instant noodles (THB 50) + pork chop with fries (THB 59) = THB 109.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t2R762mSI8CeoDWpSAuEKg.jpeg)

After eating, I also took a box of mango sticky rice back to the hotel for a late-night snack.

It was really delicious and cheap!!! A meal at a restaurant outside usually starts at THB 200–300, while here, most meals are around THB 50–80.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*G4G79vwVWj592tOApWbK2g.jpeg)

After eating, I went to the back to stroll around [Benjakitti Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bmKhQpbw9KTtLYeN8){:target="_blank"} and look for the legendary [Bangkok Monitor Lizard](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%B7%A8%E8%9C%A5%E4%BD%94%E9%A0%98%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8-%E8%A2%AB%E5%B0%81%E6%B3%B0%E7%89%88%E4%BE%8F%E7%BE%8E%E5%9C%92-104942584.html){:target="_blank"}; perhaps because it was nighttime, I didn’t see a single one.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dMZhzj3rAqhRWAVuxeS0XQ.jpeg)

Back at the hotel, my travel companions had bought mangosteen to taste. I found the fresh ones delicious, with a subtle sweetness combined with the flavor of the mangosteen, making it very palatable. Later, I tried dried mangosteen, but it didn't taste as good; it was dry and sour.

> **_As for durians, the prices in Bangkok are not cheaper... a whole one costs THB 200 – 300._**

### 8/06 Day 5 Return Trip
#### Bangkok Monitor Lizard

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*E0M71hXTtQmzl2YP6kgPtw.jpeg)

In the morning, I was determined and went to [Lumphini Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n53FhsjXUUJLnghn6){:target="_blank"} to find the legendary Bangkok Monitor Lizard. Due to time constraints, I only found one medium-sized lizard that had just come out to bask in the sun.

> _Looking for the monitor lizard was just a personal whim of mine. It is said that locals dislike these lizards (water monitor lizards) because they eat dirty things, so it's best not to touch them._

#### 12:00 Back to the hotel to pick up luggage and head to the airport

My flight is at 15:20, so I need to leave by noon. It takes about an hour to get from the city to the airport.

> _👉👉👉 You can refer to KKday's airport transfer service:_

The Grab fare from the hotel was THB 577, which required taking the highway; the driver paid the toll first, and the Grab card payment would later include the toll fee. (I remember it was about THB 50.)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ENH0G1_tBNWy-8RHV9XCag.jpeg)

The checked baggage limit is only 15 kg, and I managed to stick to it.

After clearing immigration around 13:20, the security checks at Bangkok airport are quite strict. Everything must go through security, and carry-on bags almost always need to be opened for manual inspection.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*QLYTVQ2GpR2u9JpE6XeekA.jpeg)

After going through immigration and security, I had about an hour to grab a bite to eat; I found a Thai restaurant for my last meal in Thailand. \(Seafood fried rice, mango juice, mango sticky rice\).

> _Many shops sell mango sticky rice in takeout boxes after you exit, so if you don't have enough, you can buy some to eat on the plane!_

> _**\(⚠️ But remember, it's prohibited to bring it back to Taiwan ⚠️\)**_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ouwulscC2q0OsIujIa2iXg.jpeg)

I had to give this bottle of water a close-up because the budget airline doesn't provide anything, and I thought I'd buy water at the airport. However, after exiting, bottled water costs THB 70 — 100, and this one was THB 100.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*rXfw5dbuYOFCumEd7ku_Dw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*rOoff9qAZL6L4LjXH4DNfw.jpeg)

BKK is huge... filled with Trip\.com advertisements. My return flight was on time, so I took the shuttle bus to the terminal.
#### Back to Taiwan

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*asUAWDh4hGhI4rn2_XfO0g.jpeg)

Arriving at TPE Taoyuan International Airport, I collected my luggage and headed straight to catch the `1841` or `1819` Kuo-Kuang Motor Transport bus back to Taipei, which was very convenient without needing to transfer.
### ⚠️ Safety and Precautions for Traveling in Bangkok, Thailand ⚠️

The most important thing when going out is safety, so I've compiled a list of safety tips and precautions.
#### Scam Prevention

[![The Eight Most Common Scams in Thailand Travel, Some Still Catching People!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o42r-bg16Fg){:target="_blank"}](/assets/b7e7c0938985/07b5_hqdefault.jpg)

The following is a summary based on a video by the Bangkok Cat. I encountered a currency exchange scam during this trip.
1. Incorrect calculations
   It may not always be intentional; you can calculate the total amount when ordering.
2. Someone approaches you wanting to see your country's currency or asking to exchange money
   When you pull out your wallet, they might steal or pickpocket you.
3. Outside the Grand Palace or attractions, someone falsely claims the site is closed and enthusiastically suggests taking a tuk-tuk to other places (black temples/black shops/ **private boat tours, which I encountered at the pier this time**).
4. Tuk-tuks often have inflated prices or suddenly increase the fare halfway through.
   If you want to experience a tuk-tuk but are worried about being overcharged, [you can try the new MUVMI app for tuk-tuk rides](https://bkk.com.tw/muvmi-app/){:target="_blank"}.
   Even if a tuk-tuk looks good, be cautious of scam #3, where they enthusiastically direct you to attractions or boat rides.
5. Fake staff members may approach you while you're waiting in line, enthusiastically inviting you inside.
   They will use your language to explain the menu, help you order, and then ask for payment before running off with your money.
6. Motorcycle and scooter rental scams
   Do not leave your passport as a deposit, do not leave your passport as a deposit, do not leave your passport as a deposit.
   If you encounter malicious scams claiming damage and demanding compensation, leaving your passport can lead to trouble.
   It's better to rent from larger chain rental companies, and always take video of the vehicle's condition before renting.
7. Local dating app scams
   You might end up meeting a ladyboy, a scammer, or someone with bad intentions.
8. The Patpong ping pong show scam, where enthusiastic touts ask if you want to see a ping pong show, claiming you only need to buy a 100 THB drink, then take you into a dark alley or a shady second-floor establishment.
   It's hard to leave, and when you try, they demand 3,000 THB, claiming there was no 100 THB deal.
9. Be cautious of pickpockets in crowded places, even in areas where you need to buy tickets to enter (e.g., the Grand Palace, Wat Pho).

#### 🌿🚬

Next year, it will be banned, but I can share some experiences.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️ Edibles (like gummies) have a strong effect, and the scary part is that they feel just like regular gummies when you eat them; the effects can suddenly hit you a few hours later ⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- It's best to try them gradually: eat 1/3, wait a few hours... if nothing happens, eat 2/3... wait a few hours... if you feel something, then try eating one whole piece...
- Smoking should also be done gradually, depending on your body type.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️ Regardless, I strongly recommend trying it only in your hotel; if you feel out of it, you can rest directly, which is safer ⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- Just because you drink doesn't mean you have a higher tolerance.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️** Your heart rate may increase and feel uncomfortable **⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- It's important to have someone sober around to take care of you, which is safer.
- Smoking is only acceptable in specific situations.

#### Other
- Thailand is not a tipping culture; generally, you don't need to tip. I only leave a THB 20 tip for massages as a token gesture.
- Alcohol can only be sold from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM and from 5:00 PM to midnight; it's prohibited all day on Buddhist holidays.
- Not all hotel balconies allow smoking, so it's best to ask.
- The emergency hotline for foreigners is `1155`.
- SuperRich has specific business hours, so if you arrive too early or too late, you won't be able to exchange money.

I didn't take many photos of the hotel; I only captured one morning shot where I woke up to find a giant centipede in my blanket.
### Day 2
#### [Santorini Park, Greek-style Town](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5e56XAK4en27bHbPA){:target="_blank"} \(Closed\)

[**【Hua Hin Qixian Attractions】Santorini Amusement Park: A Great Place for Photos in Thailand**](https://www.bring-you.info/zh-tw/santorini-park){:target="_blank"}
[_On the way from Bangkok to Hua Hin, you pass through the Qixian area, where there is a Greek-themed "Santorini Amusement Park," a popular spot for Thai families to stroll on weekends. If you love taking photos, I highly recommend visiting this incredibly romantic park._ www\.bring\-you\.info](https://www.bring-you.info/zh-tw/santorini-park){:target="_blank"}

It seems to be a small amusement park with Greek-style scenery.
#### [Hua Hin Artist Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UcF7Wd82aHq4aGP86){:target="_blank"}

A well-known attraction that is still open in 2024.

There are many paintings and artworks.
#### Back to Sheraton Hotel to Enjoy Facilities and the Beach

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*448HsB-gg4LjZx0qBo-Fkw.jpeg)

The hotel is in a villa style, with each unit being a standalone building. The swimming pool surrounds all the rooms, and there's a bar by the pool; the beach outside is an undeveloped area, quite barren.

After dinner, we went to a nearby night market.
### Day 3
#### [Maeklong Railway Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Jsbm5FFwYf2ArEW36){:target="_blank"}

It was too early, and everyone gave up on going.
#### [Damnoen Saduak Floating Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tKSTmHgaHc4YCbpZ6){:target="_blank"}

I remember it being quite thrilling and adventurous, even though the water was murky and had an odor.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*qy7YBGcWTMfpItXtapHr9g.jpeg)

The guide specifically told the staff not to step on my back; I remember it being very luxurious, but it hurt so much during the massage that I couldn't sleep XD.
#### [River City Shopping Complex](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L3Pnv1BpLCpcGs7G7){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7tYE57IoZUXg1gQhWuSa8g.jpeg)

Since we were going to the Chao Phraya Princess cruise + buffet dinner that night, we first visited the nearby shopping mall.
#### Chao Phraya Princess Cruise Buffet Dinner

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*EEELplqEfG3bLcGUoLAvRQ.jpeg)

I remember the food being decent, but the main highlight was the beautiful night view, where you could see the lights of the Bangkok [Riverside Night Market Ferris Wheel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/evFHo6ciFY4jswSt9){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6pzhTRcjRh_b6Z4jOJH_fg.jpeg)

After returning to the hotel, we went to the bar on the Marriott rooftop for a drink; I only remember the beautiful night view and the cheap drinks.
### Day 4 Free Day

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*NU2LiyNLR8lgf7phtPYKHg.jpeg)

I only remember going shopping at the mall, Big C, and Central World.
#### In the evening, we went to [Zoom Sky Bar at Anantara Sathorn Bangkok Hotel](https://www.kkday.com/zh-hk/product/105589-zoom-sky-bar-anantara-sathorn-bangkok-package?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} for drinks.

### Day 5 Return Trip

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*SpSAMDAk7Pp7SSCrmCyBQQ.jpeg)

This concludes my memories from the 2018 employee trip. This time, returning to Bangkok on a fully free trip allowed me to become more familiar with the city. Compared to my previous impressions, I feel it has become more prosperous, the food is better, and prices have increased.
