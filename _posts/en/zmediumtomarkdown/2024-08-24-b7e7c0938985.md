### \[Travelogue\] 2024 Bangkok, Thailand 🇹🇭 5-Day Free Trip

A five-day quick trip to Bangkok, Thailand after the pandemic.



![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*kRZZjY_7_6WaKRkw9E74iw.jpeg)

#### Memories of Bangkok

Let's go back to 2018, my first job's employee trip with the first company, and my first time going abroad, which was to Bangkok, Thailand (5 days); the following year in 2019, I went to Sabah with the company trip again; then came the two years stolen by the pandemic, and after it ended, I started going crazy with trips to Japan.

At that time, I was a complete novice, with zero social experience, blindly following my older siblings out, not even knowing what I could or couldn't bring on the plane. During security checks, I foolishly placed my passport on top of the basket, and when it came out of the machine, I found it had fallen onto the conveyor belt, almost giving me a heart attack (if it had fallen into the gap, I wouldn't have been able to come back); that trip was mindlessly joining a tour group and mindlessly taking a bus, so my impression of Bangkok wasn't very clear. I only remember that the rooftop bar was great, the weather was hot, things were cheap, and massages were inexpensive, and that's about it. I had no concept of the geographical location at all.

Therefore, I always thought about returning to Bangkok to revisit the old places and supplement the memories from six years ago; however, I wasn't familiar with Southeast Asia and was hesitant to travel alone. **Just right at the beginning of the year, while chatting with colleagues from Pinkoi, we decided on this five-day free trip to Bangkok.**


> _The details and fragments of memories from the five-day trip to Bangkok + Hua Hin in 2018 are attached at the end of the article._

Because I started a new job in June, I haven't had much time for leisure. Mark and Sean are mainly responsible for the arrangements and planning, and I haven't done much research.

#### Internet

This time the preparation was rushed, and I hadn't even arranged the internet the day before, so I didn't have time to buy my usual physical SIM card. Fortunately, I tried eSIM for the first time. (I fell in love with it after using it)

I directly purchased [**Thailand SIM Card | AIS 5G High-Speed Internet 8 Days Unlimited Data + Calls eSIM**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} on KKday, and after purchasing, I received the eSIM activation certificate directly, and it was ready to use.

#### Flight 🛫
- Outbound: TPE 16:00 -> BKK 18:45
- Return: BKK 15:20 -> TPE 20:10

```markdown
Airline: Thai VietJet Air

Price: `TWD $9,259` (including the additional round-trip **15 kg** checked baggage)

Initially, I thought about traveling together with everyone; my friend didn't check in luggage (the ticket price was around `$6,000`). Later, I checked other airlines and felt like I missed out; for similar time slots, regular airlines are about `$10,000`, which isn't a huge difference, but it's much more comfortable!

The baggage policy of Thai VietJet Air actually allows for no checked baggage; you can carry two pieces of hand luggage, with a total weight not exceeding 7 kilograms.
```
1. Hand luggage weight:
Each passenger (excluding infants) can bring 1 piece of their own luggage and 1 small hand luggage, with a maximum total weight not exceeding 7 kg.

2. Hand luggage dimensions:
- 01 piece of hand luggage with maximum dimensions of 56cm x 36cm x 23cm
- 01 piece of small hand luggage (including the following bags)
  + 01 bag for girls, magazines, cameras, bags for baby food, and bags purchased at the airport not exceeding 30cm x 20cm x 10cm.
  + 01 bag for a coat that, when opened, does not exceed dimensions of 114cm x 60cm x 11cm.
  + 01 bag for a laptop with maximum dimensions of 40cm x 30cm x 10cm
```

基本上背一個包包＋拖一個登機箱就可以了。

### 8/02 Day 1 Departure
#### Departing from home around 12:30 PM after work


![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*YsFObRlulrMFKHySvo3NAw.jpeg)



> _Remember to take the express train directly to the airport; the regular train, even if it’s the morning train, won’t arrive earlier than the express!_ 




#### Arriving at Taoyuan Airport Terminal 1 around 1:30 PM


![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*BBE4RhKU9tcJI427_LoQMw.jpeg)



![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ksagRFmStL9nLBWIyYY3Jg.png)


There was no one at the check-in counter, so I checked in and completed the baggage drop-off directly upon arrival.


![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GI5u8vhrNRbFdG-XqY_2LQ.png)



![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*CBOJ0KHI4dMmAP5REh1UaA.jpeg)


Again, it was B1R, the furthest corner with a shuttle bus to the boarding gate.


![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XMQJOe1n5vyVdWQrYJpgNg.png)


It was still early before 4 PM, so I went to eat at the famous Ding Guo Guo again. This time I discovered that I could order the Guo Guo bun separately; previously, they only sold fried chicken!


![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*hfpWAbwiM2Aal3MZJ36oOA.png)



![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XNjYtycibxeowQBaDT_jNw.jpeg)


This time I found out that if you walk further from Ding Guo Guo, it leads directly to Terminal 2, so if you have plenty of time, you can actually walk to Terminal 2 to eat; or you can come from Terminal 2 to the first terminal for the free VIP lounge to rest XD.


![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t4dk8GQIv0D53N0V_qo7KA.png)


After buying Ding Guo Guo, I went to the free VIP lounge in Terminal 1 to sit and rest, eat something. This time I saw someone charging their device; [last time when I came, all the sockets were taken, looks like they have been fixed](../cb65fd5ab770/) (?).
#### Heading to B1R waiting area around 3:30 PM


![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*2Ros8CQBKj0-kkMugSZ7Hg.png)



![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*At7elbjIueB9lvvenvlfTA.png)



![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*fpzrwzWez_HwgKFuFmDAhA.png)


I’m not sure if it’s because it’s a budget airline, but the information wasn’t updated (it kept showing 16:00, but it had actually changed to 16:35).


![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*puKndBRQgCKs3LKbXbzEWw.jpeg)



![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*zCT2uidCELNc7WL1NpW72Q.jpeg)



![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1aGwmjed9srQtHli3uDoxg.jpeg)


With the flight delayed, the actual departure time was 17:13.
- VietJet's seats are about the same size as Tigerair's, larger than Peach Aviation's, but the seats are uncomfortable; the leather sofa material is not breathable, and sitting for too long can be painful.
- VietJet should allow you to bring your own food; on the return trip, someone brought mango sticky rice to eat on board without any issues.

#### Arriving at Bangkok BKK Suvarnabhumi Airport at 19:30

I learned from a colleague that if you arrive at Bangkok Airport during peak hours, you can purchase [**Thailand Airport BKK Departure Meet and Greet Fast Track Service**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/160605?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} for quick access XD, but since we arrived at this time, there were almost only people from the same flight, so the customs clearance was very quick.
#### 20:00 Collecting luggage and exiting the airport


![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*QDvOtf4PsS-jSESOkb-0AA.jpeg)

```markdown
Perhaps due to the low-cost airline, not many people checked in luggage, and the baggage claim was super fast.
#### eSIM Network Setup

As soon as I exited the airport, I started figuring out how to set up and activate the eSIM, only to realize…

> **_⚠️Activating eSIM requires an internet connection⚠️_** 

> **_⚠️Activating eSIM requires an internet connection⚠️_** 

> **_⚠️Activating eSIM requires an internet connection⚠️_** 

It's a bit like buying a pair of scissors but needing another pair to cut open the package; activating the eSIM requires an internet connection to enable it. Fortunately, a friend traveling with me had already activated his eSIM in Taiwan, so I borrowed his internet to activate mine. \(The airport also has Wi-Fi available, so there's no need to worry too much\)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*_xv7JB_yl7d47ljrUTpYdw.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6vg_zfmf6tr3SIBUj6gi4A.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7-7yMcMgwbpNzBq1YgknaQ.png)

To find the eSIM activation, simply long-press the QR code and select "Add eSIM."

> **_I don't know why, but if you save the QR code to photos or notes, you lose this quick add feature. Another method is to send the QR code to your travel companions or print it out for your phone to scan._** 

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*hZBZoEJCLuHxEgbOVMEXBw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*_MctPE8uZYOdX5vnYoJnvg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*KMKLtNg2Aaeug_cn5fitNQ.jpeg)

iPhone iOS eSIM manual setup path: Settings -> Cellular -> Add eSIM -> Scan QR Code -> Manually enter information -> Input the information from the email -> Use as... You can select "Travel" -> For mobile data, choose to use "Travel" -> Done!

Once activated, it’s like having dual SIMs, but the original SIM card has no internet unless a roaming plan is purchased. **In case of emergency, you can switch back to the original SIM card number!**
- [For AIS mobile number inquiries, please dial *545#, for balance inquiries dial *121#, for data inquiries dial *121*3#](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}

#### 20:30 Airport Dining

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*mDPRItCdp28u5P6tTQelqQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*bgHNI9p20Jyf3t3IMDExMQ.jpeg)

Since it would take over an hour to get to the city and the hotel, and the low-cost airline does not provide meals, everyone was quite hungry, so we decided to grab dinner at the airport.

We found a Thai restaurant to eat at; the spicy basil pork was deliciously hot, and the vegetable soup helped alleviate the spiciness.
#### 21:00 Moving to the Hotel

> _👉👉👉 You can refer to KKday airport transfer services:_ 

> _[\- Thailand | Airport Private Transfer | Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) / Don Mueang Airport (DMK) — Bangkok/Pattaya/Hua Hin City Hotels](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/3431-bkk-or-dmk-bangkok-private-transfer?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*cagHOMc-TKS9fmhN18zVOQ.png)

After finishing dinner around 21:00, we started moving towards the city and the hotel.

**Taking public transport requires three transfers on the subway and BTS:**
1. Airport Rail Link `Suvarnabhumi` -> `Phaya Thai`
2. BTS Sukhumvit Line `Phaya Thai` -> `Siam`
3. BTS Silom Line `Siam` -> `Chong Nonsi`

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OvL8K9OxwjMCVJ-3hYy2bw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*-eJ_rrYns2teWCITXTnhTA.png)
```

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*PeWlfQ6fd55mU1Ojk0isJQ.png)

- The airport express line only allows ticket purchases.
- You can buy a Rabbit Card (BTS transportation card) at the ticket counter for recharging and tap in and out at BTS stations.
- Please note that **the Rabbit Card can only be used on BTS**, not on MRT or the airport express line.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*jY4Jg6_vGhAM5CjPrVM-Iw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Dom8OdbMSRAAXtFpykCTZQ.png)

- Arrived at `Chong Nonsi` (later found out that the King Power MahaNakhon building is at this station!)

#### Walk to [JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL](https://jckevin.com/){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6VrvZBTlo2gjg_lY7oQG8w.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*cgv3HGHsAkH8WL_jA6qTsg.jpeg)

When exiting BTS, don’t rush down the overpass; you can walk across the road from the overpass.

> **_I felt it was quite dark along the way (not many streetlights), and it was a bit far to walk (15 mins / 1 KM). It can be quite scary to walk alone at night_**, _and along the way, you will pass a 7–11 and a small night market, where I bought some snacks to take back to the hotel._

> _Additionally, if taking a taxi, due to the two-way road and U-turn issues, the driver has to go past the hotel a bit to the next gap to turn back, which is a bit troublesome._

#### 10:30 JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL

Arrived at the hotel around 10:30.

[![JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL](/assets/b7e7c0938985/43d8_hqdefault.jpg "JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg24V_VS6oA){:target="_blank"}

The room is very spacious, like a whole apartment, with a master bedroom, a second bedroom, two bathrooms, a kitchen, a living room, and a balcony.

#### 2018 Memories

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*E0aQK0xnj1XNpLGoOZFmsQ.jpeg)

Taken in 2018 / iPhone 6

What a coincidence! During the group trip to Bangkok in 2018, everyone took a taxi to the rooftop bar at this hotel XD.

Additionally, they also offer a Sky Bar dinner package:

#### 2024

2024 / iPhone 15 Pro

Since I’m staying here, after dropping off my luggage in the room, I went up to take a look.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*h8ksUQqToXHPTda_RnwkSg.jpeg)

Since it was already past dinner time, I could only order some snacks and skewers.

### 8/03 Day 2 Wat Pho, Grand Palace, Wat Phra Kaew, Wat Arun, ICONSIAM, Lhao Lhao, Rock Pub Live

#### Hotel Breakfast

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7m7nqO5Q1kdTTPQsdx9TWg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t1xva8yggECe94znx32pew.jpeg)

After having breakfast at the hotel in the morning, I went out. I thought the breakfast was okay, but there weren’t many options.

#### 9:30 Departure

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*A2zezLiqIEOngnuebgxUjA.jpeg)

Since there were many people, we directly took Grab (THB 135) to Wat Pho.

On the way, we passed by [Chinatown](https://www.kkday.com/zh-hk/blog/101689/bangkokchinatown?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}, but I forgot to take a photo; it had a very cyberpunk vibe!

> _**⚠️ Be cautious of pickpockets in crowded places ⚠️**_

You need to take off your shoes to enter, and you can walk around the Reclining Buddha to pay your respects.

#### SuperRich Currency Exchange

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GKVidaEFygfEMNjfKFNweA.jpeg)

After leaving Wat Pho, I thought I should first solve the currency exchange issue. Only one friend had exchanged some Thai Baht in advance; the others wanted to exchange in Bangkok. So we walked to the nearby [The Old Siam Shopping Plaza⁩](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UPNxgoTmtswuhHVS8){:target="_blank"} to exchange money at SuperRich.

**⚠️ Please note: The New Taiwan Dollars you want to exchange must not have stains, markings, etc.; otherwise, they will be rejected for exchange. (I happened to have a thousand-dollar bill withdrawn from an ATM in Taiwan that had a pencil mark and was rejected for exchange.)**

> _NTD $5,000 exchanged for THB $5,200_

Khanom bueang Thai Pancake

After exchanging money, we had cash, so we replenished our energy at the food market on the first floor; we had sweet Thai pancakes (ขนมเบื้อง) filled with meringue that tasted very sweet, like cotton candy, and also banana pancakes; finally, I bought an iced coffee to continue our journey.

#### Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew

Admission: THB 500/person.

Around 1 PM, after leaving the Grand Palace, we had lunch at a nearby Western restaurant heading towards the pier.

#### 14:00 Preparing to take the boat to Wat Arun

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ePMFJ1jf5orPQRQTEJHMnQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*HtIAOV8myKTKvIckI39XxQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*J5lIB0rYWPqPWrgkkNlB2g.jpeg)

> **_⚠️ There will be people outside the pier asking where you're going; be careful as they may be private boat operators charging high fees (THB 500, 1000) and are not safe; ignore them and find the official pier, tell the counter where you want to go. ⚠️_**

> **_The official fare is only THB 30 (_** _`Tha Chang` **to Wat Arun), the new boats have air conditioning, are safe and comfortable.**_**

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*oc8bbW-4ZZwQeFkqNhXwNw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ccUJ7WKGfb73k8UWEDNesg.jpeg)

When the boat arrives, the staff will announce "Wat Arun" (yes, in Chinese), and you can ask anytime if you're unsure.

At this time, it looks like an afternoon thunderstorm is approaching, and you can see the water flowing muddy and turbulent.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8hMHmiUOANTISYOVpTISiA.jpeg)

The boat is new, the air conditioning is cool, it's enclosed and very safe, and there are quite a few departures, making it very convenient!

When you arrive, the staff will also announce "Wat Arun."
#### 14:30 Arrive at Wat Arun
```


Tickets: THB 200

After disembarking, you will arrive at Wat Arun, where you can queue directly to buy tickets for entry.


> **_⚠️ Wat Arun also has a dress code️⚠️_** 
 

> **_No bare shoulders, shorts, midriffs, or short skirts._** 
 

> **_You can wear traditional Thai clothing; many people wear it for photos._**

You can walk to the middle platform for photos (⚠️ the stairs are steep, so be careful); many people also change into traditional Thai clothing to take commemorative photos here.

After the visit, return to the pier and find the ticket booth (PIER 2) to buy a ticket for the boat to ICONSIAM (THB 40), then head to PIER 1 to board.

ICONSIAM is very large and looks luxurious, with a unique food court on the first floor.

Stroll towards the BTS Charoen Nakhon platform, thinking of getting a foot massage for an hour.

There’s a newer, larger place outside the station (1) THAI GARDEN MASSAGE, but they were fully booked; fortunately, I continued walking to (2) another massage shop as shown in the picture; I found it very comfortable, less crowded, spacious, and quieter, with affordable rates (foot/1 hour/THB 270).

After the massage, I had the energy to continue shopping, returning to ICONSIAM; I walked all the way to the upstairs restaurant, which is also very extravagant, featuring a jungle, small bridges, flowing water, and a waterfall, overall quite nice!


> _I bought the famous Japanese fries TORO FRIES (the line was very long) to recharge._

> _There is also Japanese % coffee here._

This line is a branch line with only three stations and less frequent service.

> _Google Maps seems to have no information on this BTS line; it suggested I walk to Krung Thon Buri._ 

From here, taking one stop to Krung Thon Buri connects to the Silom Line.

The owner seems to be Chinese (from China)? It feels like a Thai restaurant that blends Chinese cuisine, a highly-rated old establishment, and apparently a favorite of Blackpink's LISA.

Since we were heading to a pub to listen to live music later, we ate a bit hurriedly, but I found every dish delicious!!
- In the first three images, the background of the goose brand cooling balm, the one that looks like minced meat, is called หมูสับผัดหนำเลี้ยบ, which seems to be stir-fried minced meat with pickled olives? It's very good with rice!
- In the second image, the fried oyster omelet, similar to the fried oyster omelet from Shilin Night Market in Taiwan.
- In the second image, the seasonal limited drink, longan tea.
- In the second image, the most special dish, crab curry (Panang Curry), is made with a whole fresh large crab.

> _The goose brand cooling balm recommended by Thais; I later bought a jar that smells smoother than a menthol nasal stick and has less nasal irritation!_

Cat lover, there are many cats in Bangkok, and they immediately come to rub against me.

In the morning, I took a Grab to [Wang Chun Sheng Beef Hot Pot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1VuwzAdKS4vH6kmj6){:target="_blank"} for breakfast. The overall flavor is quite Chinese/Taiwanese, I think it's good, but Tainan beef soup is even better.


> _After eating, we headed to Chatuchak Market. Since it's a bit far, I didn't want to walk and took an Uber instead (THB 374)._

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*0ofswmspB9w2vM7mII57_g.jpeg)

Chatuchak Market is large and densely packed with vendors, but overall it is clean and easy to navigate. However, many items are repetitive in nature, and it seems that a lot of them are tourist-oriented Made In China products.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GJv4mk3v2-DptRofTF_9zg.jpeg)

In the end, I only bought a Thai brand, Phutawan indoor diffuser, as a souvenir.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*28EbS8N3OUJwSCPrgaTb8Q.png)

After getting tired from walking, I went into a massage shop for a foot massage and some shoulder and neck massage. \(1 hour/THB 250\)

#### Restrooms

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*tGe2u5gIF70mPz3d7sX5XQ.jpeg)

If you need to use the restroom at Chatuchak, there are paid restrooms outside the market \(THB 5 per use\). I went in and found it very clean, with one stall per person, and it is basically cleaned at all times. If you don't want to pay for a restroom, you can go to the nearby [Mixt Chatuchak](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5PwQcFThBHtFpbzw6){:target="_blank"} mall, which has free and equally clean restrooms.

Seafood Rice

For lunch, I casually resolved it at a restaurant inside the [Mixt Chatuchak](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5PwQcFThBHtFpbzw6){:target="_blank"} mall, and the taste was quite good.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*LeJHthehTAM7xdrlOLhETg.jpeg)

After eating, I continued to stroll around and bought a cup of durian juice to drink. The flavor was rich and authentic, and the price was reasonable \(THB 89\).

> _Later, I found that items at Chatuchak are actually cheaper. For example, a pack of 6 mint nasal sticks sells for $99 here, while Big C sells them for $140... and the durian juice as well, which sells for over $140 at night markets in the city._

#### 15:00 Take BTS to King Power Mahanakhon

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*A4V3CL5XvLoQ4sp487pJuQ.jpeg)

Chatuchak is closer to the MRT, but the King Power Mahanakhon we are going to is at BTS Chong Nonsi station; it takes about 1 KM \(15 mins\) to walk from Chatuchak to the nearest BTS Saphan Khwai station.

#### King Power Mahanakhon (Bangkok's King Power Mahanakhon)

Ticket price: THB 1,080/person

> _👉👉👉 [**I recommend buying tickets in advance from KKday, as the price is cheaper: Bangkok King Power Mahanakhon SkyWalk observation deck tickets (free cancellation 2 days in advance)**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20739-king-power-mahanakhon-sky-walk-bangkok-ticket?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}_

It doesn't look as towering up close as I imagined, but the architectural style is very unique, more cyberpunk.

You need to go through a security check before entering, and after buying the ticket, you can use the free luggage storage. Backpacks cannot be taken up \(small waist bags are allowed\).

_Free synthesized digital photo, after visiting, staff will guide you to download when you come down from the elevator_

The direct elevator has a 360-degree scene animation similar to Taipei 101 and the Sky Tower; its height is approximately similar to that of the Tokyo Tower.

After taking the elevator up, you will first arrive at the indoor observation deck on the 74th floor, where there is a café and public seating for a short rest; to continue, you need to transfer to another elevator or take the stairs to the 78th floor, which is the outdoor observation deck.

On the 78th floor, there is a small bar right after you arrive, where you can order a drink and enjoy the view.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*PeqjUWSwE1Hh24qWkioTxA.png)

After coming out on the 78th floor, you can continue to walk up to the stairs and the rooftop rest area.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dFRAU2mY_Qp9T0ru4GngIg.jpeg)

From the rooftop, you can overlook the entire Bangkok, and one can imagine that the night view must be beautiful!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XOsqBu8PjCeB7XSlsD0_Fg.jpeg)

The stairs and the rooftop rest area face the famous transparent glass corridor, where you can see the ground directly below. You can take shoe covers from the nearby box to enter, but **it is prohibited to carry mobile phones; you can ask your companions or staff for assistance in taking photos.**

The entire glass corridor is not very large, about the size of a rooftop infinity pool at a hotel. It doesn't feel very high when viewed from the side, but walking on it still makes one a bit scared, feeling a bit weak in the knees XD

### Chatuchak Night Market (formerly Ratchada Train Night Market)

![MRT can directly swipe credit cards](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*BrfghHaJknyt6IiX7yOgbA.jpeg)

MRT can directly swipe credit cards

To get to Central Rama 9, you need to transfer to the MRT subway at Pharam 9 Station. The Rabbit Card cannot be used; you need to buy a ticket or now you can use a VISA card to swipe in and out.

> _Tested with Taishin GoGo card, but haven't tried with Cathay Cube._

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*c6Ug9F-JfXPzgnfvtvRvdg.jpeg)

For dinner, I came here to find food. I must say that Bangkok's night markets and markets surpass Taiwan by a lot. The overall environment is clean, there are seating areas, it’s not chaotic, and it’s well-planned, making it very comfortable to stroll around.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1cBlgC7kvmt1fWeMfiDVMA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OVMfzMU1HugpE0CVyUiSVw.jpeg)

After walking around, I first had the dessert on the left (similar to egg cake?), and the savory seafood grill on the right. Both were chewy and quite good.

```

```markdown
Next up is the main event, the volcano ribs, which have a rather unique flavor. The sauce has a lemongrass and spicy sour taste. You can just put on gloves and grab them to eat, very appetizing!

After finishing, I bought coconut ice cream + mango + peanut dessert from another stall, which was also delicious!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GamIzqKB9ROnECRfhPfA1Q.jpeg)

After eating, I strolled around Central Rama 9, where there is also the famous NaRaYa Bangkok bag.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*a5BcYS64yitoccK9TTU1HQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*csaO0X3lGf2TSIb3xQ8JWg.jpeg)

On the way back to the hotel, I happened to encounter a rain-soaked Bangkok paired with colorful digital advertising screens. The color contrast was intense, giving a very cyberpunk feel.

#### 7–11 Hot Pressed Toast Late Night Snack

On the way back to the hotel, I tried Thailand's [convenience store hot pressed toast](https://supertaste.tvbs.com.tw/pack/347495){:target="_blank"} and Thai banana milk. The filling was melted cheese hot dog, and the crust was flaky! The crust was flaky! The crust was flaky! It was very delicious and cheap!

### 8/05 Day 4 Central World, Big C, Terminal 21

> **_Did not sleep well all night + hungover all day, feeling dazed._**

#### Central World

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8pZ3crfkb4wIqZZOoI9-zA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6_evilQk4T0LdCYSIgBudg.jpeg)

I woke up in the morning and went out to shop at Central World.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Sp3TTqnEx3yn6IM4H38NsQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*tmLvijY5Q7TVJbMo4D4XFg.jpeg)

On the first floor, there is a SHAKE SHACK burger. It was my first time trying it, so I ordered the SHAKE SHACK signature burger and the coconut milkshake flavor that is unique to Bangkok. The burger was tasty and not greasy, but I found the milkshake too sweet.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OXOp4dN-5p9xS1ojcu0b9A.jpeg)

The inside is very large, and just like ICONSIAM, if you want to shop seriously, you won't finish in a day... I just casually bought a shirt.

#### Big C

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*JNswfx_h01UuffS299HjgQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GWD-HcYbLfAQEAN99tErsw.jpeg)

After shopping at Central World, I walked across to Big C to buy snacks and souvenirs. (There are many options, but I don't think they are cheaper...)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Bda3BGHI_ZeylIS96UNcWg.jpeg)

Bottom left: Phutawan indoor diffuser was bought yesterday at Chatuchak, but I guess it can also be found in department stores in the city.

Additionally, it seems that Big C no longer provides plastic bags, so you have to buy eco-friendly bags in the store.

> _That big pack of dried durian actually only has two small bags inside... but it's quite tasty._

#### Lunch

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*z4VW1WOelH7UjBco9PIAqg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*qWWrZXa_LRClqCTi7bZK3Q.png)

The outdoor plaza of Central World had a food market event. It wasn't just a simple setup with tents and stalls; it had a theme, and this time the theme was Titanic. You could enter for free by following their official YouTube channel; the interior was also very exquisitely decorated.
```

```markdown
![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*9iurlEySgDL-ZQZzVGDiug.jpeg)

But for lunch, we went to SHAKE SHACK again, this time trying the chicken thigh burger, which was just as delicious.
#### Afternoon: Back to the hotel for a nap, because I didn't sleep well + hangover... I was really tired.
#### Dinner at Terminal 21

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8_lDD7yaIYIq7HV4zG4ClA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*giNbQ1GPda-qPFaA8yQ7sQ.jpeg)

Terminal 21 is also a place you can explore endlessly, with each floor themed around different regions. For example, the Japan section mainly sells Japanese products and restaurants.

The main plan was to meet [Chun\-Hsiu Liu](https://medium.com/u/72361fccaa43){:target="_blank"} at the upstairs food court for a meal. \( **Affordable and delicious, highly recommended food spot** \)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ZyuBXqyjZtLw5zyVmarw6w.png)

At the food court, you find your own seat, and many locals come here to eat.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*a4MnqcM5Bi9jRPC3T29s5A.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*sYc87mPtI1nf3-9pk_F13w.png)

> _⚠️ **The payment method here is that the vendors do not collect money directly. You need to go to the counter to exchange cash for a food card, and pay using the QR code on the food card; after eating, return to the counter to return the card and get a refund. \(No deposit or service fee required\)**_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*rt81B-Pc31OZeMlgG5M38Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*k1vmadbwhdJsJNmkllarLQ.jpeg)

There are quite a few options available; just line up, tell them your number, and pay with the food card QR code. You can also take out \(I remember there’s an additional THB 10 packaging fee\).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Ol8uiQNEnE9tuZc-qbgqgQ.jpeg)

I ordered seafood fried instant noodles \(THB 50\) + pork chop fries \(THB 59\) = THB 109

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t2R762mSI8CeoDWpSAuEKg.jpeg)

After eating, I also took a box of mango sticky rice back to the hotel for a late-night snack.

It was really delicious and cheap!!! A meal at a restaurant outside usually costs at least 200–300, while here, most meals are around THB 50–80.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*G4G79vwVWj592tOApWbK2g.jpeg)

After eating, I went to the nearby [Benjakitti Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bmKhQpbw9KTtLYeN8){:target="_blank"} for a stroll, hoping to find the legendary [Bangkok Monitor Lizard](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%B7%A8%E8%9C%A5%E4%BD%94%E9%A0%98%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8-%E8%A2%AB%E5%B0%81%E6%B3%B0%E7%89%88%E4%BE%8F%E7%BE%8E%E5%85%AC%E5%9C%92-104942584.html){:target="_blank"}; perhaps because it was night, I didn't see a single one.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dMZhzj3rAqhRWAVuxeS0XQ.jpeg)

Returning to the hotel, my travel companions bought mangosteen to taste. I found the fresh ones delicious, with a light sweetness combined with the flavor of the mangosteen, very smooth. Later, I tried dried mangosteen, but it didn't taste great; it was just dry and sour.

> **_As for durians, the prices in Bangkok are not cheaper... each room costs THB 200 – 300._**

### 8/06 Day 5 Return Trip
#### Bangkok's Giant Lizard

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6oX4YygURRzsrDmv_OAJ2Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*E0M71hXTtQmzl2YP6kgPtw.jpeg)

In the morning, not giving up, I specially went to [Lumphini Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n53FhsjXUUJLnghn6){:target="_blank"} to find the legendary giant lizard of Bangkok. Due to time constraints, I only found one medium-sized lizard that had just come out to bask in the sun.

> _Searching for the giant lizard was just a personal whim of mine; it is said that locals really dislike these lizards (water monitor lizards) because they eat very dirty things, so don’t touch them casually._

#### 12:00 Return to Hotel to Pick Up Luggage and Head to Airport

The flight is at 15:20, so we need to leave by noon. It takes about an hour from the city to the airport.

Departing from the hotel, the Grab fare was THB 577, and we needed to get on the highway; the driver would pay the toll first, and the final Grab charge would include the toll fee. (I remember it was about THB 50)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ENH0G1_tBNWy-8RHV9XCag.jpeg)

Checked baggage can only be 15 kg, and I managed to stick to it.

After clearing immigration around 13:20, the security checks at Bangkok airport are quite strict; everything must go through security, and almost all carry-on luggage needs to be opened for manual inspection.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7IrLBQONyc2Y0APyRYH9wQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*QLYTVQ2GpR2u9JpE6XeekA.jpeg)

After clearing immigration and security, there was about an hour left to grab something to eat; I found a Thai restaurant and had my last meal in Thailand (seafood fried rice, mango juice, mango sticky rice).

> _Many shops sell mango sticky rice in takeout boxes after exiting, so if you don't have enough, you can buy some to eat on the plane!_

> _**\(⚠️ But remember, it is prohibited to bring it back to Taiwan ⚠️\)**_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ouwulscC2q0OsIujIa2iXg.jpeg)

This bottle of water deserves a close-up because the budget airline doesn't provide anything. I thought about buying water at the airport to drink, but after exiting, a bottle of mineral water costs THB 70 — 100, and this one costs THB 100.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*rOoff9qAZL6L4LjXH4DNfw.jpeg)

BKK is huge… filled with Trip.com advertisements. There were no delays on the return trip, and we took the shuttle bus to the terminal on time.

#### Back to Taiwan

Arriving at TPE Taoyuan International Airport, I picked up my luggage and came out around 20:45, then directly took the `1841` or `1819` Kuo-Kuang Motor Transport back to Taipei, which is very convenient without needing to transfer.

### ⚠️ Safety and Precautions for Traveling in Bangkok, Thailand ⚠️

The most important thing when going out is safety. Here’s a summary of safety tips and precautions.

#### Anti-Scam/Anti-Trap

[![The Eight Most Common Scams in Thailand Travel, Some Still Catching People! ](/assets/b7e7c0938985/07b5_hqdefault.jpg "The Eight Most Common Scams in Thailand Travel, Some Still Catching People!")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o42r-bg16Fg){:target="_blank"}

The following is a summary based on the video by Bangkok Cat. I encountered the currency exchange scam this time.

1. Miscalculating the bill  
   It may not be intentional; you can calculate the total amount when ordering.
   
2. Approaching you to show your country's currency or asking you to exchange money  
   When you take out your wallet, they may steal or pickpocket.
   
3. Outside the Grand Palace or attractions, falsely claiming the site is closed, enthusiastically introducing you to take a tuk-tuk to other (black temple/black shop/**private boat black boat, I encountered this at the pier**) places to scam you into spending.
   
4. Tuk-tuks, outrageous pricing, suddenly increasing the fare halfway  
   If you want to experience a tuk-tuk but are afraid of being overcharged, [you can try the new MUVMI app for tuk-tuk rides](https://bkk.com.tw/muvmi-app/){:target="_blank"}  
   Even if it looks like a good tuk-tuk, be wary of scam 3, where they enthusiastically introduce you to attractions or boat rides.
   
5. Fake staff  
   While waiting in line, fake staff may enthusiastically lure you inside, using your language to introduce dishes and help you order, then say you need to pay first and run off with your money.
   
6. Motorcycle and scooter rental scams  
   Do not leave your passport as a deposit, do not leave your passport as a deposit, do not leave your passport as a deposit.  
   If you encounter malicious scams claiming damage and asking for compensation, leaving your passport can be troublesome.  
   Or find a reputable chain rental company and take a video of the vehicle's condition before renting.
   
7. Local dating app scams  
   You might end up with a ladyboy, a honey trap, or a scammer.
   
8. Patpong ping pong show scam  
   Enthusiastic touts on the street asking if you want to see a ping pong show, saying you only need to order a 100 THB drink, then taking you into a dark alley or a second-floor black shop.  
   It's hard to watch, and when you want to leave, they ask for 3,000 THB, claiming there’s no such thing as a 100 THB drink.
   
9. Be cautious of pickpockets in crowded places, even in areas where you need to buy tickets to enter (e.g., Grand Palace, Wat Pho).

#### 🌿🚬

It will be banned next year, but I can share some experiences.  
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️ Edibles (like gummies) have a strong effect, and the scary part is that when you eat them, they feel just like regular gummies with no sensation, and they can suddenly hit you a few hours later ⚠️⚠️⚠️**  
- It's best to try gradually, eat 1/3... wait a few hours... if nothing happens, eat 2/3... wait a few hours... feel a little something, then try eating 1 whole...  
- Smoking also depends on your constitution; it's best to try gradually.  
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️ No matter what, it is strongly recommended to try it in the hotel; if you get high, you can rest directly, which is safer ⚠️⚠️⚠️**  
- Being able to drink does not mean you have a higher tolerance.  
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️** Your heart rate may increase and feel uncomfortable **⚠️⚠️⚠️**  
- It's safer to have someone awake to take care of you.  
- Only smoke in specific situations.

#### Others
- Thailand is not a tipping culture; generally, you don't need to tip. I only give a small tip of 20 THB for massages.
- Alcohol can only be sold from 11:00 to 14:00 and 17:00 to 24:00; it is prohibited all day on Buddhist holidays.
- Hotel balconies may not allow smoking; you need to ask.
- The emergency assistance phone number for foreigners is `1155`.
- SuperRich has business hours; if you arrive too early or too late, you won't be able to exchange money.

I didn't take many photos of the hotel, just one shocking photo of a large centipede I found in the blanket when I woke up in the morning.
### Day 2
#### [Santorini Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5e56XAK4en27bHbPA){:target="_blank"} (Closed)

[**【Hua Hin Seven Rock Attractions】Santorini Amusement Park: A Great Place for Photos in Thailand**](https://www.bring-you.info/zh-tw/santorini-park){:target="_blank"} 
[_On the way from Bangkok to Hua Hin, there is a Greek-style "Santorini Amusement Park" in the Seven Rock area, a popular spot for Thai families to stroll on weekends. If you love taking photos, I highly recommend visiting this incredibly romantic park._ www\.bring\-you\.info](https://www.bring-you.info/zh-tw/santorini-park){:target="_blank"}

It seems to be a small amusement park with Greek-themed scenery, along with a department store.
#### [Hua Hin Artist Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UcF7Wd82aHq4aGP86){:target="_blank"}

A quite famous attraction, still in operation in 2024.

There are many paintings and artworks.
#### Return to Sheraton Hotel to Enjoy Facilities and Beach

The hotel is in the form of villas, with each room being a standalone unit. The swimming pool surrounds every room in the hotel, and there is a bar next to the pool; the beach outside is an undeveloped area, barren and desolate.

After dinner, we opted for a buffet and went to explore the nearby night market.
### Day 3
#### [Maeklong Railway Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Jsbm5FFwYf2ArEW36){:target="_blank"}

It was too early, and everyone gave up on going.
#### [Damnoen Saduak Floating Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tKSTmHgaHc4YCbpZ6){:target="_blank"}

> 👉👉👉 **_These two attractions are not easily accessible; you can refer to the KKday itinerary:_**

I remember it was quite thrilling and adventurous, even though the water was murky and had an odor.
#### Heading to Bangkok to check in (2 days) at [Marriott Queens Park Bangkok](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Bzq2EGFrsxsRTKpj9){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*qy7YBGcWTMfpItXtapHr9g.jpeg)

The guide specifically told the staff not to step on my back. I remember it being very luxurious, but it was painful during the massage, making it hard to sleep. XD
#### [River City Shopping Complex](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L3Pnv1BpLCpcGs7G7){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7tYE57IoZUXg1gQhWuSa8g.jpeg)

Since we were going to the Chao Phraya Princess cruise + buffet dinner in the evening, we first stopped by the nearby department store to shop.
#### Chao Phraya Princess Cruise Buffet Dinner

The food was decent, but the main highlight was the beautiful night view, where you can see the lights of the Bangkok [Riverside Night Market Ferris Wheel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/evFHo6ciFY4jswSt9){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6pzhTRcjRh_b6Z4jOJH_fg.jpeg)

After returning to the hotel, I had a drink at the bar on top of the Marriott. I only remember the beautiful night view and the cheap drinks.

### Day 4 Free Day

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*NU2LiyNLR8lgf7phtPYKHg.jpeg)

I only remember visiting department stores, Big C, and Central World.

#### In the evening, I went to [Zoom Sky Bar at Anantara Sathorn Bangkok Hotel](https://www.kkday.com/zh-hk/product/105589-zoom-sky-bar-anantara-sathorn-bangkok-package?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} for a drink.

### Day 5 Return Trip

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*SpSAMDAk7Pp7SSCrmCyBQQ.jpeg)

This is the memory of the 2018 staff trip. This time, returning to Bangkok for a fully free trip made me more familiar with the city. Compared to my previous impressions, I feel it is more prosperous now, with better food, and prices have also increased.
