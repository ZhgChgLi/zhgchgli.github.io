### \[Travel Journal\] 2024 Bangkok, Thailand 🇹🇭 5-Day Free Trip

A quick five-day trip to Bangkok, Thailand after the pandemic.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*kRZZjY_7_6WaKRkw9E74iw.jpeg)

#### Memories of Bangkok

Let's rewind to 2018, when I went on my first company trip after entering the workforce, and my first trip abroad was to Bangkok, Thailand (5 days). The following year, in 2019, I joined another company trip to Sabah. Then came the two years stolen by the pandemic, and after it ended, I went crazy with trips to Japan.

Back then, I was a total newbie with zero social experience, blindly following my older siblings on outings. I didn't even know what I could or couldn't bring on a plane. At security, I clumsily placed my passport in the basket, only to realize it had fallen onto the conveyor belt when I exited the machine. I almost had a heart attack (if it had fallen into a gap, I wouldn't have been able to come back). That trip was a mindless group tour, and I don't have a clear impression of Bangkok. I only remember that the rooftop bars were amazing, the weather was hot, everything was cheap, and massages were affordable—nothing more, and I had no concept of the geography.

Thus, I always thought about returning to Bangkok to relive the memories from six years ago. However, I wasn't familiar with Southeast Asia and was hesitant to travel alone. **It just so happened that at the beginning of the year, while chatting with colleagues from Pinkoi, we decided to plan this five-day free trip to Bangkok.**

> _Details and memories from the 2018 Bangkok + Hua Hin five-day trip are included in the appendix at the end of the article._

Since I started a new job in June, I wasn't really focused on leisure activities. Mark and Sean were mainly responsible for the arrangements and planning, and I didn't do much research.

> **_⚠️⚠️⚠️ I've included safety tips and precautions for traveling in Bangkok at the end of the travel journal. You can skip the journal but make sure to understand the scams and precautions, especially if you're considering trying marijuana._**

#### Internet

This time, the preparation was rushed, and I hadn't set up my internet the day before. I didn't have time to buy my usual physical SIM card, so I decided to try eSIM for the first time. (I fell in love with it!)

I directly purchased the [**Thailand SIM Card | AIS 5G High-Speed Internet 8 Days Unlimited Data + Calls eSIM**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} on KKday, and after purchasing, I received the eSIM activation certificate right away, allowing me to use it immediately.

![[Thailand SIM Card | AIS 5G High-Speed Internet 8 Days Unlimited Data + Calls eSIM](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*AnowISXXahXxykkUUsugFw.png)

[Thailand SIM Card | AIS 5G High-Speed Internet 8 Days Unlimited Data + Calls eSIM](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}
- Limited-time promotional offer: From now until December 31, 2024, activating during the promotional period allows you to enjoy high-speed data of 15GB doubled to 30GB. After exceeding 30GB, the speed will drop to 384 Kbps, but you will remain connected.
- Unlimited calls within AIS, 50 THB call allowance. When using the following apps for text messaging, you can use an additional 10GB of data (10Mbps): TikTok, WeChat, and Instagram.
- **Has a physical number, can make calls, and receive SMS!**
- Calculation of days: 24-hour system, starts counting from when the eSIM is activated, with 24 hours considered one day (Thailand time).

[It's mainly an all-you-can-eat deal, cheaper than a physical SIM card, costing NT $232 for 8 days.](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}
#### Flight 🛫
- Outbound: TPE 16:00 -> BKK 18:45
- Return: BKK 15:20 -> TPE 20:10

Airline: Thai VietJet Air (low-cost airline)

Price: `TWD $9,259` (including an additional **15 kg** checked luggage)

Initially, I thought it would be better to travel with everyone. My friend didn't check in luggage (the ticket price was around `$6,000`), but later I checked other airlines and felt I missed out; regular airlines for similar times were around `$10,000`, not much difference, but much more comfortable!

Thai VietJet Air's luggage policy allows you not to check in luggage; you can carry two pieces of hand luggage, with a total weight not exceeding 7 kg.
```
1. Hand luggage weight:
Each passenger (except infants) can bring 1 piece of their own luggage and 1 small hand luggage, with a maximum total weight not exceeding 7 kg.

2. Hand luggage dimensions:
- 01 piece of hand luggage with maximum dimensions of 56cm x 36cm x 23cm
- 01 piece of small hand luggage (including the following bags)
  + 01 bag for girls, magazines, cameras, baby food bags, and bags purchased at the airport not exceeding 30cm x 20cm x 10cm.
  + 01 bag for coats that does not exceed 114cm x 60cm x 11cm when opened.
  + 01 bag for laptops with maximum dimensions of 40cm x 30cm x 10cm.
```

> [_Information as of 2024/08/22, everything is subject to the latest official announcements._](https://www.vietjetair.com/zh-TW/pages/%E8%A1%8C%E6%9D%8E%E8%A6%8F%E5%AE%9A-1607068164219){:target="_blank"}

Basically, just carrying a backpack and dragging a carry-on suitcase is sufficient.
#### Flight Change Notification on 8/1

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*fSzvcnbHkpMBgPMLq5kSWQ.png)

Received a flight change notification email on the night of 8/1, rescheduling the departure to 16:35 and arrival at 19:20.

### 8/02 Day 1 Departure
#### Departing from home around 12:30 PM

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*YsFObRlulrMFKHySvo3NAw.jpeg)

> _Remember to take the direct train to the airport; the regular train won't get you there faster, even if it's in the morning!_

#### Arriving at Taoyuan Airport Terminal 1 around 13:30

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*BBE4RhKU9tcJI427_LoQMw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ksagRFmStL9nLBWIyYY3Jg.png)

There was no one at the check-in counter, so I checked in and completed the baggage drop-off right away.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GI5u8vhrNRbFdG-XqY_2LQ.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*CBOJ0KHI4dMmAP5REh1UaA.jpeg)

Once again, it was B1R, the farthest corner, requiring a shuttle bus to the boarding gate.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XMQJOe1n5vyVdWQrYJpgNg.png)

With plenty of time before the 4 PM flight, I went to eat at the airport's Ding Tai Fung. This time I discovered that I could order individual dumplings, whereas before they only sold fried chicken!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*hfpWAbwiM2Aal3MZJ36oOA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XNjYtycibxeowQBaDT_jNw.jpeg)

I also found out that by walking straight ahead from Ding Tai Fung, I could access Terminal 2, so if you have time, you can walk to Terminal 2 for food; or Terminal 2 can come to Terminal 1 for the free VIP lounge XD.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t4dk8GQIv0D53N0V_qo7KA.png)

After finishing my meal, I went to the free VIP lounge in Terminal 1 to relax and eat. This time I saw someone charging their devices; [last time, all the outlets were taken, but it seems they have fixed it](../cb65fd5ab770/) (?).
#### Around 15:30, heading to the B1R waiting area

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*2Ros8CQBKj0-kkMugSZ7Hg.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*At7elbjIueB9lvvenvlfTA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*fpzrwzWez_HwgKFuFmDAhA.png)

I don't know if it's because it's a low-cost airline, but the information wasn't updated (it kept showing 16:00, but it had actually changed to 16:35).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*puKndBRQgCKs3LKbXbzEWw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*zCT2uidCELNc7WL1NpW72Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1aGwmjed9srQtHli3uDoxg.jpeg)

With the flight delayed, the actual departure time was 17:13.
- VietJet's seats are about the same size as Tigerair's, larger than Peach Aviation's, but the seats are uncomfortable, with non-breathable leather material that makes your butt hurt after sitting for too long.
- VietJet seems to allow you to bring your own food; on the return flight, someone was eating mango sticky rice without any issues.

#### 19:30 Arrival at Bangkok BKK Suvarnabhumi Airport

I learned from my colleagues that if you arrive at Bangkok Airport during peak hours, you can purchase the [**Thailand Airport BKK Departure Meet and Greet Fast Track Service**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/160605?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} for quick clearance XD. However, since we arrived at this time, there were almost only people from our flight, so the clearance was very fast.
#### 20:00 Baggage Claim and Exiting the Airport

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*QDvOtf4PsS-jSESOkb-0AA.jpeg)

Perhaps due to the low-cost airline, there weren't many people checking in, and baggage claim was super quick.
#### eSIM Network Setup

As soon as I exited the airport, I started figuring out how to set up and activate the eSIM, only to find out…

> **_⚠️ Activating eSIM requires an internet connection ⚠️_** 

> **_⚠️ Activating eSIM requires an internet connection ⚠️_** 

> **_⚠️ Activating eSIM requires an internet connection ⚠️_** 

It's a bit like buying a pair of scissors but needing another pair to cut it open; activating the eSIM requires an internet connection to enable it. Luckily, a friend traveling with me had already activated his eSIM in Taiwan, so I borrowed his internet to activate mine. \(The airport also has Wi-Fi available, so there's no need to worry too much\)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*_xv7JB_yl7d47ljrUTpYdw.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6vg_zfmf6tr3SIBUj6gi4A.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7-7yMcMgwbpNzBq1YgknaQ.png)

Once I found the eSIM activation, I just had to long-press the QR code and select "Add eSIM."

> **_I don't know why, but if you save the QR code to photos or notes, you lose the quick add feature. Another method is to send the QR code to a travel companion or print it out for your phone to scan._** 

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*hZBZoEJCLuHxEgbOVMEXBw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*_MctPE8uZYOdX5vnYoJnvg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*KMKLtNg2Aaeug_cn5fitNQ.jpeg)

iPhone iOS eSIM manual setup path: Settings -> Cellular -> Add eSIM -> Scan QR Code -> Manually enter information -> Use as... You can select "Travel" -> Choose "Travel" for mobile data -> Done!

Once activated, it’s like having dual SIMs, but the original SIM card has no internet until a roaming plan is purchased. **In case of emergency, you can switch back to the original SIM card!**
- [For AIS, dial \*545\# to check your phone number, \*121\# to check your balance, and \*121\*3\# to check your data](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}

#### 20:30 Finding Food at the Airport

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*mDPRItCdp28u5P6tTQelqQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*bgHNI9p20Jyf3t3IMDExMQ.jpeg)

Since it would take over an hour to get to the city and hotel, and the low-cost airline doesn't provide meals, everyone was quite hungry, so we decided to grab dinner at the airport.

We found a Thai restaurant to eat at; the spicy minced pork was delicious and paired well with the vegetable soup to ease the heat.
#### 21:00 Moving to the Hotel

> _👉👉👉 You can refer to KKday's airport transfer service:_ 

> _[\- Thailand | Airport Private Transfer | Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) / Don Mueang Airport (DMK) — Bangkok/Pattaya/Hua Hin City Hotels](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/3431-bkk-or-dmk-bangkok-private-transfer?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*cagHOMc-TKS9fmhN18zVOQ.png)

After finishing dinner around 21:00, we started moving towards the city and our hotel.

**Taking public transport requires three transfers on the subway and BTS:**
1. Airport Rail Link `Suvarnabhumi` -> `Phaya Thai`
2. BTS Sukhumvit Line `Phaya Thai` -> `Siam`
3. BTS Silom Line `Siam` -> `Chong Nonsi`

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OvL8K9OxwjMCVJ-3hYy2bw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*-eJ_rrYns2teWCITXTnhTA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*PeWlfQ6fd55mU1Ojk0isJQ.png)

- The Airport Rail Link only allows ticket purchases.
- You can buy a Rabbit Card (BTS transportation card) at the ticket window for recharging and tapping in and out.
- Please note that the **Rabbit Card can only be used on the BTS**, not on the MRT or Airport Rail Link.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*EF3IK_FXS4n3igDOsJ0C4A.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*jY4Jg6_vGhAM5CjPrVM-Iw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Dom8OdbMSRAAXtFpykCTZQ.png)

- Arrived at `Chong Nonsi` (later I found out that the King Power MahaNakhon building is at this station!)

#### Walking to [JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL](https://jckevin.com/){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6VrvZBTlo2gjg_lY7oQG8w.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*cgv3HGHsAkH8WL_jA6qTsg.jpeg)

When exiting the BTS, don’t rush down the overpass; you can walk across the road from the overpass.

> **_I felt it was quite dark along the way (not many streetlights), and it was a bit far to walk (15 mins / 1 KM). If walking alone at night, it can be quite scary._** _Along the way, you will pass a 7-Eleven and a small night market, where I bought some snacks to take back to the hotel._ 

> _Additionally, if taking a taxi, due to the two-way road and U-turn issues, the driver has to go a little past the hotel to the next gap to turn back, which is a bit of a hassle._ 

#### 10:30 Arrival at JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL

Arrived at the hotel around 10:30.

[![JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL](/assets/b7e7c0938985/43d8_hqdefault.jpg "JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg24V_VS6oA){:target="_blank"}

The room is very spacious, like a whole apartment, with a master bedroom, a second bedroom, two bathrooms, a kitchen, a living room, and a balcony.
#### Memories from 2018

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*E0aQK0xnj1XNpLGoOZFmsQ.jpeg)

Taken in 2018 / iPhone 6

What a coincidence! During the group employee trip to Bangkok in 2018, everyone specially took a taxi to the rooftop bar of this hotel XD.

Additionally, they also offer a Sky Bar dinner package:

#### 2024

Since I was staying here, after dropping off my luggage in the room, I ran up to take a look.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*h8ksUQqToXHPTda_RnwkSg.jpeg)

Since it was already past dinner time, I could only order some snacks and skewers.
### 8/03 Day 2 Wat Pho, Grand Palace, Wat Phra Kaew, Wat Arun, ICONSIAM, Lhao Lhao, Rock Pub Live
#### Hotel Breakfast

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7m7nqO5Q1kdTTPQsdx9TWg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t1xva8yggECe94znx32pew.jpeg)

After having breakfast at the hotel in the morning, I headed out. I thought the breakfast was okay, but there weren't many options.
#### 9:30 Departure

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*A2zezLiqIEOngnuebgxUjA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dZQvSlCNcBjgE4-mdnFZMQ.jpeg)

Since there were many people, we decided to take a Grab (THB 135) directly to Wat Pho.

On the way, we passed through [Chinatown](https://www.kkday.com/zh-hk/blog/101689/bangkokchinatown?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}, but I forgot to take a photo; it had a very cyberpunk vibe!

You need to take off your shoes to enter, and you can walk around the Reclining Buddha to pay your respects.
#### SuperRich Currency Exchange

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GKVidaEFygfEMNjfKFNweA.jpeg)

After leaving Wat Pho, I thought I would first solve the currency exchange issue. Only one friend in the group had exchanged some Thai Baht in advance; the others thought they would exchange in Bangkok. So after exiting, we walked to the nearby [The Old Siam Shopping Plaza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UPNxgoTmtswuhHVS8){:target="_blank"} to exchange money at SuperRich.

**⚠️ Please note: The Taiwanese dollars you want to exchange must not have stains, markings, etc., otherwise, they will be rejected for exchange. \(I happened to have a thousand-dollar bill from an ATM in Taiwan that had a pencil mark on it and was rejected for exchange\)**

> _NTD $5,000 exchanged for THB $5,200_

Khanom bueang Thai Pancake

After exchanging money, I had cash, so I replenished my energy at the food market on the first floor; I had a sweet Thai pancake \(ขนมเบื้อง\) filled with meringue, which was very sweet and tasted like cotton candy, along with a banana pancake; finally, I bought an iced coffee to continue my journey.
#### Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew

Entrance fee: THB 500/person.

Walking back to the Grand Palace (Wat Phra Kaew is within the Grand Palace), there are many government buildings along the way.

Grand Palace
#### 13:20 Lunch

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*NVu8tXAG7D3sGNRQi-PHGw.jpeg)

Around 13:00, after exiting the Grand Palace, we found a Western restaurant nearby towards the pier to have lunch.
#### 14:00 Preparing to Take the Boat to Wat Arun

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ePMFJ1jf5orPQRQTEJHMnQ.jpeg)

> **_⚠️ There will be people outside the pier trying to lure you, asking where you want to go. Be careful as they are private boat operators, charging high fees (THB 500, 1000) and are not safe; just ignore them and find the official pier and counter to tell them where you want to go. ⚠️_** 

> **_The official ticket price is only THB 30 (_** _`Tha Chang` **to Wat Arun), and the new boats have air conditioning, making them safe and comfortable.**_ 

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*oc8bbW-4ZZwQeFkqNhXwNw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ccUJ7WKGfb73k8UWEDNesg.jpeg)

When the boat arrives, the staff will announce "Wat Arun" (yes, in Chinese), and you can always ask if you're unsure.

The time is approaching afternoon, and a thunderstorm is on the way; you can see the water flow is muddy and rapid.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8hMHmiUOANTISYOVpTISiA.jpeg)

The boat is quite new, the air conditioning is cool, it's very safe and enclosed, and there are plenty of departures, making it very convenient!

Upon arrival, the staff will also announce "Wat Arun."

#### 14:30 Arrive at Wat Arun

Ticket price: THB 200

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*yO651kLqUcD8FPfH2KH1Sw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ujWr_UkXTX__M2jEz06sUw.jpeg)

After disembarking, you will find yourself at Wat Arun, where you can directly queue to buy tickets for entry.

> **_⚠️ Wat Arun also has a dress code ⚠️_** 

> **_No exposed shoulders, shorts, midriffs, or short skirts._** 

> **_You can wear traditional Thai clothing; many people wear it for photos._**

You can walk to the middle platform for photos (⚠️ the stairs are steep, so be careful). Many people also change into traditional Thai clothing here for memorable photos.

After the visit, head back to the pier and find the ticket booth (PIER 2) to buy a ticket for the boat to ICONSIAM (THB 40), then proceed to PIER 1 to board.

It's also a comfortable and safe new boat!
#### 15:00 ICONSIAM

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ms25D3MjSN_Mjxmlf7l4Yg.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*MbiMV91xnwXQqSTg4UUx1g.jpeg)

ICONSIAM is huge and looks very luxurious, with a unique food court on the first floor.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*fuuOJMUI4D8F0zPOEH1geg.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*eLZgR_Wmmnt0oWkwO-d-KQ.jpeg)

I bought a cup of ChaTraMue hand-brewed Thai milk tea to recharge.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*P-p65azTMpWowyRbZuyxhQ.png)

I strolled all the way to the BTS Charoen Nakhon platform, thinking I would get a foot massage for an hour.

There was a newer, larger place (1) THAI GARDEN MASSAGE outside the station, but they were fully booked; fortunately, I continued walking to (2) another massage shop, as shown in the picture; I found it very comfortable, less crowded, spacious, and quieter, with affordable rates (foot massage/1 hour/THB 270).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*s6--mVkXnO3wqrcTHRgL0Q.png)

After the massage, I had the energy to continue shopping, returning to ICONSIAM; I walked all the way to the upstairs restaurant, which is also quite extravagant, featuring a jungle, small bridges, and waterfalls—overall, it’s very nice!

> _I bought the famous Japanese fries, TORO FRIES (the line was long) to recharge._ 

> _They also have Japan's % coffee here._ 

#### Head to LHAO LHAO for dinner

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*FkVlLZzqOg0Q3j30Jvvppg.png)

This line is a branch with only three stops and less frequent service.

> _Google Maps seems to lack information about this BTS line; it suggested I walk to Krung Thon Buri._ 

From here, taking one stop to Krung Thon Buri connects to the Silom Line.

At Siam, I switched to the Sukhumvit Line and got off at Ari Station, where LHAO LHAO restaurant is just a short walk away.

The owner seems to be Chinese? It feels like a fusion of Chinese and Thai cuisine, and it’s a highly-rated old restaurant, apparently a favorite of Blackpink's LISA.

Since I needed to head to a pub for live music later, I ate quickly, but I found every dish delicious!!
- In the first three images, the background of the "Goose Brand Cooling Paste," the dish that looks like minced meat, is called หมูสับผัดหนำเลี้ยบ, which seems to be stir-fried minced meat with olive vegetables? It’s very good with rice!
- In the second image, the fried oyster omelet is similar to the fried oyster omelet from Taiwan's Shilin Night Market.
- In the second image, the seasonal limited drink is longan tea.
- In the second image, the most special dish is the crab curry (Panang Curry), made with a whole fresh crab.

> _The Goose Brand Cooling Paste recommended by Thais; I later bought a jar that smells smoother than a menthol nasal stick and has less nasal irritation!_

#### 20:00 [The Rock Pub](https://www.instagram.com/therockpub/){:target="_blank"}

After eating, I headed to The Rock Pub for drinks and live music.

I took a Grab to [Wang Chun Sheng Beef Hot Pot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1VuwzAdKS4vH6kmj6){:target="_blank"} for breakfast. The overall flavor is quite Chinese/Taiwanese, and I think it's good, but Tainan beef soup is even better.

> _After eating, I planned to go to Chatuchak Market, which is a bit far, so I didn't want to walk and transfer to BTS; I took an Uber instead (THB 374)._

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*0ofswmspB9w2vM7mII57_g.jpeg)

Chatuchak is quite large, with dense vendors, but overall it's clean and easy to navigate. However, many items are repetitive, and it seems like a lot of them are touristy "Made In China" products.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GJv4mk3v2-DptRofTF_9zg.jpeg)

In the end, I only bought a Thai brand, Phutawan indoor diffuser, as a souvenir.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*28EbS8N3OUJwSCPrgaTb8Q.png)

Feeling tired from shopping, I went into a massage shop for a foot massage plus some shoulder and neck massage (1 hour/THB 250).
#### Restroom

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*tGe2u5gIF70mPz3d7sX5XQ.jpeg)

If you need to use the restroom at Chatuchak, there are paid restrooms outside the market (THB 5 per use). I went in, and it was very clean, with one stall per person, and they are usually cleaned regularly. If you don't want to pay, you can go to the nearby [Mixt Chatuchak](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5PwQcFThBHtFpbzw6){:target="_blank"} mall, which has free and equally clean restrooms.

After eating, I continued to shop and bought a cup of durian juice, which had a rich and authentic flavor and was reasonably priced (THB 89).

> _I later found out that things at Chatuchak are actually cheaper; for example, the menthol nasal sticks here sell for 6 for $99, while Big C sells 6 for $140... and the durian juice is also cheaper; it sells for over $140 at night markets in the city._

#### 15:00 Take BTS to King Power Mahanakhon

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*A4V3CL5XvLoQ4sp487pJuQ.jpeg)

Chatuchak is closer to the MRT, but the King Power Mahanakhon we are going to is at BTS Chong Nonsi station; it takes about 1 KM (15 mins) to walk from Chatuchak to the nearest BTS Saphan Khwai station.
#### King Power Mahanakhon (Bangkok's King Power Mahanakhon)

Ticket price: THB 1,080 per person

It doesn't look as towering up close as I imagined, but the architectural style is very unique, more cyberpunk.

You need to go through a security check upon entry, and after buying the ticket, you get free luggage storage; backpacks cannot be taken up (small waist bags are allowed).

The direct elevator ride features a 360-degree scene animation, similar to Taipei 101 and the Tokyo Skytree; the height is about the same as Tokyo Tower.

The elevator first takes you to the indoor observation deck on the 74th floor, where there is a café and public seating for a short rest. To reach the outdoor observation deck on the 78th floor, you need to transfer to another elevator or take the stairs.

As soon as you arrive on the 78th floor, there is a small bar where you can order a drink and enjoy the view.

After exiting the 78th floor, you can continue up to the stairs and the rooftop lounge area.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dFRAU2mY_Qp9T0ru4GngIg.jpeg)

From the rooftop, you can enjoy a panoramic view of Bangkok, and you can imagine how beautiful the night view must be!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XOsqBu8PjCeB7XSlsD0_Fg.jpeg)

The stairs and rooftop lounge area face the famous transparent glass corridor, where you can see straight down to the ground. You can grab shoe covers from the nearby box to enter, but **it is prohibited to bring mobile phones; you can ask your companions or staff for help with taking photos.**

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*K2MOcxsrNbuNbz00sPfNOg.png)

The entire glass corridor is not very large, about the size of a rooftop infinity pool at a hotel. It doesn't feel very high when viewed from the side, but walking on it can still be a bit scary, making your legs feel weak XD

### Ratchada Night Market (formerly Ratchada Train Night Market)

![You can swipe your credit card directly at the MRT](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*BrfghHaJknyt6IiX7yOgbA.jpeg)

You can swipe your credit card directly at the MRT.

To get to Central Rama 9, you need to transfer to the MRT subway at Pharam 9 Station. The Rabbit Card cannot be used here; you need to buy a ticket or now you can use a VISA card to swipe in and out.

> _I tested the Taishin GoGo card, and it worked; I haven't tried the Cathay Cube._

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*c6Ug9F-JfXPzgnfvtvRvdg.jpeg)

For dinner, we came here to find something to eat. I must say that Bangkok's night markets and markets are far superior to those in Taiwan. The overall environment is clean, with seating areas, not chaotic, and well-planned, making it very comfortable to stroll around.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1cBlgC7kvmt1fWeMfiDVMA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OVMfzMU1HugpE0CVyUiSVw.jpeg)

After browsing around, we first tried the dessert on the left (similar to egg cake?) and the savory seafood grill on the right. Both were chewy and quite good.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*31mIDWp4WgTX8TSK5Q-C4Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*K3ZN-Kiwz4yTiNHiZ3P1bg.jpeg)

Next up was the main event: volcanic ribs. The flavor was quite unique, with a lemongrass and spicy sauce. You can just put on gloves and grab them to eat; it's very appetizing!

After eating, we bought coconut ice cream + mango + peanut dessert from other stalls, which was also delicious!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GamIzqKB9ROnECRfhPfA1Q.jpeg)

After eating, we strolled around Central Rama 9, where there is also the famous NaRaYa Bangkok bag.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*a5BcYS64yitoccK9TTU1HQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*csaO0X3lGf2TSIb3xQ8JWg.jpeg)

On the way back to the hotel, we happened to encounter a rain-soaked Bangkok with colorful digital advertising screens, creating a striking contrast in colors and a very cyberpunk feel.

#### 7-Eleven Hot Pressed Toast Late Night Snack

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*xQi9q1iA7o6FyfAeEISTEw.jpeg)

On the way back to the hotel, I tried Thailand's [hot pressed toast from convenience stores](https://supertaste.tvbs.com.tw/pack/347495){:target="_blank"} along with Thai banana milk. The filling was melted cheese with a hot dog, and the crust was flaky! It was really delicious and cheap!

### 8/05 Day 4 Central World, Big C, Terminal 21

> **_Did not sleep well all night + hungover all day, feeling dazed._**

#### Central World

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8pZ3crfkb4wIqZZOoI9-zA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6_evilQk4T0LdCYSIgBudg.jpeg)

In the morning, I headed out to Central World for shopping.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Sp3TTqnEx3yn6IM4H38NsQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*tmLvijY5Q7TVJbMo4D4XFg.jpeg)

On the first floor, there is a SHAKE SHACK burger place. I ordered the SHAKE SHACK signature burger and the coconut milkshake flavor exclusive to Bangkok for my first try. The burger was delicious and not greasy, but I found the milkshake too sweet.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OXOp4dN-5p9xS1ojcu0b9A.jpeg)

The place is quite large, and just like ICONSIAM, if you want to explore thoroughly, you won't finish in a day... I just bought a shirt on a whim.

#### Big C

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*JNswfx_h01UuffS299HjgQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GWD-HcYbLfAQEAN99tErsw.jpeg)

After shopping at Central World, I walked across to Big C to buy snacks and souvenirs. (There are many options, but I didn't find them cheaper...)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Bda3BGHI_ZeylIS96UNcWg.jpeg)

![Bottom left Phutawan indoor diffuser was bought yesterday at Chatuchak, but I guess it can also be found in department stores in the city.](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*aMillKlyevVx8fDncaurSA.png)

The bottom left Phutawan indoor diffuser was bought yesterday at Chatuchak, but I guess it can also be found in department stores in the city.

Additionally, Big C seems to no longer provide plastic bags, so you need to buy an eco-friendly bag in the store.

> _That pack of dried durian is large, but it actually only contains two small bags... However, it's quite tasty._

#### Lunch

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*z4VW1WOelH7UjBco9PIAqg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*qWWrZXa_LRClqCTi7bZK3Q.png)

There was a food market event at the outdoor plaza of Central World. It wasn't just a simple setup with tents; it had a theme, and this time it was Titanic. You can enter for free by following their official YouTube channel; the decorations inside were also very exquisite.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*9iurlEySgDL-ZQZzVGDiug.jpeg)

But for lunch, we went back to SHAKE SHACK and tried the chicken thigh burger this time, which was just as delicious.

#### Afternoon: Returned to the hotel for a nap because I didn't sleep well + hungover... I was really tired.

#### Dinner at Terminal 21 Shopping Mall

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8_lDD7yaIYIq7HV4zG4ClA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1T7njk_JYMi1eP1oMbjH-w.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*giNbQ1GPda-qPFaA8yQ7sQ.jpeg)

Terminal 21 is also a place you can never finish exploring. Each floor has a different regional theme; for example, the Japan floor mainly sells Japanese products and restaurants.

I mainly met up with [Chun-Hsiu Liu](https://medium.com/u/72361fccaa43){:target="_blank"} at the food court upstairs for a meal. ( **A highly recommended place for cheap and delicious food!** )

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ZyuBXqyjZtLw5zyVmarw6w.png)

At the food court, you just find a seat and sit down; many locals also come here to eat.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*a4MnqcM5Bi9jRPC3T29s5A.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*sYc87mPtI1nf3-9pk_F13w.png)

> _⚠️ **The payment method here is that the vendors do not collect money directly. You need to go to the counter to exchange cash for a food card, and then use the food card's QR code to pay; after eating, return to the counter for a refund. (No deposit or handling fee required)**_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*rt81B-Pc31OZeMlgG5M38Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*k1vmadbwhdJsJNmkllarLQ.jpeg)

There are many choices; just line up, tell them your number, and use the food card's QR code to pay; you can also take out (I remember there is an additional THB 10 packaging fee).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Ol8uiQNEnE9tuZc-qbgqgQ.jpeg)

I ordered seafood fried instant noodles (THB 50) + pork chop with fries (THB 59) = THB 109.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t2R762mSI8CeoDWpSAuEKg.jpeg)

After eating, I also took a box of mango sticky rice as a late-night snack to enjoy back at the hotel.

It was really delicious and cheap!!! A meal at a restaurant outside usually starts at THB 200–300, while here, most meals are around THB 50–80.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*G4G79vwVWj592tOApWbK2g.jpeg)

After eating, I went to the back to stroll around [Benjakitti Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bmKhQpbw9KTtLYeN8){:target="_blank"} and look for the legendary [Bangkok Monitor Lizard](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%B7%A8%E8%9C%A5%E4%BD%94%E9%A0%98%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8-%E8%A2%AB%E5%B0%81%E6%B3%B0%E7%89%88%E4%BE%8F%E7%BE%8E%E5%9C%92-104942584.html){:target="_blank"}; perhaps because it was nighttime, I didn't see a single one.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dMZhzj3rAqhRWAVuxeS0XQ.jpeg)

Back at the hotel, my travel companion bought some mangosteen to taste. I found the fresh ones delicious, with a subtle sweetness and the flavor of the mangosteen, very smooth. Later, I tried dried mangosteen, but it didn't taste great; it was just dry and sour.

> **_As for durians, the prices in Bangkok are not cheaper... a whole one is also THB 200 – 300._**

### 8/06 Day 5 Return Trip
#### Bangkok Monitor Lizard

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*E0M71hXTtQmzl2YP6kgPtw.jpeg)

In the morning, I was still determined and went to [Lumphini Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n53FhsjXUUJLnghn6){:target="_blank"} to look for the legendary Bangkok monitor lizard. Due to time constraints, I only found one medium-sized lizard that had just come out to bask in the sun.

> _Searching for the monitor lizard was just a personal whim of mine; it is said that locals really dislike these lizards (water monitor lizards) because they eat dirty things, so it's best not to touch them._

#### 12:00 Back to the hotel to pick up luggage and head to the airport

My flight is at 15:20, so I need to leave around noon. It takes about an hour to get from the city to the airport.

> _👉👉👉 You can refer to KKday for airport transfer services:_

The Grab fare from the hotel was THB 577, and we needed to take the highway; the driver would pay the toll first, and the final Grab charge would include the toll fee. (I remember it was about THB 50)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ENH0G1_tBNWy-8RHV9XCag.jpeg)

The checked baggage limit was only 15 kg, and I managed to stick to it.

After clearing immigration around 13:20, the security checks at Bangkok airport were quite strict; everything had to go through security, and carry-on bags were almost all opened for manual inspection.
```

After going through customs and security, I had about an hour to grab a bite to eat; I found a Thai restaurant for my last meal in Thailand. \(Seafood fried rice, mango juice, mango sticky rice\).

> _Many shops sell mango sticky rice in takeout boxes after you exit, so if you can't get enough, you can buy some to eat on the plane!_

> _**\(⚠️ But remember, it's prohibited to bring it back to Taiwan ⚠️\)**_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ouwulscC2q0OsIujIa2iXg.jpeg)

This bottle of water deserves a close-up because the budget airline didn't provide anything, and I thought I'd buy water at the airport. However, after exiting, bottled water costs THB 70 — 100, and this one was THB 100.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*rOoff9qAZL6L4LjXH4DNfw.jpeg)

BKK is huge... filled with Trip\.com advertisements. My return flight was on time, so I took the shuttle bus to the terminal.
#### Back to Taiwan

Arriving at TPE Taoyuan International Airport, I picked up my luggage and headed out around 20:45, directly taking the `1841` or `1819` Kuo-Kuang bus back to Taipei, which was very convenient without any transfers.
### ⚠️ Safety and Precautions for Traveling in Bangkok, Thailand ⚠️

The most important thing when going out is safety, so here’s a summary of safety tips and precautions.
#### Scam Prevention

[![The Eight Most Common Scams in Thailand, Some Still Catching Victims!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o42r-bg16Fg){:target="_blank"}](/assets/b7e7c0938985/07b5_hqdefault.jpg)

The following points are summarized from a video by the Bangkok Cat. I actually encountered a currency exchange scam this time.
1. Incorrect calculations
   It may not always be intentional; you can calculate the total amount when ordering.
2. Someone approaches you wanting to see your country's currency or asking to exchange money
   When you pull out your wallet, they might steal or snatch it.
3. Outside the Grand Palace or attractions, they falsely claim the site is closed and enthusiastically suggest taking a tuk-tuk to other places (black temples/black shops/ **private boat rides, I encountered this at the pier this time**).
4. Tuk-tuks, with sky-high prices, suddenly increasing halfway through the ride.
   If you want to experience a tuk-tuk but are afraid of being overcharged, [you can try the new MUVMI app for tuk-tuk rides](https://bkk.com.tw/muvmi-app/){:target="_blank"}.
   Even if a tuk-tuk looks good, be wary of scam 3, where they enthusiastically direct you to attractions or boat rides.
5. Fake staff, while waiting in line, fake employees may enthusiastically lure you inside.
   They will introduce dishes in your language, help you order, and then say you need to pay upfront, taking your money and running.
6. Motorcycle rental scams
   Do not leave your passport as a deposit, do not leave your passport as a deposit, do not leave your passport as a deposit.
   If you encounter malicious attempts to charge you for damages, leaving your passport can be troublesome.
   It's better to find a reputable rental company, and always take a video of the vehicle's condition before renting.
7. Local dating app scams
   You might end up meeting a ladyboy, a scammer, or worse.
8. Patpong ping pong show scams, where enthusiastic touts ask if you want to see a ping pong show, claiming you only need to order a drink for THB 100, then take you into a dark alley or a shady second-floor establishment.
   It's hard to leave, and when you want to go, they demand THB 3,000, claiming there's no such thing as a THB 100 drink.
9. Be cautious of pickpockets in crowded places, even in areas where you need to buy tickets to enter (e.g., Grand Palace, Wat Pho).

#### 🌿🚬

Next year it will be banned, but I can share some experiences.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️ Edibles (like gummies) have a strong effect, and the scary part is that while eating, it feels just like regular gummies, and it can suddenly hit you a few hours later ⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- It's best to try gradually, eat 1/3... wait a few hours... if nothing happens, eat 2/3... wait a few hours... feel a little something, then try eating one whole piece...
- Smoking should also be gradual based on your tolerance.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️ Regardless, I strongly recommend trying it only in your hotel; if you get high, you can rest directly, which is safer ⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- Being able to drink doesn't mean you can handle it better.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️** Your heart rate may increase uncomfortably **⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- It's safer to have someone sober around to take care of you if needed.
- Smoking is only appropriate in specific situations.

#### Other
- Thailand is not a tipping culture; generally, you don't need to tip. I only tip THB 20 for massages as a gesture.
- Alcohol can only be sold from 11:00 to 14:00 and 17:00 to 24:00; it's prohibited all day on Buddhist holidays.
- Hotel balconies may not allow smoking, so ask first.
- The emergency hotline for foreigners is `1155`.
- SuperRich has business hours, so if you arrive too early or too late, you won't be able to exchange money.

If you love taking photos, I highly recommend visiting this incredibly romantic park._ www\.bring\-you\.info](https://www.bring-you.info/zh-tw/santorini-park){:target="_blank"}

It seems like a small amusement park, with Greek-style scenery alongside a shopping mall.
#### [Hua Hin Artist Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UcF7Wd82aHq4aGP86){:target="_blank"}

A well-known attraction that is still open in 2024.

The hotel is in a villa style, with each unit being a standalone building. The swimming pool surrounds all the rooms, and there's a bar by the pool; the beach outside is undeveloped and desolate.

After dinner, we had a buffet and then went to explore a nearby night market.
### Day 3

It was too early, and everyone gave up on going.

I remember it being quite thrilling and adventurous, even though the water was murky and had a smell.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*qy7YBGcWTMfpItXtapHr9g.jpeg)

The guide specifically told the staff not to step on my back. I remember it being very high-end, but it was painful during the massage, and I couldn't sleep XD.
#### [River City Shopping Complex](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L3Pnv1BpLCpcGs7G7){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7tYE57IoZUXg1gQhWuSa8g.jpeg)

Since we were going to the Chao Phraya Princess cruise + buffet dinner in the evening, we first stopped by the nearby shopping mall to browse.
#### Chao Phraya Princess Cruise Buffet Dinner

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*EEELplqEfG3bLcGUoLAvRQ.jpeg)

I remember the food being decent, but the main highlight was the beautiful night view, where you could see the lights of the Bangkok [Riverside Night Market Ferris Wheel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/evFHo6ciFY4jswSt9){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6pzhTRcjRh_b6Z4jOJH_fg.jpeg)

After returning to the hotel, we went to the bar on the Marriott rooftop for a drink. I only remember the beautiful night view and the cheap drinks.
### Day 4 Free Day

I only remember going to shop at the mall, Big C, and Central World.
#### In the evening, went to [Zoom Sky Bar at Anantara Sathorn Bangkok Hotel](https://www.kkday.com/zh-hk/product/105589-zoom-sky-bar-anantara-sathorn-bangkok-package?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} for drinks.

### Day 5 Return Trip

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*SpSAMDAk7Pp7SSCrmCyBQQ.jpeg)

These are the memories from the 2018 employee trip. This time, returning to Bangkok for a fully free trip made me more familiar with the city. Compared to my previous impressions, I feel it has become more prosperous, the food is better, and prices have increased since then.
