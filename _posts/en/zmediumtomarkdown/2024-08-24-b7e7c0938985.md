### \[Travel Diary\] 2024 Bangkok, Thailand 🇹🇭 5-Day Free Trip

Returning to Thailand after the pandemic for a quick five-day trip to Bangkok.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*kRZZjY_7_6WaKRkw9E74iw.jpeg)

#### Memories of Bangkok

Let’s rewind to 2018, my first job and my first company trip, which was also my first time traveling abroad— a five-day trip to Bangkok and Hua Hin. The following year, in 2019, I joined another company trip to Sabah. Then came the two years stolen by the pandemic, after which I went crazy with trips to Japan.

Back then, I was a total newbie with zero social experience, blindly following my older siblings around. I didn’t even know what I could or couldn’t bring on a plane. At security, I clumsily placed my passport in the basket, only to realize it had fallen onto the conveyor belt when I exited the machine. I was nearly terrified (if it had fallen into a gap, I might not have made it back!). That trip was a mindless group tour, and my impressions of Bangkok were vague. I only remember the amazing rooftop bars, the hot weather, cheap goods, and affordable massages—nothing more, and I had no concept of the geography.

So, I always thought about returning to Bangkok to revisit those old memories from six years ago. However, I wasn’t very familiar with Southeast Asia and didn’t dare to travel alone. **It just so happened that at the beginning of the year, while chatting with colleagues from Pinkoi, we decided to plan this five-day free trip to Bangkok.**

> _I’ve included the details and memories from my 2018 Bangkok + Hua Hin trip in the appendix at the end of this article._

Since I started a new job in June, I wasn’t really focused on planning the trip. Mark and Sean took charge of the arrangements, and I didn’t do much research.

> **_⚠️⚠️⚠️ I’ve included safety tips and important notes for traveling in Bangkok at the end of the diary. You can skip the diary but make sure to understand the scams and precautions, especially if you plan to try marijuana._**

#### Internet

I was unprepared for this trip and didn’t have time to buy my usual physical SIM card, so I decided to try eSIM for the first time. (I fell in love with it!)

I purchased the [**Thailand SIM Card | AIS 5G High-Speed Internet 8 Days Unlimited Data + Calls eSIM**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} directly from KKday. After purchasing, I received the eSIM activation certificate immediately and was able to use it right away.

[Thailand SIM Card | AIS 5G High-Speed Internet 8 Days Unlimited Data + Calls eSIM](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}
- Limited-time promotional offer: From now until December 31, 2024, activating during the promotional period allows you to enjoy double high-speed data from 15GB to 30GB. After exceeding 30GB, the speed will drop to 384 Kbps, but you won’t lose connection.
- Unlimited calls within AIS network, 50 THB call allowance. When using the following apps for text messaging, you can use an additional 10GB of data (10Mbps): TikTok, WeChat, and Instagram.
- **You get a physical number, can make calls, and receive texts!**
- Duration calculation: 24-hour system, starts counting from the eSIM activation, with 24 hours considered as one day (Thailand time).

[It’s mainly unlimited data, cheaper than a physical SIM card, costing NT $232 for 8 days.](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}
#### Flight 🛫
- Outbound: TPE 16:00 -> BKK 18:45
- Return: BKK 15:20 -> TPE 20:10

Airline: Thai VietJet Air (low-cost airline)

Price: `TWD $9,259` (including an additional **15 kg** checked luggage)

Initially, I thought it would be better to travel with friends, who didn’t check in luggage (their ticket price was around `$6,000`). Later, I checked other airlines and felt I missed out; typical airlines for similar times were around `$10,000`, which isn’t much more but is definitely more comfortable!

Thai VietJet Air’s luggage policy allows you to carry two pieces of hand luggage, with a total weight not exceeding 7 kg.
```
1. Hand luggage weight:
Each passenger (excluding infants) can bring 1 piece of their own luggage and 1 small hand luggage, with a maximum total weight not exceeding 7 kg.

2. Hand luggage dimensions:
- 01 piece with maximum dimensions of 56cm x 36cm x 23cm.
- 01 small hand luggage (including the following bags):
  + 01 bag for girls, magazines, cameras, baby food bags, and bags purchased at the airport not exceeding 30cm x 20cm x 10cm.
  + 01 bag for outerwear that, when opened, does not exceed 114cm x 60cm x 11cm.
  + 01 bag for a laptop with maximum dimensions of 40cm x 30cm x 10cm.
```

> [_Information as of 2024/08/22, all subject to the latest official announcements._](https://www.vietjetair.com/zh-TW/pages/%E8%A1%8C%E6%9D%8E%E8%A6%8F%E5%AE%9A-1607068164219){:target="_blank"} 

Basically, I could just carry a backpack and pull a carry-on suitcase.
#### Flight Change Notification on 8/1

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*fSzvcnbHkpMBgPMLq5kSWQ.png)

Received a flight change notification email on the night of 8/1, rescheduling the departure to 16:35 and arrival at 19:20.

### 8/02 Day 1 Departure
#### Departing from home around 12:30 PM

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*YsFObRlulrMFKHySvo3NAw.jpeg)

> _Make sure to take the direct train to the airport; the regular train, even if it’s earlier, won’t get you there faster than the direct train!_ 

#### Arriving at Taoyuan Airport Terminal 1 around 13:30

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*BBE4RhKU9tcJI427_LoQMw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ksagRFmStL9nLBWIyYY3Jg.png)

There was no one at the check-in counter, so I checked in and completed the baggage drop-off right away.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GI5u8vhrNRbFdG-XqY_2LQ.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*CBOJ0KHI4dMmAP5REh1UaA.jpeg)

Once again, it was B1R, the farthest gate that required a shuttle bus.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XMQJOe1n5vyVdWQrYJpgNg.png)

With plenty of time before the 4 PM flight, I went to eat at the airport’s Ding Tai Fung. This time I discovered that I could order just the dumplings, which used to only sell fried chicken!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*hfpWAbwiM2Aal3MZJ36oOA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XNjYtycibxeowQBaDT_jNw.jpeg)

I also realized that if you walk straight ahead from Ding Tai Fung, you can reach Terminal 2, so if you have extra time, you can walk over there to grab a bite; or you can head to Terminal 2 for the free VIP lounge at Terminal 1 XD.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t4dk8GQIv0D53N0V_qo7KA.png)

After finishing my meal, I went to the free VIP lounge at Terminal 1 to relax and eat. This time I saw someone charging their devices; [last time I came, all the outlets were taken, but it seems they’ve fixed that](../cb65fd5ab770/) (?).
#### Around 15:30, heading to B1R waiting area

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*2Ros8CQBKj0-kkMugSZ7Hg.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*At7elbjIueB9lvvenvlfTA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*fpzrwzWez_HwgKFuFmDAhA.png)

I’m not sure if it’s because it’s a low-cost airline, but the information wasn’t updated (it kept showing 16:00, but it had actually changed to 16:35).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*puKndBRQgCKs3LKbXbzEWw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*zCT2uidCELNc7WL1NpW72Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1aGwmjed9srQtHli3uDoxg.jpeg)

With the flight delayed, the actual departure time was 17:13.
- VietJet’s seats are about the same size as Tigerair’s, larger than Peach Aviation’s, but the seats are uncomfortable, with non-breathable leather material that makes your butt hurt after sitting for too long.
- VietJet seems to allow you to bring your own food; on the return flight, someone was eating mango sticky rice without any issues.

#### 19:30 Arrival at Bangkok BKK Suvarnabhumi Airport

I learned from a colleague that if you arrive at Bangkok Airport during peak hours, you can purchase the [**Thailand Airport BKK Departure Meet and Greet Fast Track Service**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/160605?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} for a quick pass through immigration XD. However, since we arrived at this time, there were almost only people from our flight, so the immigration process was very quick.

#### 20:00 Baggage Claim and Exiting the Airport

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*QDvOtf4PsS-jSESOkb-0AA.jpeg)

Perhaps due to the low-cost airline, there weren't many people checking in, and baggage claim was super fast.

#### eSIM Network Setup

As soon as I exited the airport, I started figuring out how to set up and activate my eSIM, only to find out…

> **_⚠️ Activating eSIM requires an internet connection ⚠️_** 

> **_⚠️ Activating eSIM requires an internet connection ⚠️_** 

> **_⚠️ Activating eSIM requires an internet connection ⚠️_** 

It's a bit like buying a pair of scissors but needing another pair to cut the first one open; activating the eSIM requires an internet connection. Luckily, a friend traveling with me had already activated his eSIM in Taiwan, so I borrowed his internet to activate mine. (The airport also has Wi-Fi available, so there's no need to worry too much.)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*_xv7JB_yl7d47ljrUTpYdw.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6vg_zfmf6tr3SIBUj6gi4A.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7-7yMcMgwbpNzBq1YgknaQ.png)

Once I found the eSIM activation option, I just had to long-press the QR code and select "Add eSIM."

> **_I don't know why, but if you save the QR code to photos or notes, you lose the quick add feature. Another method is to send the QR code to a travel companion or print it out for your phone to scan._** 

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*hZBZoEJCLuHxEgbOVMEXBw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*_MctPE8uZYOdX5vnYoJnvg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*KMKLtNg2Aaeug_cn5fitNQ.jpeg)

iPhone iOS eSIM manual setup path: Settings -> Cellular -> Add eSIM -> Scan QR Code -> Manually enter information -> Use as... you can select "Travel" -> Choose "Travel" for mobile data -> Done!

Once activated, it’s like having dual SIMs, but the original SIM card has no internet until you purchase a roaming plan. **In case of emergency, you can switch back to the original SIM card!**
- [To check your AIS mobile number, dial *545#, to check your balance, dial *121#, and for data usage, dial *121*3#](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}

#### 20:30 Finding Food at the Airport

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*mDPRItCdp28u5P6tTQelqQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*bgHNI9p20Jyf3t3IMDExMQ.jpeg)

Since it would take over an hour to get to the city and hotel, and the low-cost airline doesn't provide meals, everyone was quite hungry, so we decided to grab dinner at the airport.

We found a Thai restaurant and had some food; the spicy minced pork was really hot but delicious, and the vegetable soup helped to ease the spiciness.

#### 21:00 Moving to the Hotel

> _👉👉👉 You can refer to KKday's airport transfer service:_ 

> _[\- Thailand | Airport Private Transfer | Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) / Don Mueang Airport (DMK) — Bangkok/Pattaya/Hua Hin City Hotels](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/3431-bkk-or-dmk-bangkok-private-transfer?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*cagHOMc-TKS9fmhN18zVOQ.png)

After eating, around 21:00, we started moving towards the city and our hotel.

**Taking public transport requires three transfers between the subway and BTS:**
1. Airport Rail Link `Suvarnabhumi` -> `Phaya Thai`
2. BTS Sukhumvit Line `Phaya Thai` -> `Siam`
3. BTS Silom Line `Siam` -> `Chong Nonsi`

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OvL8K9OxwjMCVJ-3hYy2bw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*-eJ_rrYns2teWCITXTnhTA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*PeWlfQ6fd55mU1Ojk0isJQ.png)

- The Airport Rail Link only allows ticket purchases.
- You can buy a Rabbit Card (BTS transport card) at the ticket counter for top-ups and tap in and out.
- Please note that the **Rabbit Card can only be used on the BTS**, not on the MRT or Airport Rail Link.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*EF3IK_FXS4n3igDOsJ0C4A.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*jY4Jg6_vGhAM5CjPrVM-Iw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Dom8OdbMSRAAXtFpykCTZQ.png)

- Arrived at `Chong Nonsi` (later I found out that the King Power MahaNakhon building is at this station!)

#### Walking to [JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL](https://jckevin.com/){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6VrvZBTlo2gjg_lY7oQG8w.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*cgv3HGHsAkH8WL_jA6qTsg.jpeg)

When exiting the BTS, don’t rush down the overpass; you can walk across the road from the overpass.

> **_I felt it was quite dark along the way (not many streetlights), and it was a bit far to walk (15 mins / 1 KM). If walking alone at night, it can be quite scary._** _ Along the way, I passed a 7-Eleven and a small night market, where I bought some snacks to take back to the hotel._ 

> _Also, if taking a taxi, due to the two-way road and U-turn issues, the driver has to go past the hotel a bit to the next gap to turn back, which can be a bit of a hassle._ 

#### 10:30 Arrival at JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL

I arrived at the hotel around 10:30.

[![JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL](/assets/b7e7c0938985/43d8_hqdefault.jpg "JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg24V_VS6oA){:target="_blank"}

The room is very spacious, like a full apartment with a master bedroom, a second bedroom, two bathrooms, a kitchen, a living room, and a balcony.

#### Memories from 2018

What a coincidence! During a company trip to Bangkok in 2018, we all took a taxi to the rooftop bar at this hotel XD.

Additionally, they offer a Sky Bar dinner package:

#### 2024

Since I’m staying here, after dropping off my luggage in the room, I went up to take a look.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*h8ksUQqToXHPTda_RnwkSg.jpeg)

Since it was already past dinner time, I could only order some appetizers and skewers.

### 8/03 Day 2 Wat Pho, Grand Palace, Wat Phra Kaew, Wat Arun, ICONSIAM, Lhao Lhao, Rock Pub Live

#### Hotel Breakfast

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t1xva8yggECe94znx32pew.jpeg)

After having breakfast at the hotel, I headed out. I thought the breakfast was okay, but there weren't many options.

#### 9:30 Departure

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*A2zezLiqIEOngnuebgxUjA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dZQvSlCNcBjgE4-mdnFZMQ.jpeg)

Since there were many of us, we took a Grab (THB 135) directly to Wat Pho.

On the way, we passed through [Chinatown](https://www.kkday.com/zh-hk/blog/101689/bangkokchinatown?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}, but I forgot to take photos; it had a very cyberpunk vibe!

You need to take off your shoes to enter, and you can walk around the Reclining Buddha to pay your respects.

#### SuperRich Currency Exchange

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GKVidaEFygfEMNjfKFNweA.jpeg)

After leaving Wat Pho, I thought I should solve the currency exchange issue first. Only one friend had exchanged some Thai Baht in advance; the others planned to exchange in Bangkok. So, we walked to the nearby [The Old Siam Shopping Plaza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UPNxgoTmtswuhHVS8){:target="_blank"} to exchange money at SuperRich.

**⚠️ Please note: The Taiwanese dollars you want to exchange must not have stains, markings, etc., otherwise they will be rejected. (I happened to have a thousand-dollar bill from an ATM in Taiwan that had a pencil mark on it and was rejected for exchange.)**

> _NTD $5,000 exchanged for THB $5,200_

![Khanom bueang Thai Pancakes](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*kf2ELPmE7JF_zCPV6pI_uw.jpeg)

Khanom bueang Thai Pancakes

After exchanging money, we had cash, so we replenished our energy at the food market on the first floor; I had sweet Thai pancakes (ขนมเบื้อง) filled with meringue, which were very sweet and tasted like cotton candy, along with a banana pancake; finally, I bought an iced coffee to continue our journey.

#### Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew

Entrance fee: THB 500/person.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*NVu8tXAG7D3sGNRQi-PHGw.jpeg)

Around 13:00, after exiting the Grand Palace, we found a Western restaurant nearby towards the pier to have lunch.

#### 14:00 Preparing to Take the Boat to Wat Arun

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ePMFJ1jf5orPQRQTEJHMnQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*J5lIB0rYWPqPWrgkkNlB2g.jpeg)

> **_⚠️ Outside the pier, there will be people trying to solicit you, asking where you're going. Be careful, as they may be private boat operators who charge high fees (THB 500, 1000) and are not safe; just ignore them and find the official pier and tell the staff where you want to go. ⚠️_** 

> **_The official ticket price is only THB 30 (_** _`Tha Chang` **to Wat Arun), and the new boats have air conditioning, making them safe and comfortable.**_ 

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*oc8bbW-4ZZwQeFkqNhXwNw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ccUJ7WKGfb73k8UWEDNesg.jpeg)

When the boat arrives, the staff will announce "Wat Arun" (yes, in Chinese), and you can ask anytime if you're unsure.

The storm is approaching in the afternoon, and you can see the water flowing rapidly and murkily.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8hMHmiUOANTISYOVpTISiA.jpeg)

The boat is new, the air conditioning is cool, it's safely enclosed, and there are plenty of departures, making it very convenient!

Upon arrival, the staff will also announce "Wat Arun."

#### 14:30 Arrive at Wat Arun

Ticket price: THB 200

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ujWr_UkXTX__M2jEz06sUw.jpeg)

After disembarking, you will find yourself at Wat Arun, where you can line up to buy tickets for entry.

> **_⚠️ Dress code applies at Wat Arun ⚠️_** 

> **_No bare shoulders, shorts, midriffs, or short skirts._** 

> **_You can wear traditional Thai clothing; many people wear it for photos._**

You can walk to the middle platform for photos (⚠️ the stairs are steep, so be careful). Many people also change into traditional Thai clothing to take pictures here.

After the visit, head back to the pier and find the ticket booth (PIER 2) to buy a ticket to ICONSIAM (THB 40), then proceed to PIER 1 to board.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*MbiMV91xnwXQqSTg4UUx1g.jpeg)

ICONSIAM is huge and looks very luxurious, with a unique food court on the first floor.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*eLZgR_Wmmnt0oWkwO-d-KQ.jpeg)

I bought a cup of ChaTraMue Thai milk tea to recharge.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*P-p65azTMpWowyRbZuyxhQ.png)

I strolled to the BTS Charoen Nakhon platform, thinking of getting a foot massage for an hour.

There was a newer, larger place (1) THAI GARDEN MASSAGE outside the station, but they were fully booked; fortunately, I continued walking to (2) another massage shop, as shown in the picture. I found it very comfortable, less crowded, spacious, and quieter, with a cheap rate (foot massage/1 hour/THB 270).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*s6--mVkXnO3wqrcTHRgL0Q.png)

After the massage, I had the energy to continue shopping and returned to ICONSIAM; I walked to the restaurant upstairs, which was also quite extravagant, featuring a jungle, small bridges, and waterfalls—overall, it was very nice!

> _I bought the famous Japanese fries, TORO FRIES (the line was long) to recharge._ 

> _They also have % coffee from Japan here._ 

#### Head to LHAO LHAO for dinner

This line is a branch with only three stations and less frequent service.

> _Google Maps seems to lack information about this BTS line; it suggested I walk to Krung Thon Buri._ 

From here, taking one stop to Krung Thon Buri connects to the Silom Line.

At Siam, I switched to the Sukhumvit Line and got off at Ari Station, which is just a short walk to LHAO LHAO restaurant.

The owner seems to be Chinese? It feels like a fusion of Chinese and Thai cuisine, and it’s a highly-rated old restaurant, reportedly a favorite of Blackpink's Lisa.

Since I was heading to a pub to listen to live music later, I ate a bit quickly, but I found every dish delicious!
- In the first three images, the dish called หมูสับผัดหนำเลี้ยบ, which looks like minced meat with olives, is very tasty with rice!
- In the second image, the fried oyster omelet is similar to the Taiwanese fried oyster omelet from Shilin Night Market.
- In the second image, the seasonal drink is longan tea.
- In the second image, the most special dish is the crab curry (Panang Curry), made with a whole fresh crab.

> _The recommended dish, the minced meat with olives, was so good that I later bought a jar; it smells smoother than a menthol stick and doesn’t irritate the nasal passages as much!_

I took a Grab to [Wang Chun Sheng Beef Hot Pot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1VuwzAdKS4vH6kmj6){:target="_blank"} for breakfast. The overall flavor is quite Chinese/Taiwanese, and I think it's good, but Tainan beef soup is even better.

> _After eating, I headed to Chatuchak Market, which is a bit far, so I didn’t want to walk and transfer to BTS; I took an Uber instead (THB 374)._

Chatuchak is vast, with dense stalls, but overall it’s clean and easy to navigate. However, many items are repetitive, and it seems a lot of them are touristy Made In China products.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GJv4mk3v2-DptRofTF_9zg.jpeg)

In the end, I only bought a Thai brand, Phutawan indoor diffuser, as a souvenir.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*28EbS8N3OUJwSCPrgaTb8Q.png)

Feeling tired from shopping, I went into a massage shop for a foot and some shoulder and neck massage (1 hour/THB 250).
#### Restroom

If you need to use the restroom at Chatuchak, there are paid restrooms outside the market (THB 5 per use). I went in, and it was very clean, with one stall per person, and they are generally cleaned regularly. If you don’t want to pay, you can go to the nearby [Mixt Chatuchak](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5PwQcFThBHtFpbzw6){:target="_blank"} mall, which has free and equally clean restrooms.

After eating, I continued to shop and bought a cup of durian juice, which was rich and authentic in flavor and reasonably priced (THB 89).

> _I later found out that items at Chatuchak are actually cheaper; for example, a pack of six menthol sticks sells for $99 here, while Big C sells them for $140… and the durian juice is also cheaper, as it sells for over $140 in downtown night markets._ 

#### 15:00 Take BTS to King Power Mahanakhon

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*A4V3CL5XvLoQ4sp487pJuQ.jpeg)

Chatuchak is closer to the MRT, but we need to go to King Power Mahanakhon, which is at BTS Chong Nonsi station; it takes about 1 KM (15 mins) to walk from Chatuchak to the nearest BTS Saphan Khwai station.
#### King Power Mahanakhon (Bangkok's King Power Tower)

Ticket price: THB 1,080 per person

Up close, it doesn't seem as towering as I imagined, but the architectural style is quite unique, resembling a cyberpunk aesthetic.

Upon entering, you must go through a security check. After purchasing tickets, you can store your belongings for free; backpacks are not allowed upstairs (small waist bags are permitted).

The direct elevator has a 360-degree scene animation similar to Taipei 101 and the Tokyo Skytree; the height is about the same as Tokyo Tower.

Here's the translation of the provided text into naturalistic English, while keeping the original markdown image sources and URL links intact:

---

The elevator first takes you to the indoor observation deck on the 74th floor, where there's a café and some public seating for a short rest. To reach the outdoor observation deck on the 78th floor, you need to take another elevator or walk up the stairs.

As soon as you arrive on the 78th floor, there's a small bar where you can order a drink and enjoy the view.

After exiting the 78th floor, you can continue up to the stairs and the rooftop lounge area.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dFRAU2mY_Qp9T0ru4GngIg.jpeg)

From the rooftop, you can enjoy a panoramic view of Bangkok, and I can only imagine how beautiful the night view must be!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XOsqBu8PjCeB7XSlsD0_Fg.jpeg)

The stairs and rooftop lounge area face the famous transparent glass corridor, where you can see straight down to the ground. You can grab shoe covers from the nearby box to enter, but **phones are not allowed inside; you can ask someone accompanying you or staff for help with photos.**

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*K2MOcxsrNbuNbz00sPfNOg.png)

The entire glass corridor isn't very large, about the size of a rooftop infinity pool at a hotel. It doesn't feel too high when viewed from the side, but walking on it can still be a bit nerve-wracking, making your legs feel a little weak. XD

### Ratchada Night Market (originally Ratchada Train Night Market)

![You can swipe your credit card directly at the MRT](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*BrfghHaJknyt6IiX7yOgbA.jpeg)

You can swipe your credit card directly at the MRT.

To get to Central Rama 9, you need to transfer to the MRT subway at Pharam 9 Station. The Rabbit Card cannot be used here, so you'll need to buy a ticket or you can now use a VISA card to enter and exit directly.

> _I tested the Taishin GoGo card, and it worked; I haven't tried the Cathay Cube._

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*c6Ug9F-JfXPzgnfvtvRvdg.jpeg)

For dinner, we came here to find something to eat. I must say that Bangkok's night markets and markets are far superior to those in Taiwan. The overall environment is clean, with seating areas, and it's well-organized, making it very comfortable to stroll around.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1cBlgC7kvmt1fWeMfiDVMA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OVMfzMU1HugpE0CVyUiSVw.jpeg)

After browsing around, we first tried the dessert on the left (similar to egg cakes?) and the savory seafood grill on the right. Both were quite chewy and tasty.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*31mIDWp4WgTX8TSK5Q-C4Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*K3ZN-Kiwz4yTiNHiZ3P1bg.jpeg)

Next up was the highlight: volcanic ribs. The flavor was quite unique, with a tangy lemongrass sauce. You can just put on gloves and dig in with your hands—it's very appetizing!

After eating, we bought coconut ice cream with mango and peanut dessert from another stall, which was also delicious!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GamIzqKB9ROnECRfhPfA1Q.jpeg)

Afterward, we went back to Central Rama 9 to take a look. There's also the famous NaRaYa Bangkok bags here.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*a5BcYS64yitoccK9TTU1HQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*csaO0X3lGf2TSIb3xQ8JWg.jpeg)

On the way back to the hotel, we happened to encounter Bangkok after a rain shower, with colorful digital billboards creating a striking contrast—very cyberpunk!

#### 7-Eleven Hot Pressed Toast for Late Night Snack

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*xQi9q1iA7o6FyfAeEISTEw.jpeg)

On the way back to the hotel, I tried Thailand's [hot pressed toast from convenience stores](https://supertaste.tvbs.com.tw/pack/347495){:target="_blank"} along with Thai banana milk. The filling was melted cheese with a hot dog, and the crust was flaky! It was really delicious and cheap!

### 8/05 Day 4 Central World, Big C, Terminal 21

> **_Didn’t sleep well all night + hungover all day, feeling a bit dazed._**

#### Central World

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8pZ3crfkb4wIqZZOoI9-zA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6_evilQk4T0LdCYSIgBudg.jpeg)

In the morning, I headed out to Central World for some shopping.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Sp3TTqnEx3yn6IM4H38NsQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*tmLvijY5Q7TVJbMo4D4XFg.jpeg)

On the first floor, there's a SHAKE SHACK burger joint. I ordered the signature SHAKE SHACK burger and a coconut milkshake that’s unique to Bangkok. The burger was tasty and not greasy, but I found the milkshake a bit too sweet.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OXOp4dN-5p9xS1ojcu0b9A.jpeg)

The place is quite large, and like ICONSIAM, you could spend a lot of time exploring it… I just quickly bought a shirt.

#### Big C

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*JNswfx_h01UuffS299HjgQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GWD-HcYbLfAQEAN99tErsw.jpeg)

After finishing at Central World, I walked across to Big C to buy snacks and souvenirs. (There are many options, but I didn’t find them much cheaper…)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Bda3BGHI_ZeylIS96UNcWg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*DWtvvjZ3iAwk5U3MPZDudg.jpeg)

![Bottom left: Phutawan indoor diffuser was bought yesterday at Chatuchak, but I guess you can find it in department stores in the city too.](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*aMillKlyevVx8fDncaurSA.png)

The bottom left Phutawan indoor diffuser was purchased yesterday at Chatuchak, but I suspect it’s available in city department stores as well.

Additionally, it seems that Big C no longer provides plastic bags, so you have to buy eco-friendly bags in the store.

> _That durian chips bag is big, but when you open it, there are actually only two small bags inside… but they are quite tasty._

#### Lunch

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*z4VW1WOelH7UjBco9PIAqg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*qWWrZXa_LRClqCTi7bZK3Q.png)

In the outdoor plaza of Central World, there was a food market event. It wasn’t just a simple setup with tents; it had a theme, and this time it was Titanic. You could enter for free by following their official YouTube channel; the decorations inside were also very elaborate.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*9iurlEySgDL-ZQZzVGDiug.jpeg)

But for lunch, we ended up eating at SHAKE SHACK again, this time opting for the chicken thigh burger, which was just as delicious.

#### Afternoon: Returned to the hotel for a nap because I didn’t sleep well and was hungover… just too tired.

#### Dinner at Terminal 21

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8_lDD7yaIYIq7HV4zG4ClA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1T7njk_JYMi1eP1oMbjH-w.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*giNbQ1GPda-qPFaA8yQ7sQ.jpeg)

Terminal 21 is also a place you could spend a lot of time exploring; each floor has a different regional theme. For example, the Japan floor mainly sells Japanese products and restaurants.

I mainly met up with [Chun-Hsiu Liu](https://medium.com/u/72361fccaa43){:target="_blank"} at the food court upstairs for a meal. ( **A highly recommended place for cheap and delicious food!** )

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ZyuBXqyjZtLw5zyVmarw6w.png)

In the food court, you find your own seat, and many locals come here to eat as well.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*a4MnqcM5Bi9jRPC3T29s5A.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*sYc87mPtI1nf3-9pk_F13w.png)

> _⚠️ **The payment method here is unique; the vendors don’t collect money directly. You need to go to the counter to exchange cash for a food card, and then you pay with the QR code on the food card. After eating, return to the counter to return the card for a refund. (No deposit or service fee required.)**_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*rt81B-Pc31OZeMlgG5M38Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*k1vmadbwhdJsJNmkllarLQ.jpeg)

There are many options to choose from; just line up, tell them your number, and pay with the food card QR code. You can also take it to go (I remember there’s an additional THB 10 packaging fee).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Ol8uiQNEnE9tuZc-qbgqgQ.jpeg)

I ordered seafood fried instant noodles (THB 50) + pork chop with fries (THB 59) = THB 109.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t2R762mSI8CeoDWpSAuEKg.jpeg)

After eating, I also took a box of mango sticky rice to enjoy as a late-night snack back at the hotel.

It was really delicious and cheap!!! A meal at a restaurant outside usually starts at THB 200–300, while here, most meals are around THB 50–80.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*G4G79vwVWj592tOApWbK2g.jpeg)

After eating, we went to the nearby [Benjakitti Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bmKhQpbw9KTtLYeN8){:target="_blank"} for a stroll, hoping to spot the legendary [Bangkok monitor lizard](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%B7%A8%E8%9C%A5%E4%BD%94%E9%A0%98%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8-%E8%A2%AB%E5%B0%81%E6%B3%B0%E7%89%88%E4%BE%8F%E7%BE%8E%E5%85%AC%E5%9C%92-104942584.html){:target="_blank"}; perhaps because it was nighttime, we didn’t see a single one.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dMZhzj3rAqhRWAVuxeS0XQ.jpeg)

Back at the hotel, my travel companion bought some mangosteen to try. I found the fresh ones delicious, with a subtle sweetness combined with the flavor of the mangosteen, very smooth. Later, I tried dried mangosteen, but it wasn’t as good—just dry and sour.

> **_As for durians, the prices in Bangkok aren’t any cheaper… a whole one is still THB 200 – 300._**

### 8/06 Day 5 Return Trip
#### Bangkok Monitor Lizard

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*E0M71hXTtQmzl2YP6kgPtw.jpeg)

In the morning, I was determined and went to [Lumpini Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n53FhsjXUUJLnghn6){:target="_blank"} to find the legendary Bangkok monitor lizard. Due to time constraints, I only found one medium-sized lizard that had just come out to sunbathe.

> _Looking for the monitor lizard was just a personal whim of mine; locals reportedly dislike these lizards (water monitors) because they eat dirty things, so it’s best not to touch them._

#### 12:00 Back to the hotel to grab luggage and head to the airport

My flight is at 15:20, so I need to leave by noon. It takes about an hour to get from the city to the airport.

> _👉👉👉 You can refer to KKday for airport transfer services:_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*BPuL4q7P2JhBF5gow8wBwg.jpeg)

The Grab fare from the hotel was THB 577, and we needed to get on the highway; the driver paid the toll first, and the final Grab charge would include the toll fee. (I think it was around THB 50.)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ENH0G1_tBNWy-8RHV9XCag.jpeg)

The checked baggage limit was only 15 kg, and I managed to stick to that.

After clearing immigration around 13:20, the security checks at Bangkok airport were quite strict; everything had to go through security, and carry-on bags were almost all opened for manual inspection.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*QLYTVQ2GpR2u9JpE6XeekA.jpeg)

After going through immigration and security checks, I had about an hour to grab a bite to eat. I found a Thai restaurant and enjoyed my last meal in Thailand: seafood fried rice, mango juice, and mango sticky rice.

> _Many shops sell mango sticky rice in takeout boxes after you exit, so if you can't get enough, you can buy some to eat on the plane!_

> _**\(⚠️ But remember, it's prohibited to bring it back to Taiwan ⚠️\)**_

I have to give this bottle of water a close-up because the budget airline doesn't provide anything, and I thought I'd buy water at the airport. However, after exiting, a bottle of mineral water costs THB 70 — 100, and this one was THB 100.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*rOoff9qAZL6L4LjXH4DNfw.jpeg)

BKK is huge… filled with Trip.com advertisements. My return flight was on time, so I took the shuttle bus to the terminal.
#### Back in Taiwan

Arriving at TPE Taoyuan International Airport, I picked up my luggage and headed straight to catch the `1841` or `1819` Kuo-Kuang bus back to Taipei. It was very convenient without needing to transfer.
### ⚠️ Safety and Precautions for Traveling in Bangkok, Thailand ⚠️

The most important thing when going out is safety, so here’s a summary of safety tips and precautions.
#### Scam Prevention

[![Common scams in Thailand that people still fall for!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o42r-bg16Fg){:target="_blank"}](/assets/b7e7c0938985/07b5_hqdefault.jpg)

The following points are summarized from a video by Bangkok Cat. I personally encountered a currency exchange scam during this trip.
1. Incorrect calculations
   It may not always be intentional; you can calculate the total amount when ordering.
2. Someone approaches you wanting to see your country's currency or asking to exchange money
   When you pull out your wallet, they might steal or pickpocket you.
3. Outside the Grand Palace or attractions, someone falsely claims the site is closed and enthusiastically suggests taking a tuk-tuk to other places (black temples/black shops/ **I encountered a private boat scam at the pier this time**).
4. Tuk-tuks, outrageous prices, or sudden fare increases halfway through the ride.
   If you want to experience a tuk-tuk but are worried about being overcharged, [you can try the new MUVMI app for tuk-tuk rides](https://bkk.com.tw/muvmi-app/){:target="_blank"}.
   Even if a tuk-tuk looks good, be cautious of scam #3, where they enthusiastically suggest you visit attractions or take a boat ride.
5. Fake staff members will enthusiastically lure you into their restaurant while you wait in line.
   They will introduce the menu in your language, help you order, and then say you need to pay upfront, taking your money and running.
6. Motorcycle rental scams
   Do not leave your passport as a deposit, do not leave your passport as a deposit, do not leave your passport as a deposit.
   If you encounter malicious scams claiming damage and asking for compensation, leaving your passport can lead to trouble.
   It's better to rent from reputable chain rental companies and take a video of the vehicle's condition before renting.
7. Local dating app scams
   You might end up meeting a ladyboy, a scammer, or someone with bad intentions.
8. Patpong ping pong show scams, where enthusiastic touts ask if you want to see a ping pong show, claiming you only need to buy a 100 THB drink, then take you into a dark alley or a shady establishment.
   It's hard to leave, and when you try, they demand 3,000 THB, claiming there was no 100 THB deal.
9. Be cautious of pickpockets in crowded places, even in areas where you need to buy tickets to enter (e.g., Grand Palace, Wat Pho).

#### 🌿🚬

Next year it will be banned, but I can share some experiences.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️ Edibles (like gummies) have a strong effect, and the scary part is that they feel just like regular gummies when you eat them, but the effects can hit you suddenly after a few hours ⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- It's best to try them gradually: eat 1/3, wait a few hours, if nothing happens, eat 2/3, wait a few hours, feel a little something, then try eating one whole piece…
- Smoking should also be approached gradually, depending on your tolerance.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️ Regardless, I strongly recommend trying them only in your hotel; if you feel out of it, you can rest right away, which is safer ⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- Just because you drink doesn't mean you have a higher tolerance.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️** Your heart rate may increase and feel uncomfortable **⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- It's safer to have someone sober around to take care of you if needed.
- Only smoke in specific situations.

#### Other Tips
- Thailand is not a tipping culture, so generally, you don't need to tip; I only leave a THB 20 tip for massages as a gesture.
- Alcohol can only be sold from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM and from 5:00 PM to midnight; it's prohibited all day on Buddhist holidays.
- Not all hotel balconies allow smoking, so be sure to ask.
- The emergency hotline for foreigners is `1155`.
- SuperRich has specific business hours, so if you arrive too early or too late, you won't be able to exchange money.

It seems like a small amusement park with Greek-style scenery.
#### [Hua Hin Artist Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UcF7Wd82aHq4aGP86){:target="_blank"}

A well-known attraction that is still open in 2024.

There are many paintings and artworks.
#### Back to Sheraton to enjoy the facilities and beach

The hotel is in a villa style, with each room being a standalone unit. The swimming pool surrounds all the rooms, and there's a bar by the pool; the beach outside is undeveloped and desolate.

After dinner, we went to the nearby night market.
### Day 3
#### [Maeklong Railway Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Jsbm5FFwYf2ArEW36){:target="_blank"}

It was too early, and everyone decided not to go.
#### [Damnoen Saduak Floating Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tKSTmHgaHc4YCbpZ6){:target="_blank"}

I remember it being quite thrilling and adventurous, even though the water was murky and had a smell.
#### Head to Bangkok to stay (2 nights) at [Marriott Queens Park Bangkok](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Bzq2EGFrsxsRTKpj9){:target="_blank"}

#### [HEALTH LAND](https://www.healthlandspa.com/cn/home){:target="_blank"} 2-hour full-body Thai massage

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*qy7YBGcWTMfpItXtapHr9g.jpeg)

The guide specifically told the staff not to step on my back. I remember it being very high-end, but it was painful enough that I couldn't sleep while getting the massage XD.
#### [River City Shopping Complex](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L3Pnv1BpLCpcGs7G7){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7tYE57IoZUXg1gQhWuSa8g.jpeg)

Since we were going on the Chao Phraya Princess cruise + buffet dinner that night, we stopped by the shopping mall near the pier to browse.
#### Chao Phraya Princess Cruise Buffet Dinner

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*EEELplqEfG3bLcGUoLAvRQ.jpeg)

I remember the food being decent, but the main highlight was the beautiful night view, where you could see the lights of the Bangkok [Riverside Night Market Ferris Wheel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/evFHo6ciFY4jswSt9){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6pzhTRcjRh_b6Z4jOJH_fg.jpeg)

After returning to the hotel, we went to the bar on the top floor of the Marriott for a drink. I just remember the night view being beautiful and the drinks being cheap.
### Day 4 Free Day

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*NU2LiyNLR8lgf7phtPYKHg.jpeg)

I only remember going shopping at the mall, Big C, and Central World.
#### In the evening, we went to [Zoom Sky Bar at Anantara Sathorn Bangkok](https://www.kkday.com/zh-hk/product/105589-zoom-sky-bar-anantara-sathorn-bangkok-package?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} for drinks.

### Day 5 Return Trip

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*SpSAMDAk7Pp7SSCrmCyBQQ.jpeg)

That's the memory of the 2018 staff trip. This time, returning to Bangkok for a fully independent trip made me more familiar with the city. Compared to my previous visits, I feel it's more prosperous, the food is better, and prices have increased since then.
