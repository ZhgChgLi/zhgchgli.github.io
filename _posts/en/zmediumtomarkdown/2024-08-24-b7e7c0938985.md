### [Travel Diary] 5-Day Free Trip to Bangkok, Thailand 🇹🇭 2024

Returning to Thailand after the pandemic for a quick five-day trip to Bangkok.

#### Memories of Bangkok

Let’s rewind to 2018, when I took my first job and went on my first company trip abroad to Bangkok, Thailand (5 days). The following year, in 2019, I went on another company trip to Sabah. Then came the two years stolen by the pandemic, after which I went crazy traveling to Japan.

Back then, I was a total newbie with zero social experience, blindly following my older siblings around. I didn’t even know what I could or couldn’t bring on a plane. At security, I clumsily placed my passport in the basket, only to realize it had fallen onto the conveyor belt when I exited the scanner. I was terrified (if it had fallen into a gap, I might not have made it back!). That trip was a mindless group tour, and my impressions of Bangkok were vague. I only remember the amazing rooftop bars, the hot weather, cheap goods, and affordable massages—nothing more, and I had no concept of the geography.

So, I always thought about returning to Bangkok to revisit those memories from six years ago. However, I wasn’t familiar with Southeast Asia and was hesitant to travel alone. **Then, at the beginning of the year, while chatting with colleagues from Pinkoi, we decided to plan this five-day free trip to Bangkok.**

> _I’ve included details and fragments of memories from my 2018 Bangkok + Hua Hin trip in the appendix at the end of this article._

Since I started a new job in June, I didn’t have much time to focus on planning the trip. Mark and Sean took charge of the arrangements, and I didn’t do much research.

#### 19:30 Arrival at Bangkok BKK Suvarnabhumi Airport

I only learned from my colleagues that during peak hours at Bangkok Airport, you can purchase the [**Thailand Airport BKK Departure Meet and Greet Fast Track Service**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/160605?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} for a quick customs clearance XD. However, since we arrived at this time, there were almost only people from our flight, so the customs process was very quick.

#### 20:00 Baggage Claim and Exiting the Airport

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*QDvOtf4PsS-jSESOkb-0AA.jpeg)

Perhaps due to the low-cost airline, there weren't many people checking in luggage, and baggage claim was super fast.

#### eSIM Network Setup

As soon as I exited the airport, I started figuring out how to set up and activate my eSIM, only to find out that...

> **_⚠️ Activating eSIM requires an internet connection ⚠️_** 

It’s a bit like buying a pair of scissors but needing another pair to cut open the packaging; you need to connect to the internet to activate the eSIM. Luckily, a friend traveling with me had already activated his eSIM in Taiwan, so I borrowed his internet to activate mine. (The airport also has Wi-Fi available, so there's no need to worry too much.)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7-7yMcMgwbpNzBq1YgknaQ.png)

To find the eSIM activation option, simply long-press the QR code and select "Add eSIM."

> **_I don't know why, but if you save the QR code to photos or notes, you lose the quick add feature. Another method is to send the QR code to a travel companion or print it out for your phone to scan._**

Manual iPhone iOS eSIM setup path: Settings -> Cellular -> Add eSIM -> Scan QR Code -> Manually enter information -> Use as... You can select "Travel" -> Choose "Travel" for mobile data -> Done!

Once activated, it’s like having dual SIMs. However, the original SIM card won’t have internet unless you purchase a roaming plan. **In case of emergencies, you can switch back to the original SIM card!**
- [To check your AIS mobile number, dial *545#, to check your balance, dial *121#, and for data usage, dial *121*3#](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}

#### 20:30 Finding Food at the Airport

Since it would take over an hour to get to the city and the hotel, and the low-cost airline doesn’t provide meals, everyone was quite hungry, so we decided to grab dinner at the airport.

We found a Thai restaurant where I had some spicy minced pork with basil, which was deliciously spicy, paired with vegetable soup to help ease the heat.

#### 21:00 Moving to the Hotel

After finishing dinner around 21:00, we started moving towards the city and the hotel.

**Taking public transport requires three transfers between the subway and BTS:**
1. Airport Rail Link `Suvarnabhumi` -> `Phaya Thai`

- The Airport Rail Link only allows ticket purchases.
- You can buy a Rabbit Card (BTS transportation card) at the ticket window for top-ups and swipe in and out.
- Please note that the **Rabbit Card can only be used on the BTS**, not on the MRT or Airport Rail Link.

When exiting the BTS, don’t rush down the overpass; you can walk across the road from the overpass.

> **_I felt it was quite dark along the way (not many streetlights), and it was a bit far to walk (15 mins / 1 KM). It could be quite scary to walk alone at night._** _Along the way, I passed a 7-Eleven and a small night market, where I bought some snacks to take back to the hotel._

> _Also, if you take a taxi, due to the two-way road and U-turn issues, the driver has to go past the hotel a bit to the next gap to turn back, which can be a bit of a hassle._

#### 22:30 Arrival at JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL

Arrived at the hotel around 22:30.

The room is very spacious, like a whole apartment, with a master bedroom, a secondary bedroom, two bathrooms, a kitchen, a living room, and a balcony.

What a coincidence! During a group employee trip to Bangkok in 2018, everyone specifically took a taxi to this hotel’s rooftop bar XD.

Additionally, they offer a Sky Bar dinner package:

Since there were many of us, we decided to take a Grab (THB 135) directly to Wat Pho.

On the way, we passed through [Chinatown](https://www.kkday.com/zh-hk/blog/101689/bangkokchinatown?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}, but I forgot to take a photo; it had a very cyberpunk vibe!

You need to take off your shoes to enter, and you can walk around the Reclining Buddha to pay your respects.

#### SuperRich Currency Exchange

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GKVidaEFygfEMNjfKFNweA.jpeg)

After leaving Wat Pho, I thought I’d handle the currency exchange first. Only one friend had exchanged some Thai Baht beforehand; the others planned to exchange in Bangkok. So, we walked to the nearby [The Old Siam Shopping Plaza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UPNxgoTmtswuhHVS8){:target="_blank"} to exchange money at SuperRich.

**⚠️ Please note: The Taiwanese dollars you want to exchange must be free of stains, markings, etc., or they will be rejected. (I happened to have a thousand-dollar bill from an ATM in Taiwan that had a pencil mark on it and was rejected for exchange.)**

> _NTD $5,000 exchanged for THB $5,200_

Khanom bueang Thai Pancake

After exchanging money, we had cash, so we replenished our energy at the food market on the first floor; I had a sweet Thai pancake (ขนมเบื้อง) filled with meringue, which was very sweet and reminiscent of cotton candy, along with a banana pancake; finally, I bought an iced coffee to continue our journey.

#### Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew

Around 13:00, after exiting the Grand Palace, we found a Western restaurant nearby towards the pier to have lunch.

#### 14:00 Preparing to Take the Boat to Wat Arun

> **_⚠️ There will be people outside the pier trying to solicit you, asking where you're going. Be careful as they might be private boat operators, charging high fees (THB 500, 1000) and are not safe; just ignore them and find the official pier and tell the staff where you want to go. ⚠️_**

> **_The official ticket price is only THB 30 (_** _`Tha Chang` **to Wat Arun), and the new boats have air conditioning, making them safe and comfortable._**

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*oc8bbW-4ZZwQeFkqNhXwNw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ccUJ7WKGfb73k8UWEDNesg.jpeg)

When the boat arrives, the staff will announce "Wat Arun" (yes, in Chinese), and you can ask anytime if you're unsure.

The rainstorm is approaching in the afternoon, and you can see the water flowing rapidly and murkily.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8hMHmiUOANTISYOVpTISiA.jpeg)

The boat is quite new, the air conditioning is cool, and it feels very safe in the enclosed space. There are also plenty of departures, making it very convenient!

Upon arrival, the staff will also announce "Wat Arun."

#### 14:30 Arrive at Wat Arun

Ticket price: THB 200

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ujWr_UkXTX__M2jEz06sUw.jpeg)

After disembarking, you can queue directly to buy tickets for Wat Arun.

> **_⚠️ Dress code applies at Wat Arun ⚠️_** 

> **_No bare shoulders, shorts, midriffs, or short skirts._** 

> **_You can wear traditional Thai clothing; many people wear it for photos._**

You can walk to the middle platform for photos (⚠️ the stairs are steep, so be careful). Many people also change into traditional Thai clothing here for memorable pictures.

After visiting, head back to the pier and find the ticket booth (PIER 2) to buy a ticket for the boat to ICONSIAM (THB 40), then go to PIER 1 to board.

Wander towards the BTS Charoen Nakhon station, thinking of getting a foot massage for an hour.

There’s a newer, larger place right outside called (1) THAI GARDEN MASSAGE, but they were fully booked; luckily, I continued walking to (2) another massage shop as shown in the picture. I found it very comfortable, less crowded, spacious, and quieter, with affordable rates (foot massage/1 hour/THB 270).

After the massage, I felt re-energized to continue shopping and returned to ICONSIAM; I walked to the upstairs restaurant, which is quite extravagant, featuring a jungle, small bridges, and waterfalls—overall, it’s really nice!

This line is a branch with only three stations and less frequent service.

> _Google Maps seems to lack information about this BTS line; it suggested I walk to Krung Thon Buri instead._ 

From here, taking one stop to Krung Thon Buri connects to the Silom Line.

The owner seems to be Chinese? It feels like a fusion of Chinese and Thai cuisine, a highly-rated old restaurant that appears to be a favorite of Blackpink's Lisa.

Since I was heading to a pub for live music later, I ate a bit quickly, but I found every dish delicious!
- In the first three pictures, the dish called หมูสับผัดหนำเลี้ยบ, which looks like minced meat with olives, is very tasty with rice!
- In the second picture, the fried oyster omelet is similar to the fried oyster omelet from Taiwan's Shilin Night Market.
- In the second picture, the seasonal drink is longan tea.
- In the second picture, the most special dish is the crab curry (Panang Curry), made with a whole fresh crab.

> _The Thai-recommended dish, the minced meat with olives, I later bought a jar of it; it smells smoother than mint nasal sticks and is less irritating to the nasal cavity!_

I took a Grab to [Wang Chun Sheng Beef Hotpot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1VuwzAdKS4vH6kmj6){:target="_blank"} for breakfast. The overall flavor is quite Chinese/Taiwanese, and I think it’s good, but Tainan beef soup is even better.

Chatuchak Market is large, with dense stalls, but overall it’s clean and easy to navigate. However, many items are repetitive, and it seems a lot of them are touristy Made In China products.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GJv4mk3v2-DptRofTF_9zg.jpeg)

In the end, I only bought a Thai brand, Phutawan indoor diffuser, as a souvenir.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*28EbS8N3OUJwSCPrgaTb8Q.png)

Feeling tired from shopping, I went into a massage shop for a foot and some shoulder and neck massage (1 hour/THB 250).
#### Restroom

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*tGe2u5gIF70mPz3d7sX5XQ.jpeg)

If you need to use the restroom at Chatuchak, there are paid restrooms outside the market (THB 5 per use). I went in, and it was very clean, with one stall per person, and they are generally cleaned regularly. If you don’t want to pay, you can go to the nearby [Mixt Chatuchak](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5PwQcFThBHtFpbzw6){:target="_blank"} mall, which has free and equally clean restrooms.

Seafood rice

For lunch, I casually resolved it at a restaurant inside [Mixt Chatuchak](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5PwQcFThBHtFpbzw6){:target="_blank"}, and the taste was quite good.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*LeJHthehTAM7xdrlOLhETg.jpeg)

After eating, I continued to browse and bought a cup of durian juice, which was rich and authentic in flavor and reasonably priced (THB 89).

> _Later, I found that items at Chatuchak are actually cheaper; for example, the mint nasal sticks here sell for 6 for $99, while Big C sells them for 6 for $140… and the durian juice is also cheaper; it sells for over $140 at night markets in the city._ 

#### 15:00 Take BTS to King Power Mahanakhon

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*A4V3CL5XvLoQ4sp487pJuQ.jpeg)

Chatuchak is closer to the MRT, but we are heading to King Power Mahanakhon, which is at BTS Chong Nonsi station; it takes about 1 KM (15 mins) to walk from Chatuchak to the nearest BTS Saphan Khwai station.
#### King Power Mahanakhon (Bangkok's King Power Mahanakhon)

Ticket price: THB 1,080 per person

> _👉👉👉 [**Recommended to buy tickets in advance from KKday for a better price: Bangkok King Power Mahanakhon SkyWalk tickets (free cancellation 2 days in advance)**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20739-king-power-mahanakhon-sky-walk-bangkok-ticket?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*AJADLZZvKK4E4LXvuDWkYA.png)

Up close, it doesn’t seem as towering as expected, but the architectural style is quite unique, resembling a cyberpunk aesthetic.

Upon entering, you must go through a security check, and after purchasing tickets, you can store your belongings for free; backpacks are not allowed upstairs (small waist bags are fine).

> _Before taking the elevator, you can choose whether to take a photo (the ticket includes a series of free digital photos; if you want physical photos, you have to pay extra)._

![_Free digital photos; after the visit, staff will guide you on how to download them_](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*tyRULc9fnEvUtI-uP6AS1A.jpeg)

_Free digital photos; after the visit, staff will guide you on how to download them._

The direct elevator has a 360-degree scene animation similar to Taipei 101 and the Tokyo Skytree; the height is about comparable to Tokyo Tower.

Here’s the translated text in naturalistic English, while preserving the original markdown image sources:

---

The elevator first takes you to the indoor observation deck on the 74th floor, where there’s a café and some public seating for a quick rest. To reach the outdoor observation deck on the 78th floor, you’ll need to transfer to another elevator or take the stairs.

As soon as you arrive on the 78th floor, there’s a small bar where you can order a drink and enjoy the view.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*PeqjUWSwE1Hh24qWkioTxA.png)

After exiting the 78th floor, you can continue up the stairs to the top-level rest area.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ka4Pl5OQcXwptpdj6JMEPA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*f6oB_qelx6mxJQUDhyJoxQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dFRAU2mY_Qp9T0ru4GngIg.jpeg)

From the top floor, you can enjoy a panoramic view of Bangkok, and you can imagine how beautiful the night view must be!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*f4eREu0dL79OzsYCtl1O9A.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XOsqBu8PjCeB7XSlsD0_Fg.jpeg)

The stairs and the top-level rest area face the famous transparent glass corridor, where you can see straight down to the ground. You can grab shoe covers from a nearby box to enter, but **phones are not allowed inside. You can ask your companions or staff for help with taking photos.**

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*9AVMpOE7sP7aJGdLbXXeFA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*TtjAOAoGcWNI9NtNn4LVAA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*K2MOcxsrNbuNbz00sPfNOg.png)

The entire glass corridor isn’t very large, about the size of a rooftop infinity pool at a hotel. It doesn’t feel very high when viewed from the side, but walking on it can still be a bit nerve-wracking—my legs felt a little weak! XD

### Ratchada Night Market (originally Ratchada Train Night Market)

![You can swipe your credit card at the MRT](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*BrfghHaJknyt6IiX7yOgbA.jpeg)

You can swipe your credit card at the MRT.

To get to Central Rama 9, you need to transfer to the MRT subway at Pharam 9 Station. The Rabbit Card cannot be used here, so you’ll need to buy a ticket or you can now use a VISA card to enter and exit directly.

> _I tested it with the Taishin GoGo card, but I haven’t tried it with the Cathay Cube._

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*TfSOFizTa2e6v08mp0L8DQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*HENvMK0DHVUKjQXlQ9AaLA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*c6Ug9F-JfXPzgnfvtvRvdg.jpeg)

For dinner, we came here to find something to eat. I must say that Bangkok’s night markets and markets are far superior to those in Taiwan. The overall environment is clean, there are seating areas, it’s not chaotic, and it’s well-organized, making it very pleasant to stroll around.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1cBlgC7kvmt1fWeMfiDVMA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OVMfzMU1HugpE0CVyUiSVw.jpeg)

After browsing around, I first tried the dessert on the left (similar to an egg cake?) and the savory seafood grill on the right. Both were chewy and quite good.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*31mIDWp4WgTX8TSK5Q-C4Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*jMuzNnI8CCSLDZj4Tq9jHQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*K3ZN-Kiwz4yTiNHiZ3P1bg.jpeg)

Next up was the highlight: volcanic ribs. The flavor was quite unique, with a lemongrass and spicy sauce. You can just put on gloves and dig in with your hands—it’s very appetizing!

After eating, I also bought coconut ice cream with mango and peanut dessert from another stall, which was delicious!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GamIzqKB9ROnECRfhPfA1Q.jpeg)

Afterward, we strolled around Central Rama 9, where there’s also the famous NaRaYa Bangkok bags.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*a5BcYS64yitoccK9TTU1HQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*csaO0X3lGf2TSIb3xQ8JWg.jpeg)

On the way back to the hotel, we happened to encounter Bangkok after a rain shower, with colorful digital advertising screens creating a vibrant contrast—very cyberpunk!

#### 7-Eleven Hot Pressed Toast for Late Night Snack

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Q_ZcnuANczrDSH2a_UrlpQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*xfDNDCREdA2reWLeSXb1rw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*xQi9q1iA7o6FyfAeEISTEw.jpeg)

On the way back to the hotel, I tried Thailand’s [hot pressed toast from the convenience store](https://supertaste.tvbs.com.tw/pack/347495){:target="_blank"} along with Thai banana milk. The filling was melted cheese with a hot dog, and the crust was flaky! It was really delicious and cheap!

### 8/05 Day 4 Central World, Big C, Terminal 21

> **_Didn’t sleep well all night + hungover all day, feeling a bit dazed._**

#### Central World

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8pZ3crfkb4wIqZZOoI9-zA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6_evilQk4T0LdCYSIgBudg.jpeg)

In the morning, I headed out to shop at Central World.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Sp3TTqnEx3yn6IM4H38NsQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*tmLvijY5Q7TVJbMo4D4XFg.jpeg)

On the first floor, there’s a SHAKE SHACK burger place. I tried the signature SHAKE SHACK burger and a coconut milkshake that’s exclusive to Bangkok. The burger was tasty and not greasy, but I found the milkshake a bit too sweet.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OXOp4dN-5p9xS1ojcu0b9A.jpeg)

The place is quite large, and like ICONSIAM, if you want to explore thoroughly, you won’t finish in one visit… I just did a quick browse and bought a shirt.

#### Big C

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*JNswfx_h01UuffS299HjgQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GWD-HcYbLfAQEAN99tErsw.jpeg)

After shopping at Central World, I walked across to Big C to buy snacks and souvenirs. (There are many options, but I didn’t find them much cheaper…)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Bda3BGHI_ZeylIS96UNcWg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*DWtvvjZ3iAwk5U3MPZDudg.jpeg)

![Bottom left: Phutawan indoor diffuser was bought yesterday at Chatuchak, but I guess you can find it in department stores in the city too.](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*aMillKlyevVx8fDncaurSA.png)

The indoor diffuser from Phutawan was bought yesterday at Chatuchak, but I guess you can find it in department stores in the city too.

Also, it seems that Big C no longer provides plastic bags, so you have to buy an eco-bag in the store.

> _That big bag of dried durian actually only contains two small bags… but it’s quite tasty._

#### Lunch

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*z4VW1WOelH7UjBco9PIAqg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*JsLSSg1m40v8aWJCmGkwzQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*qWWrZXa_LRClqCTi7bZK3Q.png)

There was a food market event in the outdoor plaza of Central World. It’s not just a simple setup with tents; it has a theme, and this time it was Titanic. You can enter for free by following their official YouTube channel; the decorations inside were also quite exquisite.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*9iurlEySgDL-ZQZzVGDiug.jpeg)

But for lunch, we ended up eating at SHAKE SHACK again, this time trying the chicken thigh burger, which was just as delicious.

#### Afternoon: Returned to the hotel for a nap because I didn’t sleep well and was hungover… I was really exhausted.

#### Dinner at Terminal 21

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8_lDD7yaIYIq7HV4zG4ClA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1T7njk_JYMi1eP1oMbjH-w.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*giNbQ1GPda-qPFaA8yQ7sQ.jpeg)

Terminal 21 is also a place you can’t finish exploring in one visit. Each floor has a different regional theme; for example, the Japan floor mainly sells Japanese products and restaurants.

I mainly met up with [Chun-Hsiu Liu](https://medium.com/u/72361fccaa43){:target="_blank"} at the food court upstairs for a meal. ( **A cheap and delicious dining spot that I highly recommend!** )

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ZyuBXqyjZtLw5zyVmarw6w.png)

At the food court, you find your own seat, and many locals come here to eat as well.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*a4MnqcM5Bi9jRPC3T29s5A.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*sYc87mPtI1nf3-9pk_F13w.png)

> _⚠️ **The payment method here is that the vendors don’t directly take money. You need to go to the counter to exchange cash for a food card, and then use the QR code on the food card to pay. After eating, return to the counter to return the card for a refund. (No deposit or service fee required.)**_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*rt81B-Pc31OZeMlgG5M38Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*k1vmadbwhdJsJNmkllarLQ.jpeg)

There are many options to choose from; just line up, tell them your number, and use the food card QR code to pay. You can also take it to go (I remember there’s an extra THB 10 packaging fee).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Ol8uiQNEnE9tuZc-qbgqgQ.jpeg)

I ordered seafood fried noodles (THB 50) + pork chop with fries (THB 59) = THB 109.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t2R762mSI8CeoDWpSAuEKg.jpeg)

After eating, I also took a box of mango sticky rice to enjoy as a late-night snack back at the hotel.

It’s really delicious and cheap! A meal at a restaurant outside usually starts at THB 200–300, while here, most meals are around THB 50–80.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*G4G79vwVWj592tOApWbK2g.jpeg)

After eating, I went to the back to stroll around [Benjakitti Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bmKhQpbw9KTtLYeN8){:target="_blank"} and look for the legendary [Bangkok monitor lizard](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%B7%A8%E8%9C%A5%E4%BD%94%E9%A0%98%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8-%E8%A2%AB%E5%B0%81%E6%B3%B0%E7%89%88%E4%BE%8F%E7%BE%8E%E5%85%AC%E5%9C%92-104942584.html){:target="_blank"}; perhaps because it was nighttime, I didn’t see a single one.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dMZhzj3rAqhRWAVuxeS0XQ.jpeg)

Back at the hotel, my travel companion had bought some mangosteen to try. I found the fresh ones delicious, with a light sweetness and the flavor of the mangosteen, making it very pleasant. Later, I tried dried mangosteen, but it wasn’t as good—just dry and sour.

> **_As for durians, the prices in Bangkok aren’t any cheaper… a whole one is still THB 200–300._**

### 8/06 Day 5 Return Trip
#### Bangkok Monitor Lizard

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6oX4YygURRzsrDmv_OAJ2Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*E0M71hXTtQmzl2YP6kgPtw.jpeg)

In the morning, I was determined and went to [Lumphini Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n53FhsjXUUJLnghn6){:target="_blank"} to find the legendary Bangkok monitor lizard. Due to time constraints, I only found one medium-sized lizard that had just come out to sunbathe.

> _Looking for the monitor lizard was just a personal whim of mine. It’s said that locals really dislike these lizards (water monitor lizards) because they eat dirty things, so it’s best not to touch them._

#### 12:00 Back to the hotel to grab luggage and head to the airport

My flight is at 15:20, so I need to leave by noon. It takes about an hour to get from the city to the airport.

> _👉👉👉 You can refer to KKday for airport transfer services:_

The Grab fare from the hotel was THB 577, and we had to take the highway. The driver paid the toll in advance, and the final Grab charge will include the toll fee (I think it was around THB 50).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ENH0G1_tBNWy-8RHV9XCag.jpeg)

I was only allowed to check in 15 kg, and I managed to keep it under control.

After going through immigration, it was around 13:20. The security checks at Bangkok airport are quite strict; everything has to go through security, and almost all carry-on luggage needs to be opened for manual inspection.

Feel free to ask if you need any further modifications or additional translations!

After going through immigration and security, I had about an hour to grab a bite to eat, so I found a Thai restaurant for my last meal in Thailand. I had seafood fried rice, mango juice, and mango sticky rice.

> _Many shops sell mango sticky rice in takeout boxes after you exit, so if you don't have enough, you can buy some to eat on the plane!_

> _**(⚠️ But remember, it's prohibited to bring it back to Taiwan ⚠️)**_

I have to give this bottle of water a close-up because the budget airline doesn't provide anything, and I thought I could buy water at the airport. However, after passing through immigration, a bottle of mineral water costs THB 70 — 100, and this one was THB 100.

BKK is huge... filled with Trip.com advertisements. My return flight was on time, so I took the shuttle bus to the terminal.
#### Back in Taiwan

I arrived at TPE Taoyuan International Airport, collected my luggage, and headed straight to catch the `1841` or `1819` Kuo-Kuang bus back to Taipei. It was very convenient without needing to transfer.

### ⚠️ Safety Tips and Precautions for Traveling in Bangkok ⚠️

The most important thing when going out is safety, so I've compiled some safety tips and precautions here.
#### Scam Prevention

[![Common scams in Thailand that travelers often fall for](/assets/b7e7c0938985/07b5_hqdefault.jpg "Common scams in Thailand that travelers often fall for")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o42r-bg16Fg){:target="_blank"}

The following points are summarized from a video by a Bangkok travel expert. I personally encountered a currency exchange scam during this trip.
1. Incorrect calculations
   It may not always be intentional; you can calculate the total amount when ordering.
2. Someone approaches you asking to see your country's currency or if you want to exchange money
   When you pull out your wallet, they may steal or snatch it.
3. Outside the Grand Palace or other attractions, someone may falsely claim the site is closed and enthusiastically suggest taking a tuk-tuk to other places (like black temples or shops, **I encountered this at the pier**).
4. Tuk-tuks may have inflated prices or suddenly increase the fare halfway through the ride.
   If you want to experience a tuk-tuk but are worried about being overcharged, [try the new MUVMI app for tuk-tuk rides](https://bkk.com.tw/muvmi-app/){:target="_blank"}.
   Even with seemingly reputable tuk-tuks, be cautious of scam #3, where they enthusiastically suggest visiting attractions or taking a boat ride.
5. Fake staff may try to lure you into their restaurant while you're waiting in line, speaking your language to explain the menu and then asking for payment upfront before disappearing with your money.
6. Motorcycle rental scams
   Never leave your passport as a deposit. If you encounter malicious claims of damage, it can become problematic.
   Opt for larger, reputable rental companies, and always record the vehicle's condition before renting.
7. Dating app scams
   You might end up meeting a ladyboy, a scammer, or worse.
8. The Patpong ping pong show scam, where enthusiastic touts ask if you want to see a ping pong show, claiming you only need to buy a drink for THB 100, then take you into a dark alley or a shady establishment.
   It's hard to leave, and when you do, they might demand THB 3,000, claiming the THB 100 deal doesn't exist.
9. Be cautious of pickpockets in crowded places, even in areas where you need to buy tickets to enter (e.g., the Grand Palace, Wat Pho).

#### 🌿🚬

Next year, it will be banned, but I can share some experiences.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️ Edibles (like gummies) can be very potent, and the scary part is that they feel just like regular gummies when you eat them. They can hit you suddenly a few hours later ⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- It's best to try them gradually: eat 1/3, wait a few hours, if nothing happens, eat 2/3, wait a few hours, feel a little something, then try one whole piece...
- For smoking, it's also best to start gradually based on your tolerance.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️ It's strongly recommended to try these in your hotel. If you feel out of it, you can rest right away, which is safer ⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- Just because you drink doesn't mean you have a higher tolerance.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️** Your heart rate may increase, which can be uncomfortable **⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- It's safer to have someone sober around to take care of you if needed.
- Smoking should only be done in specific situations.

#### Other Tips
- Thailand is not a tipping culture, so generally, you don't need to tip; I only give THB 20 as a small gesture for massages.
- Alcohol can only be sold from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM and from 5:00 PM to midnight. It's prohibited all day on Buddhist holidays.
- Not all hotel balconies allow smoking, so be sure to ask.
- The emergency hotline for foreigners is `1155`.
- SuperRich has specific business hours, so if you arrive too early or too late, you won't be able to exchange money.

### Day 1
#### [Moai Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/URymiZfGGrM8KFmY7){:target="_blank"} (Closed)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*gINRuaBCC2a3HB41dJVUng.jpeg)

A colleague (2024) mentioned that Bangkok has many trendy cafes that are quite extravagant. If you're interested, you can look them up, but this one had low ratings and is now closed.
#### Dinner — [Chom View Seafood](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LVVRnpUEfozXxAfM6){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*_tX6g2M0pNmUz7HTEBAEWw.jpeg)

I didn't take many photos of the hotel, just one of a big cockroach I found in my blanket when I woke up in the morning.
### Day 2
#### [Santorini Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5e56XAK4en27bHbPA){:target="_blank"} (Closed)

[**Santorini Park: A Little Greece in Thailand | BringYou**](https://www.bring-you.info/zh-tw/santorini-park){:target="_blank"} 
[_Located in the Seven Rocks area on the way from Bangkok to Hua Hin, Santorini Park is a popular weekend destination for Thai families. If you love taking photos, I highly recommend visiting this incredibly romantic park._](https://www.bring-you.info/zh-tw/santorini-park){:target="_blank"}

It seemed like a small amusement park with Greek-style scenery and a shopping mall.
#### [Hua Hin Artist Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UcF7Wd82aHq4aGP86){:target="_blank"}

A well-known attraction that is still open in 2024.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*qg-pxwX-f19ABBjHR9phOQ.jpeg)

There are many paintings and artworks.
#### Back to Sheraton to enjoy the facilities and beach

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*448HsB-gg4LjZx0qBo-Fkw.jpeg)

The hotel is in a villa style, with each room being a standalone unit. The swimming pool surrounds every room, and there's a bar by the pool. The beach outside is undeveloped and quite barren.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*miAu_2XD5vl5BIJVlBVtHw.jpeg)

After dinner, we went to a nearby night market.
### Day 3
#### [Maeklong Railway Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Jsbm5FFwYf2ArEW36){:target="_blank"}

It was too early, so everyone decided not to go.
#### [Damnoen Saduak Floating Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tKSTmHgaHc4YCbpZ6){:target="_blank"}

> 👉👉👉 **_These two attractions are not very accessible; you can refer to KKday for tours:_**

I remember it being quite thrilling and adventurous, even though the water was murky and had a smell.
#### Head to Bangkok to check into the (2-day) [Marriott Queens Park Bangkok](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Bzq2EGFrsxsRTKpj9){:target="_blank"}

#### [HEALTH LAND](https://www.healthlandspa.com/cn/home){:target="_blank"} for a 2-hour full-body Thai massage

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*qy7YBGcWTMfpItXtapHr9g.jpeg)

The guide specifically told the staff not to step on my back. I remember it being quite luxurious, but it was painful enough that I couldn't sleep! XD
#### [River City Shopping Complex](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L3Pnv1BpLCpcGs7G7){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7tYE57IoZUXg1gQhWuSa8g.jpeg)

Since we were going on the Chao Phraya Princess cruise with a buffet dinner that night, we stopped by a shopping mall near the pier to browse.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*EEELplqEfG3bLcGUoLAvRQ.jpeg)

I remember the food being decent, but the main highlight was the beautiful night view, where you could see the lights of the [Asiatique Ferris Wheel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/evFHo6ciFY4jswSt9){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*5LGuEF_icqEUwOCb649QVw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6pzhTRcjRh_b6Z4jOJH_fg.jpeg)

After returning to the hotel, we went to the bar on the Marriott rooftop for a drink. I remember the night view being beautiful and the drinks being affordable.
### Day 4 Free Day

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*NU2LiyNLR8lgf7phtPYKHg.jpeg)

I remember going shopping at department stores, Big C, and Central World.
#### In the evening, we went to [Zoom Sky Bar at Anantara Sathorn Bangkok](https://www.kkday.com/zh-hk/product/105589-zoom-sky-bar-anantara-sathorn-bangkok-package?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} for drinks.

### Day 5 Return Trip

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*SpSAMDAk7Pp7SSCrmCyBQQ.jpeg)

That wraps up my memories from the 2018 staff trip. This time, returning to Bangkok on a fully independent trip helped me become more familiar with the city. Compared to my previous visits, I feel it's more prosperous, the food is better, and prices have increased since then.
