### \[Travel Diary\] 2024 Bangkok, Thailand 🇹🇭 5-Day Free Trip

Returning to Thailand after the pandemic for a quick five-day trip to Bangkok.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*kRZZjY_7_6WaKRkw9E74iw.jpeg)

#### Memories of Bangkok

Let’s rewind to 2018, when I took my first job and went on my first company trip abroad to Bangkok, Thailand (5 days); the following year, in 2019, I joined another company trip to Sabah. Then came the two years stolen by the pandemic, and after it ended, I went crazy with trips to Japan.

Back then, I was a complete novice with zero social experience, blindly following my older siblings around. I didn’t even know what I could or couldn’t bring on a plane. At security, I clumsily placed my passport in the basket, only to realize it had fallen onto the conveyor belt when I exited the machine. I was nearly scared to death (if it had fallen into a gap, I might not have come back!). That trip was a mindless group tour, and my impressions of Bangkok were vague; I only remembered the amazing rooftop bars, the hot weather, cheap goods, and affordable massages—nothing more, and I had no concept of geography.

So, I always thought about returning to Bangkok to relive those memories from six years ago. However, I wasn’t very familiar with Southeast Asia and didn’t dare to travel alone. **Then, at the beginning of the year, while chatting with colleagues from Pinkoi, we decided to organize this five-day free trip to Bangkok.**

> _I’ve included the details and fragments of memories from the 2018 Bangkok + Hua Hin trip in the appendix at the end of this article._

Since I started a new job in June, I didn’t have much time to focus on fun, so Mark and Sean took charge of the planning, and I didn’t do much research.

> **_⚠️⚠️⚠️ I’ve included safety tips and important notes for traveling in Bangkok at the end of the diary. You can skip the diary but make sure to understand the scams and precautions, especially if you’re considering trying marijuana._**

#### Internet

This time, the preparation was rushed, and I didn’t have time to get my usual physical SIM card. Fortunately, I tried eSIM for the first time. (I fell in love with it!)

I bought the [**Thailand SIM Card | AIS 5G High-Speed Internet 8 Days Unlimited Data + Calls eSIM**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} directly from KKday, and after purchasing, I received the eSIM activation certificate immediately, so I could use it right away.

[Thailand SIM Card | AIS 5G High-Speed Internet 8 Days Unlimited Data + Calls eSIM](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}
- Limited-time promotional offer: From now until December 31, 2024, activating during the promotional period allows you to enjoy high-speed data of 15GB doubled to 30GB. After exceeding 30GB, the speed will drop to 384 Kbps, but you will remain connected.
- Unlimited calls within AIS network, and a 50 THB call credit. When using the following apps for text messaging, you can use an additional 10GB of data (10Mbps): TikTok, WeChat, and Instagram.
- **It comes with a physical number, allowing calls and SMS!**
- Days are calculated in a 24-hour format, starting from the activation of the eSIM, with 24 hours counting as one day (Thailand time).

[It's mainly unlimited data, cheaper than a physical SIM card, 8 days for NT $232.](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}
#### Flight 🛫
- Outbound: TPE 16:00 -> BKK 18:45
- Return: BKK 15:20 -> TPE 20:10

Airline: Thai VietJet Air (low-cost airline)

Price: `TWD $9,259` (including an additional **15 kg** checked luggage)

Initially, I thought it would be better to travel with everyone, and my friends didn’t check in luggage (their ticket price was around `$6,000`). Later, I checked other airlines and felt I missed out; other airlines had similar prices around `$10,000`, not much difference, but much more comfortable!

Thai VietJet Air's luggage policy actually allows you not to check in luggage; you can carry two pieces of hand luggage, with a total weight not exceeding 7 kg.
```
1. Hand luggage weight:
Each passenger (excluding infants) can bring 1 piece of their own luggage and 1 small hand luggage, with a maximum total weight not exceeding 7 kg.

2. Hand luggage dimensions:
- 01 piece with maximum dimensions of 56cm x 36cm x 23cm
- 01 small hand luggage (including the following bags)
  + 01 bag for girls, magazines, cameras, baby food bags, or any bag purchased at the airport not exceeding 30cm x 20cm x 10cm.
  + 01 bag for outerwear, not exceeding 114cm x 60cm x 11cm when opened.
  + 01 bag for a laptop with maximum dimensions of 40cm x 30cm x 10cm.
```

> [_Information as of 2024/08/22, everything is subject to the latest official announcements._](https://www.vietjetair.com/zh-TW/pages/%E8%A1%8C%E6%9D%8E%E8%A6%8F%E5%AE%9A-1607068164219){:target="_blank"} 

Basically, just a backpack and a carry-on suitcase will suffice.
#### Flight Change Notification on 8/1

### 8/02 Day 1 Departure
#### Departing from home around 12:30 PM

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*YsFObRlulrMFKHySvo3NAw.jpeg)

> _Remember to take the direct train to the airport; the regular train, even if it’s early, won’t get you there faster than the direct train!_ 

#### Arriving at Taoyuan Airport Terminal 1 around 13:30

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*BBE4RhKU9tcJI427_LoQMw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ksagRFmStL9nLBWIyYY3Jg.png)

There was no one at the check-in counter, so I went straight to check in and completed the baggage drop-off.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GI5u8vhrNRbFdG-XqY_2LQ.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*CBOJ0KHI4dMmAP5REh1UaA.jpeg)

Again, it was B1R, the farthest corner with a shuttle bus to the boarding gate.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XMQJOe1n5vyVdWQrYJpgNg.png)

With plenty of time before the 4 PM flight, I went to eat at the top-rated Ding Tai Fung again. This time I discovered that I could order just the dumplings, which used to only be available with fried chicken!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*hfpWAbwiM2Aal3MZJ36oOA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XNjYtycibxeowQBaDT_jNw.jpeg)

I also found out that if you walk straight from Ding Tai Fung, you can reach Terminal 2, so if you have time, you can go there to eat; or you can go from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1 for the free VIP lounge! XD

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t4dk8GQIv0D53N0V_qo7KA.png)

After buying Ding Tai Fung, I went to the free VIP lounge in Terminal 1 to relax and eat. This time I saw someone charging their devices; [last time, all the outlets were taken, but it seems they’ve been fixed](../cb65fd5ab770/) (?). 
#### Around 15:30, heading to B1R boarding room

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*2Ros8CQBKj0-kkMugSZ7Hg.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*At7elbjIueB9lvvenvlfTA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*fpzrwzWez_HwgKFuFmDAhA.png)

I’m not sure if it’s because it’s a low-cost airline, but the information wasn’t updated (it kept showing 16:00, but it had actually changed to 16:35).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*puKndBRQgCKs3LKbXbzEWw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*zCT2uidCELNc7WL1NpW72Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1aGwmjed9srQtHli3uDoxg.jpeg)

With the flight delayed, the actual departure time was 17:13.
- VietJet seats are about the same size as Tigerair, larger than Peach Aviation, but the seats are uncomfortable; the leather material isn’t breathable, and sitting for too long can be painful.
- VietJet seems to allow you to bring your own food; on the return flight, someone was eating mango sticky rice without any issues.

#### 19:30 Arrival at Bangkok BKK Suvarnabhumi Airport

I only learned from my colleagues that during peak hours at Bangkok Airport, you can purchase [**Thailand Airport BKK Departure Meet and Greet Fast Track Service**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/160605?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} for a quick pass through immigration XD. However, since we arrived at this time, there were hardly any other passengers besides those on our flight, so the immigration process was very quick.

#### 20:00 Baggage Claim and Exiting the Airport

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*QDvOtf4PsS-jSESOkb-0AA.jpeg)

Perhaps due to the low-cost airline, there weren't many people checking in, and we got our luggage super fast.

#### eSIM Network Setup

As soon as I exited the airport, I started figuring out how to set up and activate my eSIM, only to realize...

> **_⚠️ Activating eSIM requires an internet connection ⚠️_** 

> **_⚠️ Activating eSIM requires an internet connection ⚠️_** 

> **_⚠️ Activating eSIM requires an internet connection ⚠️_** 

It's a bit like buying a pair of scissors but needing another pair to cut the packaging open; you need to connect to the internet to activate the eSIM. Luckily, a friend traveling with me had already activated his eSIM in Taiwan, so I borrowed his internet to activate mine. (The airport also has Wi-Fi available, so there's no need to worry too much.)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*_xv7JB_yl7d47ljrUTpYdw.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6vg_zfmf6tr3SIBUj6gi4A.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7-7yMcMgwbpNzBq1YgknaQ.png)

Once I found the eSIM activation option, I just had to long-press the QR code and select "Add eSIM."

> **_I don't know why, but if you save the QR code to photos or notes, you lose the quick add feature. Another method is to send the QR code to a travel companion or print it out for your phone to scan._** 

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*hZBZoEJCLuHxEgbOVMEXBw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*_MctPE8uZYOdX5vnYoJnvg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*KMKLtNg2Aaeug_cn5fitNQ.jpeg)

Manual setup path for iPhone iOS eSIM: Settings -> Cellular -> Add eSIM -> Scan QR Code -> Manually enter information -> Use as... You can select "Travel" -> Choose "Travel" for mobile data -> Done!

Once activated, it’s like having dual SIMs, but the original SIM card doesn’t have internet until you purchase a roaming plan. **In case of emergencies, you can switch back to the original SIM card!**
- [To check your mobile number, dial *545#, to check your balance, dial *121#, and for data usage, dial *121*3#](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}

#### 20:30 Finding Food at the Airport

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*mDPRItCdp28u5P6tTQelqQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*bgHNI9p20Jyf3t3IMDExMQ.jpeg)

Since it would take over an hour to get to the city and hotel, and the low-cost airline doesn’t provide meals, everyone was quite hungry, so we decided to grab dinner at the airport.

We found a Thai restaurant and had some spicy stir-fried minced pork, which was deliciously spicy, paired with vegetable soup to ease the heat.

#### 21:00 Moving to the Hotel

> _👉👉👉 You can refer to KKday's airport transfer service:_ 

> _[\- Thailand | Airport Private Transfer | Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) / Don Mueang Airport (DMK) — Bangkok/Pattaya/Hua Hin City Hotels](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/3431-bkk-or-dmk-bangkok-private-transfer?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*cagHOMc-TKS9fmhN18zVOQ.png)

After eating, around 21:00, we started moving towards the city and the hotel.

**Taking public transport requires three transfers on the subway and BTS:**
1. Airport Rail Link `Suvarnabhumi` -> `Phaya Thai`
2. BTS Sukhumvit Line `Phaya Thai` -> `Siam`
3. BTS Silom Line `Siam` -> `Chong Nonsi`

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OvL8K9OxwjMCVJ-3hYy2bw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*-eJ_rrYns2teWCITXTnhTA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*PeWlfQ6fd55mU1Ojk0isJQ.png)

- The Airport Rail Link only allows ticket purchases.
- You can buy a Rabbit Card (BTS transportation card) at the ticket window for top-ups and tap in and out.
- Please note that the **Rabbit Card can only be used on the BTS**, not on the MRT or Airport Rail Link.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*EF3IK_FXS4n3igDOsJ0C4A.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*jY4Jg6_vGhAM5CjPrVM-Iw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Dom8OdbMSRAAXtFpykCTZQ.png)

- Arrived at `Chong Nonsi` (later I found out that the King Power MahaNakhon building is at this station!)

#### Walking to [JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL](https://jckevin.com/){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6VrvZBTlo2gjg_lY7oQG8w.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*cgv3HGHsAkH8WL_jA6qTsg.jpeg)

When exiting the BTS, don’t rush down the overpass; you can walk across the road from the overpass.

> **_I felt it was quite dark along the way (not many streetlights), and it was a bit far to walk (15 mins / 1 KM). If you’re walking alone at night, it can be quite scary._** _Along the way, I passed a 7-Eleven and a small night market, where I bought some snacks to take back to the hotel._ 

> _Also, if you take a taxi, due to the two-way road and U-turn issues, the driver has to go past the hotel a bit to the next gap to turn around, which can be a bit troublesome._ 

#### 10:30 Arrival at JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL

I arrived at the hotel around 10:30.

[![JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL](/assets/b7e7c0938985/43d8_hqdefault.jpg "JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg24V_VS6oA){:target="_blank"}

The room is very spacious, like a whole apartment, with a master bedroom, a second bedroom, two bathrooms, a kitchen, a living room, and a balcony.

#### Memories from 2018

What a coincidence! During a group employee trip to Bangkok in 2018, everyone took a taxi to the rooftop bar at this hotel XD.

Additionally, they offer a Sky Bar dinner package:

#### 2024

Since I’m staying here, after dropping off my luggage in the room, I went up to take a look.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*h8ksUQqToXHPTda_RnwkSg.jpeg)

Since it was already past dinner time, I could only order some snacks and skewers.

### 8/03 Day 2 Wat Pho, Grand Palace, Wat Phra Kaew, Wat Arun, ICONSIAM, Lhao Lhao, Rock Pub Live

#### Hotel Breakfast

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t1xva8yggECe94znx32pew.jpeg)

After having breakfast at the hotel, I headed out. I thought the breakfast was okay, but there weren’t many options.

#### 9:30 Departure

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*A2zezLiqIEOngnuebgxUjA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dZQvSlCNcBjgE4-mdnFZMQ.jpeg)

Since there were many of us, we took a Grab (THB 135) directly to Wat Pho.

On the way, we passed through [Chinatown](https://www.kkday.com/zh-hk/blog/101689/bangkokchinatown?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}, but I forgot to take photos; it had a very cyberpunk vibe!

You need to take off your shoes to enter, and you can walk around the Reclining Buddha to pay your respects.

#### SuperRich Currency Exchange

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GKVidaEFygfEMNjfKFNweA.jpeg)

After leaving Wat Pho, I thought I’d tackle the currency exchange issue first. Only one friend had exchanged some Thai Baht in advance; the others planned to exchange in Bangkok. So, we walked to the nearby [The Old Siam Shopping Plaza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UPNxgoTmtswuhHVS8){:target="_blank"} to exchange money at SuperRich.

**⚠️ Please note: The Taiwanese dollars you want to exchange must be free of stains, markings, etc., or they will be rejected. (I happened to have a thousand-dollar bill from an ATM in Taiwan that had a pencil mark on it and was rejected for exchange.)**

> _NTD $5,000 exchanged for THB $5,200_

Khanom bueang Thai pancakes

After exchanging money, I had cash, so I replenished my energy at the food market on the first floor; I had sweet Thai pancakes (ขนมเบื้อง) filled with meringue, which tasted very sweet like cotton candy, and also had banana pancakes; finally, I bought an iced coffee to continue on my way.

#### Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew

Entrance fee: THB 500/person.

Walking back to the Grand Palace (Wat Phra Kaew is inside the Grand Palace), there are many government buildings along the way.

Grand Palace

#### 13:20 Lunch

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*NVu8tXAG7D3sGNRQi-PHGw.jpeg)

Around 13:00, after exiting the Grand Palace, we found a Western restaurant nearby towards the pier to have lunch.

#### 14:00 Preparing to Take the Boat to Wat Arun

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ePMFJ1jf5orPQRQTEJHMnQ.jpeg)

> **_⚠️ There will be people outside the pier trying to solicit you; be careful as they may be private boat operators charging high fees (THB 500, 1000) and may not be safe. Just ignore them and find the official pier and tell the staff where you want to go. ⚠️_** 

> **_The official ticket price is only THB 30 (_** _`Tha Chang` **to Wat Arun), and the new boats have air conditioning, are safe, and comfortable._** 

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*oc8bbW-4ZZwQeFkqNhXwNw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ccUJ7WKGfb73k8UWEDNesg.jpeg)

When the boat arrives, the staff will announce "Wat Arun" (yes, in Chinese), and you can always ask if you're unsure.

The storm is approaching in the afternoon, and you can see the water flowing muddy and swift.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8hMHmiUOANTISYOVpTISiA.jpeg)

The boat is new, the air conditioning is cool, and it feels very safe in the enclosed space. There are also quite a few departures, making it very convenient!

When you arrive, the staff will also announce "Wat Arun."

#### 14:30 Arrive at Wat Arun

Ticket price: THB 200

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ujWr_UkXTX__M2jEz06sUw.jpeg)

After disembarking, you will find yourself at Wat Arun, where you can line up to buy tickets for entry.

> **_⚠️ Dress code at Wat Arun ⚠️_** 

> **_No bare shoulders, shorts, midriffs, or short skirts._** 

> **_You can wear traditional Thai clothing; many people wear it for photos._**

You can walk to the middle platform for photos (⚠️ be careful, the stairs are steep), and many people also change into traditional Thai clothing to take pictures here.

After visiting, head back to the pier and find the ticket booth (PIER 2) to buy a ticket to ICONSIAM (THB 40), then proceed to PIER 1 to board.

It's also a comfortable and safe new boat!
#### 15:00 ICONSIAM

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*MbiMV91xnwXQqSTg4UUx1g.jpeg)

ICONSIAM is huge and looks very luxurious, with a unique food court on the first floor.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*fuuOJMUI4D8F0zPOEH1geg.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*eLZgR_Wmmnt0oWkwO-d-KQ.jpeg)

I bought a cup of ChaTraMue hand-brewed Thai milk tea to recharge.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*P-p65azTMpWowyRbZuyxhQ.png)

I wandered towards the BTS Charoen Nakhon station, thinking of getting a foot massage for an hour.

There was a newer, larger place (1) THAI GARDEN MASSAGE outside the station, but they were fully booked; fortunately, I continued walking to (2) another massage shop, as shown in the picture. I found it very comfortable, less crowded, spacious, and quieter, with a cheap rate (foot massage/1 hour/THB 270).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*s6--mVkXnO3wqrcTHRgL0Q.png)

After the massage, I had the energy to continue shopping, returning to ICONSIAM; I walked to an upstairs restaurant, which was also quite extravagant, featuring a jungle, small bridges, and waterfalls—overall, it was very nice!

> _I bought the famous Japanese fries, TORO FRIES (the line was long) to recharge._ 

> _They also have % coffee from Japan here._ 

#### Heading to LHAO LHAO for dinner

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*FkVlLZzqOg0Q3j30Jvvppg.png)

This line is a branch with only three stations and less frequent service.

> _Google Maps seems to lack information about this BTS line; it suggested I walk to Krung Thon Buri._ 

From here, taking one stop to Krung Thon Buri connects to the Silom Line.

At Siam, I switched to the Sukhumvit Line and got off at Ari station, which is just a short walk to LHAO LHAO restaurant.
#### 19:00 [LHAO LHAO](https://bkk.com.tw/2012-12-12-186/#LHAO_LHAO_%E7%A8%80%E9%A3%AF%EF%BC%88%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%95%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%95%E0%B9%8A%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B8%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%87%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B2%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B2%EF%BC%89){:target="_blank"}

The owner seems to be Chinese? It feels like a fusion of Chinese and Thai cuisine, a highly-rated old restaurant, and apparently a favorite of Blackpink's Lisa.

Since I had to go to a pub for live music later, I ate quickly, but I found every dish delicious!!
- In the first three pictures, the dish with the background of the "Goose Brand Cooling Balm," called หมูสับผัดหนำเลี้ยบ, seems to be stir-fried minced pork with olive vegetables? It goes well with rice!
- In the second picture, the fried oyster omelet, similar to the fried oyster omelet from Shilin Night Market in Taiwan.
- In the second picture, the seasonal drink, longan tea.
- In the second picture, the most special dish, crab curry (Panang Curry), made with a whole fresh crab.

> _The Goose Brand Cooling Balm recommended by Thais; I later bought a jar that smells smoother than a menthol stick and is less irritating to the nasal passages!_ 

#### 20:00 [The Rock Pub](https://www.instagram.com/therockpub/){:target="_blank"}

Four performances, all rock and classic old songs!

I recognized songs from: Coldplay, Radiohead, Kings of Leon, Arcade Fire, Oasis, The Killers…

I took a Grab to [Wang Chun Sheng Beef Hot Pot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1VuwzAdKS4vH6kmj6){:target="_blank"} for breakfast. The overall flavor is quite Chinese/Taiwanese, and I think it's good, but Tainan beef soup is even better.

> _After eating, I headed to Chatuchak Market, which is a bit far, so I didn't want to walk and transfer to BTS; I took an Uber instead (THB 374)._

Chatuchak is large, with dense stalls, but overall it's clean and easy to navigate. However, many items are repetitive, and it seems like a lot of them are touristy Made In China products.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GJv4mk3v2-DptRofTF_9zg.jpeg)

In the end, I only bought a Thai brand, Phutawan indoor diffuser, as a souvenir.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*28EbS8N3OUJwSCPrgaTb8Q.png)

Feeling tired from shopping, I went into a massage shop for a foot and some shoulder and neck massage (1 hour/THB 250).
#### Restroom

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*tGe2u5gIF70mPz3d7sX5XQ.jpeg)

If you need to use the restroom at Chatuchak, there are paid restrooms outside the market (THB 5 per use). I went in, and it was very clean, with one stall per person, and they are generally cleaned regularly. If you don't want to pay, you can go to the nearby [Mixt Chatuchak](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5PwQcFThBHtFpbzw6){:target="_blank"} mall, which has free and equally clean restrooms.

After eating, I continued to shop and bought a cup of durian juice, which was rich and authentic in flavor and reasonably priced (THB 89).

> _Later, I found that things at Chatuchak are actually cheaper; for example, the menthol sticks were sold here for 6 for $99, while Big C sold them for 6 for $140… and the durian juice too, which was over $140 at night markets in the city._ 

#### 15:00 Take BTS to King Power Mahanakhon

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*A4V3CL5XvLoQ4sp487pJuQ.jpeg)

Chatuchak is closer to the MRT, but we need to go to King Power Mahanakhon, which is at BTS Chong Nonsi station; it takes about 1 KM (15 mins) to walk from Chatuchak to the nearest BTS Saphan Khwai station.
#### King Power Mahanakhon (Bangkok's King Power Tower)

Ticket price: THB 1,080 per person

Up close, it doesn't seem as towering as I imagined, but the architectural style is very unique, more cyberpunk.

You have to go through a security check before entering, and after buying the ticket, you get free luggage storage; backpacks are not allowed upstairs (small waist bags are fine).

_Free digital photos, staff will guide you to download them after the elevator ride._

The direct elevator has a 360-degree scene animation similar to Taipei 101 and the Tokyo Skytree; the height is about the same as Tokyo Tower.

Here’s the translated text in naturalistic English, keeping the original markdown image sources and URLs intact:

---

The elevator first takes you to the indoor observation deck on the 74th floor, where there's a café and some public seating for a quick rest. To reach the outdoor observation deck on the 78th floor, you’ll need to transfer to another elevator or take the stairs.

As soon as you arrive on the 78th floor, there’s a small bar where you can order a drink and enjoy the view.

After exiting the 78th floor, you can continue up the stairs to the top-level rest area.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dFRAU2mY_Qp9T0ru4GngIg.jpeg)

From the top floor, you can enjoy a panoramic view of Bangkok, and I can only imagine how beautiful the night view must be!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XOsqBu8PjCeB7XSlsD0_Fg.jpeg)

The stairs and the top-level rest area face the famous transparent glass corridor, where you can see straight down to the ground. You can grab shoe covers from a nearby box to enter, but **phones are not allowed inside; you can ask your companions or staff for help with photos.**

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*K2MOcxsrNbuNbz00sPfNOg.png)

The entire glass corridor isn’t very large, about the size of a rooftop infinity pool at a hotel. It doesn’t feel too high when you look from the side, but actually walking on it can be a bit scary and makes your legs feel weak. XD

### Ratchada Night Market (originally Ratchada Train Night Market)

![You can swipe your credit card directly at the MRT](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*BrfghHaJknyt6IiX7yOgbA.jpeg)

You can swipe your credit card directly at the MRT.

To get to Central Rama 9, you need to transfer to the MRT subway at Pharam 9 Station. The Rabbit Card cannot be used here, so you’ll need to buy a ticket or you can now use a VISA card to swipe in and out.

> _I tested the Taishin GoGo card, and it worked; I haven't tried the Cathay Cube._

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*c6Ug9F-JfXPzgnfvtvRvdg.jpeg)

For dinner, we came here to find something to eat. I must say that Bangkok's night markets and markets are far superior to those in Taiwan. The overall environment is clean, there are seating areas, it’s not chaotic, and it’s well-planned, making it very comfortable to stroll around.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1cBlgC7kvmt1fWeMfiDVMA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OVMfzMU1HugpE0CVyUiSVw.jpeg)

After browsing around, we first tried the dessert on the left (similar to egg cake?) and the savory seafood grill on the right. Both were quite chewy and tasty.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*K3ZN-Kiwz4yTiNHiZ3P1bg.jpeg)

Next up was the highlight: volcanic ribs. The flavor was quite unique, with a tangy lemongrass sauce. You can just put on gloves and dig in with your hands; it’s very appetizing!

After eating, we bought coconut ice cream with mango and peanut dessert from another stall, which was also delicious!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GamIzqKB9ROnECRfhPfA1Q.jpeg)

Afterward, we went back to Central Rama 9 to browse a bit. There’s also the famous NaRaYa Bangkok bags here.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*a5BcYS64yitoccK9TTU1HQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*csaO0X3lGf2TSIb3xQ8JWg.jpeg)

On the way back to the hotel, we happened to encounter Bangkok after a rain shower, with colorful digital advertising screens creating a striking contrast in colors, giving off a cyberpunk vibe.

#### 7-Eleven Hot Pressed Toast for Late Night Snack

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*xQi9q1iA7o6FyfAeEISTEw.jpeg)

On the way back to the hotel, I tried Thailand's [hot pressed toast from the convenience store](https://supertaste.tvbs.com.tw/pack/347495){:target="_blank"} along with Thai banana milk. The filling was melted cheese with a hot dog, and the crust was flaky! It was really delicious and cheap!

### 8/05 Day 4 Central World, Big C, Terminal 21

> **_Didn’t sleep well all night + hungover all day, feeling a bit dazed._**

#### Central World

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8pZ3crfkb4wIqZZOoI9-zA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6_evilQk4T0LdCYSIgBudg.jpeg)

In the morning, I headed out to shop at Central World.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Sp3TTqnEx3yn6IM4H38NsQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*tmLvijY5Q7TVJbMo4D4XFg.jpeg)

On the first floor, there’s a SHAKE SHACK burger place. I ordered the SHAKE SHACK signature burger and a coconut milkshake that’s exclusive to Bangkok. The burger was tasty and not greasy, but I found the milkshake a bit too sweet.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OXOp4dN-5p9xS1ojcu0b9A.jpeg)

The place is quite large, and like ICONSIAM, if you want to explore thoroughly, you won’t finish in one visit… I just did a quick browse and bought a shirt.

#### Big C

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*JNswfx_h01UuffS299HjgQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GWD-HcYbLfAQEAN99tErsw.jpeg)

After finishing at Central World, I walked across to Big C to buy snacks and souvenirs. (There are many options, but I didn’t find them cheaper…)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Bda3BGHI_ZeylIS96UNcWg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*DWtvvjZ3iAwk5U3MPZDudg.jpeg)

![Bottom left: Phutawan indoor diffuser was bought yesterday at Chatuchak, but I guess you can find it in department stores in the city too.](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*aMillKlyevVx8fDncaurSA.png)

The indoor diffuser from Phutawan was bought yesterday at Chatuchak, but I guess you can find it in department stores in the city too.

Additionally, it seems that Big C no longer provides plastic bags, so you have to buy eco-friendly bags in the store.

> _That big bag of dried durian actually only has two small bags inside… but it’s quite tasty._

#### Lunch

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*z4VW1WOelH7UjBco9PIAqg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*qWWrZXa_LRClqCTi7bZK3Q.png)

There’s a food market event in the outdoor plaza of Central World. It’s not just a simple setup with tents; it has a theme, and this time it’s Titanic. You can enter for free by following their official YouTube channel; the decorations inside are quite exquisite.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*9iurlEySgDL-ZQZzVGDiug.jpeg)

But for lunch, we ended up eating at SHAKE SHACK again, this time opting for the chicken thigh burger, which was just as delicious.

#### Afternoon: Returned to the hotel for a nap because I didn’t sleep well and was hungover… just too tired.

#### Dinner at Terminal 21

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8_lDD7yaIYIq7HV4zG4ClA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1T7njk_JYMi1eP1oMbjH-w.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*giNbQ1GPda-qPFaA8yQ7sQ.jpeg)

Terminal 21 is also a place you can’t finish exploring. Each floor has a different regional theme; for example, the Japan floor mainly sells Japanese products and restaurants.

I mainly met up with [Chun-Hsiu Liu](https://medium.com/u/72361fccaa43){:target="_blank"} at the food court upstairs for a meal. ( **A cheap and delicious dining spot that I highly recommend!** )

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ZyuBXqyjZtLw5zyVmarw6w.png)

In the food court, you just find a seat, and many locals come here to eat as well.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*a4MnqcM5Bi9jRPC3T29s5A.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*sYc87mPtI1nf3-9pk_F13w.png)

> _⚠️ **The payment method here is that the vendors don’t collect money directly. You need to go to the counter to exchange cash for a food card, and you pay with the QR code on the food card; after eating, return to the counter for a refund. (No deposit or handling fee required.)**_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*rt81B-Pc31OZeMlgG5M38Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*k1vmadbwhdJsJNmkllarLQ.jpeg)

There are many choices; just line up, tell them your number, and pay with the food card QR code; you can also take out (I remember there’s an additional THB 10 packaging fee).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Ol8uiQNEnE9tuZc-qbgqgQ.jpeg)

I ordered seafood fried noodles (THB 50) + pork chop with fries (THB 59) = THB 109.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t2R762mSI8CeoDWpSAuEKg.jpeg)

After eating, I also took a box of mango sticky rice to enjoy as a late-night snack back at the hotel.

It’s really delicious and cheap!!! A meal at a restaurant outside usually starts at THB 200–300, while here, most meals are around THB 50–80.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*G4G79vwVWj592tOApWbK2g.jpeg)

After eating, we went to the back to stroll around [Benjakitti Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bmKhQpbw9KTtLYeN8){:target="_blank"} and look for the legendary [Bangkok monitor lizard](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%B7%A8%E8%9C%A5%E4%BD%94%E9%A0%98%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8-%E8%A2%AB%E5%B0%81%E6%B3%B0%E7%89%88%E4%BE%8F%E7%BE%8E%E5%9C%92-104942584.html){:target="_blank"}; perhaps because it was nighttime, we didn’t see a single one.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dMZhzj3rAqhRWAVuxeS0XQ.jpeg)

Back at the hotel, my travel companion bought some mangosteen to try. I found the fresh ones delicious, with a subtle sweetness combined with the flavor of the mangosteen, very smooth. Later, I tried dried mangosteen, which wasn’t as good—just dry and sour.

> **_As for durians, they aren’t cheaper in Bangkok… a whole one is still THB 200 – 300._**

### 8/06 Day 5 Return Trip
#### Bangkok Monitor Lizard

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*E0M71hXTtQmzl2YP6kgPtw.jpeg)

In the morning, I wasn’t ready to give up and specifically went to [Lumphini Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n53FhsjXUUJLnghn6){:target="_blank"} to look for the legendary Bangkok monitor lizard. Due to time constraints, I only found one medium-sized lizard that had just come out to sunbathe.

> _Looking for the monitor lizard was just a personal whim of mine; locals reportedly dislike these lizards (water monitors) because they eat dirty things, so it’s best not to touch them._

#### 12:00 Back to the hotel to pick up luggage and head to the airport

My flight is at 15:20, so I need to leave by noon. It takes about an hour to get from the city to the airport.

From the hotel, the Grab fare was THB 577, and we needed to get on the highway; the driver paid the toll first, and the final Grab charge would include the toll fee. (I think it was around THB 50.)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ENH0G1_tBNWy-8RHV9XCag.jpeg)

The checked baggage limit was only 15 kg, and I managed to stick to that.

After clearing immigration around 13:20, the security checks at Bangkok airport are quite strict; everything must go through security, and carry-on bags are often opened for manual inspection.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7IrLBQONyc2Y0APyRYH9wQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*QLYTVQ2GpR2u9JpE6XeekA.jpeg)

After going through immigration and security checks, I had about an hour to grab a bite to eat, so I found a Thai restaurant for my last meal in Thailand. I had seafood fried rice, mango juice, and mango sticky rice.

> _Many shops sell mango sticky rice in takeout boxes after you leave the country, so if you can't get enough, you can buy some to eat on the plane!_

> _**\(⚠️ But remember, it's prohibited to bring it back to Taiwan ⚠️\)**_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ouwulscC2q0OsIujIa2iXg.jpeg)

I have to give this bottle of water a close-up because the budget airline didn't provide anything, and I thought I could buy water at the airport. However, after passing through immigration, a bottle of mineral water costs THB 70 — 100, and this one was THB 100.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*rOoff9qAZL6L4LjXH4DNfw.jpeg)

BKK is huge... filled with Trip.com advertisements. My return flight was on time, so I took the shuttle bus to the terminal.
#### Back in Taiwan

I arrived at TPE Taoyuan International Airport, picked up my luggage, and headed straight to catch the `1841` or `1819` Kuo-Kuang bus back to Taipei. It was very convenient without needing to transfer.
### ⚠️ Safety Tips and Precautions for Traveling in Bangkok ⚠️

The most important thing when going out is safety, so here’s a summary of safety tips and precautions.
#### Scam Prevention

[![Common scams in Thailand that people still fall for!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o42r-bg16Fg){:target="_blank"}](/assets/b7e7c0938985/07b5_hqdefault.jpg)

The following tips are summarized from a video by the Bangkok Cat. I actually encountered a currency exchange scam this time.
1. Incorrect calculations
   This may not always be intentional; you can calculate the total amount when ordering.
2. People approaching you to show you your country's currency or ask if you want to exchange money
   When you pull out your wallet, they might steal or pickpocket you.
3. Outside the Grand Palace or attractions, someone might falsely claim the site is closed and enthusiastically suggest you take a tuk-tuk to other places (like **private boat rides, which I encountered at the pier this time**) to scam you into spending money.
4. Tuk-tuks often have inflated prices or suddenly increase the fare halfway through the ride.
   If you want to experience a tuk-tuk but are worried about being overcharged, [you can try the new MUVMI app for tuk-tuk rides](https://bkk.com.tw/muvmi-app/){:target="_blank"}.
   Even if a tuk-tuk looks good, be cautious of scam #3, where they enthusiastically suggest you visit attractions or take a boat ride.
5. Fake staff members may approach you while you’re waiting in line, enthusiastically inviting you inside.
   They might use your language to explain the menu, help you order, and then say you need to pay upfront, taking your money and running.
6. Motorcycle rental scams
   Never leave your passport as a deposit; never leave your passport as a deposit; never leave your passport as a deposit.
   If you encounter malicious scams claiming you damaged something and demanding compensation, leaving your passport can lead to trouble.
   It's better to rent from larger chain rental companies, and always take video footage of the vehicle's condition before renting.
7. Local dating app scams
   You might end up meeting a ladyboy, a scammer, or someone with ulterior motives.
8. The Patpong ping pong show scam, where enthusiastic promoters ask if you want to see a ping pong show, claiming you only need to buy a drink for THB 100, then take you into a dark alley or a shady establishment.
   It's hard to leave, and when you try, they might demand THB 3,000, saying there was no such thing as THB 100.
9. Be cautious of pickpockets in crowded places, even in areas where you need to buy tickets to enter (e.g., the Grand Palace, Wat Pho).

#### 🌿🚬

This will be banned next year, but I can share some experiences.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️ Edibles (like gummies) can be very potent, and the scary part is that while eating them, they feel just like regular gummies, and the effects can hit you suddenly after a few hours ⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- It's best to try them gradually: eat 1/3, wait a few hours... if nothing happens, eat 2/3... wait a few hours... if you feel something, then try eating one whole piece...
- For smoking, it's also best to start gradually based on your tolerance.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️ I strongly recommend trying them only in your hotel; if you feel out of it, you can rest directly, which is safer ⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- Just because you drink doesn't mean you have a higher tolerance.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️** Your heart rate may increase and feel uncomfortable **⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- It's safer to have someone sober around to take care of you if needed.
- Smoking is only appropriate in specific situations.

#### Other Tips
- Thailand is not a tipping culture, so generally, you don't need to tip; I only leave a THB 20 tip for massages as a gesture.
- Alcohol can only be sold from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM and from 5:00 PM to midnight; it is prohibited all day on Buddhist holidays.
- Not all hotel balconies allow smoking, so be sure to ask.
- For foreigners, the emergency assistance number is `1155`.
- SuperRich has specific business hours, so if you arrive too early or too late, you won't be able to exchange money.

[_Located in the Seven Rocks area on the way from Bangkok to Hua Hin, Santorini Park is a popular weekend spot for Thai families and a great place for photo ops. Highly recommended for a romantic stroll in this charming park._](https://www.bring-you.info/zh-tw/santorini-park){:target="_blank"}

It seems like a small amusement park with Greek-style scenery.
#### [Hua Hin Artist Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UcF7Wd82aHq4aGP86){:target="_blank"}

A well-known attraction that is still open in 2024.

There are many paintings and artworks.
#### Back to Sheraton to enjoy the facilities and beach

The hotel is in a villa style, with each room being a standalone unit. The swimming pool surrounds all the rooms, and there's a bar by the pool; the beach outside is undeveloped and desolate.

After dinner, we went to a nearby night market.
### Day 3
#### [Maeklong Railway Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Jsbm5FFwYf2ArEW36){:target="_blank"}

It was too early, so everyone decided not to go.
#### [Damnoen Saduak Floating Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tKSTmHgaHc4YCbpZ6){:target="_blank"}

I remember it being quite thrilling and adventurous, even though the water was murky and had a smell.
#### Head to Bangkok for a 2-night stay at [Marriott Queens Park Bangkok](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Bzq2EGFrsxsRTKpj9){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*qy7YBGcWTMfpItXtapHr9g.jpeg)

The guide specifically told the staff not to step on my back. I remember it being very luxurious, but it was painful enough that I couldn't sleep XD.
#### [River City Shopping Complex](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L3Pnv1BpLCpcGs7G7){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7tYE57IoZUXg1gQhWuSa8g.jpeg)

Since we were going on the Chao Phraya Princess cruise for a buffet dinner that night, we stopped by the nearby shopping mall first.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*EEELplqEfG3bLcGUoLAvRQ.jpeg)

I remember the food being decent, but the main highlight was the beautiful night view, where you could see the lights of the [Asiatique Ferris Wheel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/evFHo6ciFY4jswSt9){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6pzhTRcjRh_b6Z4jOJH_fg.jpeg)

After returning to the hotel, we went to the bar on the top floor of the Marriott for a drink. I just remember the night view being beautiful and the drinks being cheap.
### Day 4 Free Day

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*NU2LiyNLR8lgf7phtPYKHg.jpeg)

I only remember going shopping at the mall, Big C, and Central World.
#### In the evening, we went to [Zoom Sky Bar](https://www.kkday.com/zh-hk/product/105589-zoom-sky-bar-anantara-sathorn-bangkok-package?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} at the Anantara Sathorn Hotel for drinks.

### Day 5 Return Trip

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*SpSAMDAk7Pp7SSCrmCyBQQ.jpeg)

That's the memory of the 2018 staff trip. This time, returning to Bangkok for a fully independent trip made me more familiar with the city. Compared to my previous visit, I feel it's more prosperous, the food is better, and prices have increased since then.
