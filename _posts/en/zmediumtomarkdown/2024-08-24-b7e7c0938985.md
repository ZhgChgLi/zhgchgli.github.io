### [Travelogue] 2024 Thailand Bangkok 🇹🇭 5-Day Independent Trip

Post-pandemic revisit to Thailand: A five-day quick trip to Bangkok.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*kRZZjY_7_6WaKRkw9E74iw.jpeg)

#### Memories of Bangkok

Back in 2018, my first company trip during my first job was also my first time traveling abroad, a 5-day trip to Bangkok and Hua Hin, Thailand. The following year, 2019, I went on another company trip to Sabah. Then came the two years lost to the pandemic. After the pandemic ended, I started going crazy over independent trips to Japan.

At that time, I was a total rookie with zero social experience, cluelessly following my older brother and sister. I didn’t even know what was allowed on the plane. During security check, I foolishly put my passport on top of the basket, and when it came out of the machine, I realized it had fallen on the conveyor belt, nearly panicking (if it had fallen into the gap, I wouldn’t have been able to get it back). That trip was just blindly joining a tour group and riding the bus without thinking. My impression of Bangkok was vague—I only remembered the rooftop bar was great, the weather was hot, things were cheap, and massages were affordable. I had no idea about the geography at all.

Therefore, I always wanted to revisit Bangkok to refresh my memories from six years ago; however, being unfamiliar with Southeast Asia, I was hesitant to travel alone. **At the beginning of the year, while chatting with Pinkoi colleagues, we decided to organize this five-day independent trip to Bangkok.**

> *The detailed itinerary and memories of the 2018 five-day trip to Bangkok and Hua Hin are included in the appendix at the end of the article.*

Since I started a new job in June, I haven't had much time for leisure. Mark and Sean mainly handled the arrangements and planning, so I didn't do much research.

#### Network

This time, the preparation was rushed. The internet wasn't set up until the day before, and there was no time to buy my usual physical SIM card. Fortunately, I tried eSIM for the first time. (Loved it after using it)

Buy directly from KKday [**Thailand SIM Card｜AIS 5G High-Speed Network 8 Days Unlimited Data + Calls eSIM**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}. After purchase, you will immediately receive the eSIM activation voucher and can start using it right away.

#### Flight Tickets 🛫

- Outbound: TPE 16:00 -> BKK 18:45

- Return: BKK 15:20 -> TPE 20:10

Airline: Thai VietJet Air (Low-cost carrier)

Price: `TWD $9,259` (includes additional round-trip **15 kg** checked baggage)

At first, I thought about traveling with everyone. My friend didn't check in luggage (the ticket price was about `$6,000`), but after checking other airlines, I felt like I missed out; other airlines at similar times cost around `$10,000`, not much difference, but much more comfortable!

Thai VietJet Air's baggage policy actually allows you to avoid checked baggage. You can carry two pieces of hand luggage with a total weight not exceeding 7 kg.

```
1. Carry-on luggage weight:
Each passenger (except infants) can bring 1 piece of personal luggage and 1 small carry-on bag, with a maximum total weight of 7 kg.

2. Carry-on luggage size:
- 1 piece of carry-on luggage with maximum dimensions of 56cm x 36cm x 23cm
- 1 small carry-on bag (including the following bags)
  + 1 bag for girls, magazines, camera, baby food bag, airport-purchased bags not exceeding 30cm x 20cm x 10cm, etc.
  + 1 bag for a coat, which when opened must not exceed 114cm x 60cm x 11cm
  + 1 bag for a laptop with maximum dimensions of 40cm x 30cm x 10cm
```

Basically, just carry a backpack and pull a carry-on suitcase.

### 8/02 Day 1 Departure

#### Around 12:30 PM, leave home after work

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*YsFObRlulrMFKHySvo3NAw.jpeg)

> *Remember to take the Airport Express direct train; even if the regular train is earlier in the morning, it won't arrive before the direct train!*

#### Around 13:30 Arrive at Taoyuan Airport Terminal 1

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*BBE4RhKU9tcJI427_LoQMw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ksagRFmStL9nLBWIyYY3Jg.png)

The check-in counter was completely empty. Upon arrival, I checked in and completed the baggage drop-off immediately.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GI5u8vhrNRbFdG-XqY_2LQ.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*CBOJ0KHI4dMmAP5REh1UaA.jpeg)

B1R again, the gate at the farthest corner + requires a shuttle bus.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XMQJOe1n5vyVdWQrYJpgNg.png)

It's still early before 4 PM, so once again, I came to eat Yi Hang Ding Gua Gua. This time, I found out you can order Gua Gua buns separately, which used to sell only fried chicken!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*hfpWAbwiM2Aal3MZJ36oOA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XNjYtycibxeowQBaDT_jNw.jpeg)

I just found out that if you walk straight ahead from Ding Gua Gua, you can reach Terminal 2. So if you have plenty of time, you can go to Terminal 2 to eat; or you can come from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1 to use the free VIP lounge for a rest XD

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t4dk8GQIv0D53N0V_qo7KA.png)

After buying Ding Gua Gua, I went to the Terminal 1 free VIP lounge to sit, rest, and eat. This time, I saw someone charging their device. [Last time I came, all the outlets were removed; it seems they have been fixed](../cb65fd5ab770/) (?).

#### Around 15:30, head to B1R waiting lounge

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*2Ros8CQBKj0-kkMugSZ7Hg.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*At7elbjIueB9lvvenvlfTA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*fpzrwzWez_HwgKFuFmDAhA.png)

Not sure if it's because of the low-cost airline, but the information hasn't been updated (it kept showing 16:00, but the actual time changed to 16:35).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*puKndBRQgCKs3LKbXbzEWw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*zCT2uidCELNc7WL1NpW72Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1aGwmjed9srQtHli3uDoxg.jpeg)

With the flight delayed again, the actual departure time was 17:13.

- VietJet's seats are about the same size as Tigerair's, both larger than Peach's. However, the seats are uncomfortable, the leather material is not breathable, and sitting for a long time causes pain.

- VietJet should allow bringing your own food. On the return flight, someone ate mango sticky rice they bought without any issues.

#### 19:30 Arrive at Bangkok BKK Suvarnabhumi Airport

I heard from colleagues that if you arrive at Bangkok airport during peak hours, you can purchase the [**Thailand Airport BKK Departure Meet and Greet Fast Track VIP Service**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/160605?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} to use the fast lane XD. However, we arrived at a time when almost only passengers from our flight were there, so the clearance was very quick.

#### 20:00 Collect luggage and exit the airport

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*QDvOtf4PsS-jSESOkb-0AA.jpeg)

Maybe because it's a low-cost airline, few people checked in luggage, so baggage claim was super fast.

#### eSIM Network Settings

As soon as I left the airport and started figuring out how to set up and activate the eSIM, I realized...

> ***⚠️ Activating eSIM requires an internet connection ⚠️***

> ***⚠️Activating eSIM requires an internet connection⚠️***

> ***⚠️eSIM activation requires an internet connection⚠️***

It's like buying a pair of scissors but needing another pair to cut it open. Activating eSIM requires an internet connection first; luckily, my friend who traveled with me had already activated their eSIM in Taiwan, so I used their network to activate mine. (There is also Wi-Fi available at the airport, so no need to worry too much.)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*_xv7JB_yl7d47ljrUTpYdw.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6vg_zfmf6tr3SIBUj6gi4A.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7-7yMcMgwbpNzBq1YgknaQ.png)

To activate eSIM, simply long-press the QR code and select Add eSIM.

> ***For some reason, if you save the QR code to Photos or Notes, the quick add feature stops working. Another way is to send the QR code to your companion or print it out for the phone to scan.***

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*hZBZoEJCLuHxEgbOVMEXBw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*KMKLtNg2Aaeug_cn5fitNQ.jpeg)

iPhone iOS eSIM Manual Setup Path: Settings -> Cellular -> Add eSIM -> Scan QR Code -> Enter Information Manually -> Input Details from Email -> Use As... You can select "Travel" -> Choose "Travel" for Cellular Data -> Done!

After activation, it works like dual SIM dual standby. However, before purchasing a roaming plan for the original SIM card, there is no internet. **In emergencies, you can still switch back to the original SIM card!**

#### 20:30 Finding Food at the Airport

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*mDPRItCdp28u5P6tTQelqQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*bgHNI9p20Jyf3t3IMDExMQ.jpeg)

Since it takes over an hour to get to the city and hotel, and the low-cost airline doesn't provide meals, everyone was starving, so we looked for food at the airport for dinner first.

Found a Thai restaurant to eat at. The spicy minced pork is really hot and satisfying, and pairing it with vegetable soup helps ease the spiciness.

#### 21:00 Move to the hotel

> *👉👉👉You can refer to KKday airport transfer services:*

> *[- Thailand｜Airport Private Transfer｜Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) / Don Mueang Airport (DMK) — Bangkok/Pattaya/Hua Hin City Hotels](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/3431-bkk-or-dmk-bangkok-private-transfer?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}*

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*cagHOMc-TKS9fmhN18zVOQ.png)

After eating around 21:00, start heading towards the city center and the hotel.

**Taking public transportation requires three transfers between the subway and BTS:**

1. Airport Rail Link `Suvarnabhumi` -> `Phaya Thai`

2. BTS Sukhumvit Line `Phaya Thai` -> `Siam`

3. BTS Silom Line `Siam` -> `Chong Nonsi`

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*PeWlfQ6fd55mU1Ojk0isJQ.png)

- Airport Express tickets can only be purchased.

- BTS cards can be reloaded and used for entry and exit at ticket counters.

- Please note that **the Rabbit Card can only be used on BTS**, and cannot be used on MRT or the Airport Rail Link.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Dom8OdbMSRAAXtFpykCTZQ.png)

- Arrived at `Chong Nonsi` (Later found out that King Power Mahanakhon Building is at this station!)

#### Walk to [JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL 曼谷JC 凯文沙吞酒店](https://jckevin.com/){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6VrvZBTlo2gjg_lY7oQG8w.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*cgv3HGHsAkH8WL_jA6qTsg.jpeg)

When exiting BTS, don't rush to go down the overpass; you can walk across the street using the overpass.

> ***The path was quite dark (not many streetlights), and it was a bit far to walk (15 mins / 1 KM). Walking alone at night could be scary.*** *Along the way, I passed a 7–11 and a small night market. I bought some food at 7–11 to bring back to the hotel.*

> *Also, if taking a taxi, because of the two-way road and U-turn restrictions, the driver must pass the hotel a short distance to the next gap before turning back, which is somewhat inconvenient.*

#### 10:30 JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL Bangkok JC Kevin Sathorn Hotel

Arrived at the hotel around 10:30.

[![JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL Bangkok JC Kevin Sathorn Hotel](/assets/b7e7c0938985/43d8_hqdefault.jpg "JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL Bangkok JC Kevin Sathorn Hotel")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg24V_VS6oA){:target="_blank"}

The room is very spacious, a full apartment-style unit with a master bedroom, a second bedroom, two bathrooms, a kitchen, a living room, and a balcony.

#### 2018 Memories

What a coincidence! Back in 2018, during a company group tour to Bangkok, we all took taxis at night to this rooftop bar, which is actually the bar of this hotel XD

Additionally, it also offers a Sky Bar dinner package:

#### 2024

Since we were staying here this time, we went upstairs to take a look after putting our luggage in the room.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*h8ksUQqToXHPTda_RnwkSg.jpeg)

Since it was already past dinner time, we could only order some snacks and grilled skewers.

### 8/03 Day 2 Wat Pho, Grand Palace, Wat Phra Kaew, Wat Arun, ICONSIAM, Lhao Lhao, Rock Pub Live

#### Hotel Breakfast

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t1xva8yggECe94znx32pew.jpeg)

After having breakfast at the hotel in the morning, we went out. I thought the breakfast was okay, but there weren't many choices.

#### 9:30 Departure

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*A2zezLiqIEOngnuebgxUjA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dZQvSlCNcBjgE4-mdnFZMQ.jpeg)

Because there were many people, we took a Grab (THB 135) directly to Wat Pho.

On the way, we passed through [Chinatown](https://www.kkday.com/zh-hk/blog/101689/bangkokchinatown?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}, but forgot to take photos. It had a strong cyberpunk vibe!

Entering requires removing shoes. You can walk around the Reclining Buddha at Wat Pho for worship.

#### SuperRich Currency Exchange

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GKVidaEFygfEMNjfKFNweA.jpeg)

After leaving Wat Pho, we decided to handle currency exchange first. Only one friend had exchanged some Thai Baht in advance; the rest planned to exchange money in Bangkok. So, we went to the nearby [The Old Siam Shopping Plaza⁩](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UPNxgoTmtswuhHVS8){:target="_blank"} and used the SuperRich currency exchange inside.

**⚠️ Please note: The New Taiwan Dollar bills to be exchanged must not have stains, markings, etc., or they will be rejected. (For example, a 1000 NTD bill withdrawn from a Taiwan ATM with pencil markings was rejected for exchange.)**

> *NTD $5,000 exchanged for THB $5,200*

Khanom bueang Thai-style pancakes

After exchanging money and having some cash, I replenished my energy at the food market on the first floor; I ate Thai crispy pancakes (ขนมเบื้อง), the sweet kind filled with meringue that tasted very sweet, like cotton candy, and also banana pancakes; finally, I bought a cup of iced coffee and continued on.

#### Grand Palace and Temple of the Emerald Buddha

Ticket: THB 500/person.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*NVu8tXAG7D3sGNRQi-PHGw.jpeg)

The time was around 1 PM. After leaving the Grand Palace, we grabbed lunch at a Western restaurant near the pier.

#### 14:00 Prepare to board the boat to Wat Arun

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ePMFJ1jf5orPQRQTEJHMnQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*J5lIB0rYWPqPWrgkkNlB2g.jpeg)

> ***⚠️ Outside the pier, people may approach you asking where you're going. Be cautious, as they are private boat operators charging high fees (THB 500, 1000) and are unsafe; ignore them and find the official pier and counter to state your destination. ⚠️***

> ***The official fare is only THB 30 (*** *`Tha Chang` **to Wat Arun), the new boats have air conditioning, are safe, and comfortable.***

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*oc8bbW-4ZZwQeFkqNhXwNw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ccUJ7WKGfb73k8UWEDNesg.jpeg)

When the boat arrives, the staff will call out "鄭王廟" (yes, in Chinese). If you're unsure, you can always ask.

The afternoon is approaching with thunderstorms, and you can see the water flowing turbid and fast.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8hMHmiUOANTISYOVpTISiA.jpeg)

The boat is very new, the air conditioning is cool, it is enclosed and very safe, and there are many convenient schedules!

Station staff will also call out "Zheng Wang Temple."

#### 14:30 Arrive at Wat Arun

Ticket Price: THB 200

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*yO651kLqUcD8FPfH2KH1Sw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ujWr_UkXTX__M2jEz06sUw.jpeg)

After getting off the boat, you will arrive at the King Rama Shrine, where you can queue up directly to buy tickets for entry.

> ***⚠️ Cheng Wang Temple also has a dress code ⚠️***

> ***No off-shoulder tops, shorts, crop tops, or short skirts allowed.***

> ***You can wear traditional Thai clothing; many people wear it for photos.***

You can walk to the middle platform to take photos (⚠️ the stairs are steep, so be careful). Many people also change into traditional Thai costumes here for photo souvenirs.

After visiting, return to the pier and first find the ticket booth (PIER 2) to buy a ticket to ICONSIAM (THB 40), then go to PIER 1 to board.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*MbiMV91xnwXQqSTg4UUx1g.jpeg)

ICONSIAM is very large and looks luxurious. The food court on the first floor is quite unique.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*fuuOJMUI4D8F0zPOEH1geg.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*eLZgR_Wmmnt0oWkwO-d-KQ.jpeg)

Buy a cup of ChaTraMue Thai Tea to recharge your energy.

Walked all the way to the BTS Charoen Nakhon platform, decided to get a one-hour foot massage first.

There is a newer, larger place outside called (1) THAI GARDEN MASSAGE, but they had no available spots when I asked. Fortunately, I kept walking and found (2) another massage shop with seats as shown in the picture. I found it very comfortable, less crowded, spacious, quieter, and the price was cheap (foot massage/1 hour/THB 270).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*s6--mVkXnO3wqrcTHRgL0Q.png)

After pressing it, I had the energy to continue shopping and returned to ICONSIAM; walking all the way to the upstairs restaurant, which was also very extravagant, with a jungle, small bridges with flowing water, and waterfalls. Overall, it was very nice!

> *Bought the famous Japanese potato sticks TORO FRIES (long queue) to recharge.*

> *Here they also have Japanese % coffee.*

#### Going to LHAO LHAO for a Dinner Appointment

This is a branch line with only three stops and fewer services.

> *Google Map seems to have no information about this BTS line; it suggests I walk to Krung Thon Buri.*

From here, take one stop to Krung Thon Buri, which is on the Silom Line.

At Siam, transfer to the Sukhumvit Line and get off at Ari station. A short walk from there is the LHAO LHAO restaurant.

#### 19:00 [LHAO LHAO](https://bkk.com.tw/2012-12-12-186/#LHAO_LHAO_%E7%A8%80%E9%A3%AF%EF%BC%88%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%95%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%95%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B8%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%87%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B2%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B2%EF%BC%89){:target="_blank"}

The owner seems to be Chinese, and it feels like a fusion of Chinese and Thai cuisine. It's a highly rated, well-established restaurant and apparently a favorite of Blackpink's LISA.

Because I'm going to a pub to listen to live music later, I ate quickly, but I thought every dish was very delicious!!

- In Figures 1–3 above, the background behind the Goose Brand cooling ointment, the dish that looks like minced pork, is called หมูสับผัดหนำเลี้ยบ. It appears to be olive vegetable stir-fried with minced meat, and it pairs very well with rice!

- In Figure 2-1 above, fried oyster omelette, similar to the bomb oyster omelette at Taiwan's Shilin Night Market.

- Figure 2-2 above, seasonal limited drink, Longan Tea

- In Figure 2-3 above, the most special dish is the curry crab (Panang Curry), made with a whole fresh large crab.

> *The Thai-recommended Eagle Brand cooling balm, which I later bought, smells milder than menthol nasal inhalers and causes less nasal irritation!*

#### 20:00 [The Rock Pub](https://www.instagram.com/therockpub/){:target="_blank"}

After eating, head to The Rock Pub for drinks and live music.

Cat lover here, Bangkok has many cats, and they immediately come to rub against me.

Early in the morning, I took a Grab to [Wang Chun Sheng Beef Hotpot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1VuwzAdKS4vH6kmj6){:target="_blank"} for breakfast. The overall flavor is quite Chinese/Taiwanese style, which I liked, but Tainan beef soup is even better.

> *After eating, I headed to Chatuchak Market. Since Chatuchak is quite far and I didn't want to walk or transfer BTS, I took an Uber directly (THB 374).*

Chatuchak covers a large area with dense vendors, but it is generally clean and pleasant to explore. However, many items are repetitive and appear to be Made in China products aimed at tourists.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GJv4mk3v2-DptRofTF_9zg.jpeg)

Finally, I only bought a Thai brand, Thailand Phutawan indoor diffuser, as a souvenir.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*28EbS8N3OUJwSCPrgaTb8Q.png)

If you get tired from walking, just step into the massage shop inside for foot and some shoulder and neck massage. (1 hour/THB 250)

#### Restroom

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*tGe2u5gIF70mPz3d7sX5XQ.jpeg)

If you need to use the restroom at Chatuchak, there are paid toilets (THB 5 per use) around the market. I have used them; they are very clean, with one stall per person, and are regularly cleaned. If you don't want to pay, you can also go to the nearby [Mixt Chatuchak](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5PwQcFThBHtFpbzw6){:target="_blank"} mall, which has free and equally clean restrooms.

After eating, we continued exploring and bought a cup of durian juice to drink. The flavor was rich and authentic, and the price was reasonable (THB 89).

> *Later, I found that items at Chatuchak are actually cheaper. For example, a pack of 6 peppermint nasal inhalers costs 99 baht here, while Big C sells the same pack for 140 baht… also, durian juice is similar, sold for over 140 baht per cup in city night markets.*

#### 15:00 Take the BTS to King Power Mahanakhon Building

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*A4V3CL5XvLoQ4sp487pJuQ.jpeg)

Chatuchak is closer to the MRT, but we need to go to the King Power Complex at BTS Chong Nonsi station; walking from Chatuchak to the nearest BTS Saphan Khwai station is about 1 KM (15 mins).

#### King Power Mahanakhon (Bangkok Grand Kyoto Building)

*Free synthesized digital photos; after visiting, staff will guide you to download them when you come down the elevator*

The express elevator features a 360-degree panoramic animation, similar to Taipei 101 and Tokyo Skytree; its height is roughly comparable to Tokyo Tower.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*sP_hQ4hGSKCygeaSgltHpQ.jpeg)

The elevator first stops at the indoor observation deck on the 74th floor, where there is a café and public seating for a short break. To reach the outdoor observation deck on the top floor, you need to transfer to another elevator or take the stairs up to the 78th floor.

On the 78th floor, there is a small bar where you can order a drink and enjoy the view while sitting.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*PeqjUWSwE1Hh24qWkioTxA.png)

After reaching the 78th floor, you can continue upwards to the stairs and the rooftop lounge.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dFRAU2mY_Qp9T0ru4GngIg.jpeg)

The rooftop offers a panoramic view of the entire Bangkok city, and you can imagine the night view must be beautiful as well!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*f4eREu0dL79OzsYCtl1O9A.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XOsqBu8PjCeB7XSlsD0_Fg.jpeg)

The stairs and rooftop lounge face the famous transparent glass corridor, offering a direct vertical view of the ground. You can take shoe covers from the nearby box to enter, but **bringing phones is prohibited. You can ask a companion or staff to help take photos.**

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*K2MOcxsrNbuNbz00sPfNOg.png)

The entire glass corridor isn't very large, about the size of a hotel's rooftop infinity pool. From the side, it doesn't seem very high, but actually walking on it can be scary and make your legs weak XD

### Jod Night Market (formerly Ratchada Train Night Market)

![MRT can be paid directly with a credit card](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*BrfghHaJknyt6IiX7yOgbA.jpeg)

MRT can be accessed directly with a credit card.

To get to Central Rama 9, you need to transfer to the MRT subway to Phra Ram 9 station. You cannot use the Rabbit Card; you must buy a ticket or you can now use a VISA card to tap in and out directly.

> *Tested with Taishin GoGo Card, it works; Cathay Cube not tested.*

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*c6Ug9F-JfXPzgnfvtvRvdg.jpeg)

For dinner here, I have to say Bangkok's night markets and bazaars are far better than Taiwan's. The overall environment is clean, there are seating areas, it's not chaotic, and well organized, making it very comfortable to explore.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1cBlgC7kvmt1fWeMfiDVMA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OVMfzMU1HugpE0CVyUiSVw.jpeg)

After walking around, I first tried the dessert on the left (similar to egg waffles?), and the savory seafood grill on the right. Both have a chewy texture and taste quite good.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*31mIDWp4WgTX8TSK5Q-C4Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*K3ZN-Kiwz4yTiNHiZ3P1bg.jpeg)

Next is the highlight, the volcano ribs. The flavor is quite unique, with a lemongrass sour and spicy sauce. You can put on gloves and eat it with your hands, which is very appetizing!

After eating, I bought coconut ice cream with mango and peanut dessert from another stall, which was also delicious!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GamIzqKB9ROnECRfhPfA1Q.jpeg)

After eating, return to Central Rama 9 for some shopping. There is also the famous NaRaYa Bangkok bags here.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*a5BcYS64yitoccK9TTU1HQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*csaO0X3lGf2TSIb3xQ8JWg.jpeg)

On the way back to the hotel, I happened to see Bangkok after the rain paired with colorful digital advertising screens. The color contrast was maxed out, giving a strong cyberpunk vibe.

#### 7–11 Grilled Toast Late-Night Snack

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*xQi9q1iA7o6FyfAeEISTEw.jpeg)

On the way back to the hotel, I tried Thailand's [convenience store grilled toast](https://supertaste.tvbs.com.tw/pack/347495){:target="_blank"} and Thai banana milk. The filling was melted cheese and hot dog, and the crust was crispy! The crust was crispy! The crust was crispy! It was delicious and cheap!

### 8/05 Day 4 Central World, Big C, Terminal 21

> ***Didn't sleep well all night + hungover all day, feeling dazed.***

#### Central World

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8pZ3crfkb4wIqZZOoI9-zA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6_evilQk4T0LdCYSIgBudg.jpeg)

Went out to Central World for shopping right after waking up in the morning.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Sp3TTqnEx3yn6IM4H38NsQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*tmLvijY5Q7TVJbMo4D4XFg.jpeg)

On the first floor, there is a SHAKE SHACK burger. I tried it for the first time and ordered the signature SHAKE SHACK burger and the coconut milk shake, which is only available in Bangkok. The burger was tasty and not greasy, but I found the milkshake too sweet.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OXOp4dN-5p9xS1ojcu0b9A.jpeg)

It's very large, just like ICONSIAM. If you want to explore thoroughly, you can't finish... I just took a quick look around and casually bought a shirt.

#### Big C

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*JNswfx_h01UuffS299HjgQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GWD-HcYbLfAQEAN99tErsw.jpeg)

After shopping at Central World, just walk across to Big C to buy snacks and souvenirs. (There are many options, but I don't think it's cheaper…)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Bda3BGHI_ZeylIS96UNcWg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*DWtvvjZ3iAwk5U3MPZDudg.jpeg)

![Bottom left: Phutawan indoor diffuser was bought yesterday at Chatuchak, but I guess city department stores also have it.](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*aMillKlyevVx8fDncaurSA.png)

Bottom left Phutawan indoor diffuser was bought yesterday at Chatuchak, but I guess department stores in the city also carry it.

Additionally, Big C now seems to no longer provide plastic bags; you need to buy reusable bags inside the store.

> *That big pack of dried durian actually contains only two small packs inside... but it tastes quite good.*

#### Lunch

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*z4VW1WOelH7UjBco9PIAqg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*qWWrZXa_LRClqCTi7bZK3Q.png)

The outdoor plaza at Central World hosts a food market event, which is more than just simple stalls and tents. It has a main theme, and this time it’s Titanic. You can enter for free by following their official YouTube channel. The interior is also decorated very elaborately.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*9iurlEySgDL-ZQZzVGDiug.jpeg)

But for lunch, we went to SHAKE SHACK again and tried the chicken thigh burger this time, which was equally delicious.

#### Afternoon: Return to the hotel for a nap due to poor sleep and hangover... feeling extremely tired

#### Dinner at Terminal 21 Airport Mall

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8_lDD7yaIYIq7HV4zG4ClA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1T7njk_JYMi1eP1oMbjH-w.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*giNbQ1GPda-qPFaA8yQ7sQ.jpeg)

Terminal 21 is also endless to explore, with each floor featuring a different regional theme. For example, the Japan floor mainly sells Japanese products and has Japanese restaurants.

Mainly arranged to eat at the food court upstairs with [Chun-Hsiu Liu](https://medium.com/u/72361fccaa43){:target="_blank"}. ( **Affordable and delicious, highly recommended dining spot** )

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ZyuBXqyjZtLw5zyVmarw6w.png)

At the food court, find a seat yourself; many locals also come here to eat.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*a4MnqcM5Bi9jRPC3T29s5A.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*sYc87mPtI1nf3-9pk_F13w.png)

> *⚠️ **Payment method here: the store does not accept direct payment. You must first go to the counter to exchange cash for a food card, then use the QR code on the food card to pay; after eating, return the card to the counter for a refund. (No deposit or handling fee required)***

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*rt81B-Pc31OZeMlgG5M38Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*k1vmadbwhdJsJNmkllarLQ.jpeg)

There are quite a few options. Just queue up, say your number, and pay with the food card QR code. Takeout is also available (I recall an extra THB 10 packaging fee).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Ol8uiQNEnE9tuZc-qbgqgQ.jpeg)

Ordered seafood fried instant noodles (THB 50) + pork chop with fries (THB 59) = THB 109

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t2R762mSI8CeoDWpSAuEKg.jpeg)

After eating, I also took a box of mango sticky rice to go for a late-night snack back at the hotel.

The food is really delicious and cheap!!! A meal at a restaurant outside usually starts at 200–300 THB, but here almost every meal costs only 50–80 THB.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*G4G79vwVWj592tOApWbK2g.jpeg)

After eating, we went for a walk in the nearby [Banjachit Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bmKhQpbw9KTtLYeN8){:target="_blank"} and tried to find the legendary [Bangkok Giant Lizard](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%B7%A8%E8%9C%A5%E4%BD%94%E9%A0%98%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8-%E8%A2%AB%E5%B0%81%E6%B3%B0%E7%89%88%E4%BE%8F%E7%BE%85%E7%B4%80%E5%85%AC%E5%9C%92-104942584.html){:target="_blank"}; maybe because it was evening, we didn’t see any.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dMZhzj3rAqhRWAVuxeS0XQ.jpeg)

Back at the hotel, my travel companions bought some mangosteen to try. I found the fresh ones delicious, with a light sweetness combined with the mangosteen flavor, making it very smooth. Later, I tried dried mangosteen, but it didn't taste as good—just dry and sour.

> ***As for durians, durians in Bangkok are not cheaper... a whole durian costs THB 200 – 300.***

### 8/06 Day 5 Return Trip

#### Bangkok Monitor Lizard

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6oX4YygURRzsrDmv_OAJ2Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*E0M71hXTtQmzl2YP6kgPtw.jpeg)

In the morning, still determined, I went to [Lumphini Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n53FhsjXUUJLnghn6){:target="_blank"} to find the legendary Bangkok monitor lizard. Due to limited time, I only found a medium-sized lizard basking in the sun.

> *Looking for large monitor lizards was just a personal boring activity. Locals reportedly dislike these lizards (water monitors) because they eat dirty things. Avoid touching them casually.*

#### 12:00 Return to the hotel to pick up luggage and head to the airport

The flight is at 15:20, so we need to leave by noon. It takes about an hour to get from the city to the airport.

> *👉👉👉You can refer to KKday airport transfer services:*

Starting from the hotel, Grab fare: THB 577, highway toll applies; the driver will pay the toll first, and the toll fee will be added to the final Grab card payment. (I recall it was around THB 50)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ENH0G1_tBNWy-8RHV9XCag.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*eTEGYVJWr25O5A2Jkjgqiw.jpeg)

After exiting immigration around 13:20, the security at Bangkok airport is quite strict. Everything must go through security screening, and almost all carry-on luggage needs to be opened for manual inspection.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7IrLBQONyc2Y0APyRYH9wQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*QLYTVQ2GpR2u9JpE6XeekA.jpeg)

After passing through immigration and security, there was about an hour left to eat; I found a Thai restaurant and had my last meal in Thailand. (Seafood fried rice, mango juice, mango sticky rice).

> *After leaving the country, many shops sell mango sticky rice in takeout boxes, so you can buy some to eat on the plane if you're still hungry!*

> ***(⚠️But remember, strictly prohibited to bring back to Taiwan⚠️)***

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ouwulscC2q0OsIujIa2iXg.jpeg)

This bottle of water deserves a close-up because budget airlines don’t provide anything. I thought about buying water at the airport to drink on the plane, but after security, bottled water costs between THB 70 and 100, and this one is THB 100.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*rOoff9qAZL6L4LjXH4DNfw.jpeg)

BKK is huge… full of Trip.com ads. The return flight was on time, so I took the shuttle to the airport right away.

#### Back to Taiwan

Arriving at TPE Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, after picking up your luggage around 20:45, take the `1841` or `1819` Kuokuang Bus directly back to Taipei. It's very convenient without any transfers~

### ⚠️Travel Safety and Precautions in Bangkok, Thailand⚠️

The most important thing when going out is safety. Here is a summary of safety tips and precautions.

#### Fraud and Scam Prevention

[![The Eight Most Common Scams in Thailand Travel, Some Still Trap People Today!](/assets/b7e7c0938985/07b5_hqdefault.jpg "The Eight Most Common Scams in Thailand Travel, Some Still Trap People Today!")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o42r-bg16Fg){:target="_blank"}

The following summary is based on a video by Bangkok Cat. This time, I really encountered the currency exchange scam mentioned.

1. Miscalculating the bill  
   It’s not always intentional; you might miscalculate the total amount when ordering.

2. Approaching you first to ask about your country's currency or exchanging money  
   When you take out your wallet, they may steal, pickpocket, or snatch it away.

3. Outside the Grand Palace or attractions, they falsely claim the site is closed and eagerly suggest you take a tuk-tuk to other places (black temples/black shops/**this time at the pier, we encountered private tour boats that are black boats**) to scam you.

4. Tuk-tuks shouting prices everywhere, suddenly raising fares halfway  
   If you want to try tuk-tuks but fear being overcharged, [you can try the new MUVMI app, a tuk-tuk booking app](https://bkk.com.tw/muvmi-app/){:target="_blank"}  
   Even seemingly reliable tuk-tuks require caution against scams, such as overly eager drivers offering to take you to attractions or boat rides.

5. Fake staff: While waiting in line, fake staff will eagerly invite you inside.  
   They will introduce dishes in your language, help you order, then say you need to pay first. After taking the money, they run away.

6. Motorbike Rental Scams  
   Do not leave your passport as collateral, do not leave your passport as collateral, do not leave your passport as collateral.  
   If you face malicious claims of damage requiring compensation, leaving your passport will cause trouble.  
   Choose large chain rental companies and record a video of the vehicle’s condition before renting.

7. Local Dating App Scams  
   You might encounter transgender individuals, honey traps, or scammers.

8. The Papong Ping Pong Show scam involves enthusiastic street touts asking if you want to see the ping pong show. They say you only need to buy a 100 THB drink, then lead you into a dark alley or a second-floor black shop.  
   The show is terrible, and when you try to leave, they demand 3,000 THB, claiming the 100 THB price never existed.

9. Be careful of pickpockets in crowded places, even at ticketed entrances (e.g., Grand Palace, Wat Pho).

#### 🌿🚬

It will be banned next year, but I can share some experience.

- **⚠️⚠️⚠️Edibles (like gummies) have a strong effect, and the scary part is that when you eat them, they feel just like regular gummies with no sensation, but a few hours later, the effects suddenly kick in⚠️⚠️⚠️**

- It's best to try gradually: eat 1/3 and wait a few hours. If no issues, eat 2/3 and wait a few hours. If you feel something, then try taking one whole pill...

- Choosing based on your body type is best done gradually.

- **⚠️⚠️⚠️ Strongly recommend trying only inside the hotel. If you feel dizzy, rest immediately for safety ⚠️⚠️⚠️**

- Being able to drink alcohol does not mean you have a higher tolerance.

- **⚠️⚠️⚠️** Heart rate may increase and cause discomfort **⚠️⚠️⚠️**

- There needs to be someone awake to take care of things, which is safer.

- Smoking is only allowed on specific occasions.

#### Others

- Thailand is not a tipping culture country, so generally you don't need to tip; I only give a THB 20 tip for massages as a small gesture.

- Alcohol sales are only allowed from 11:00 to 14:00 and 17:00 to 24:00. Alcohol sales are prohibited all day on Buddhist holidays.

- Hotel balconies do not always allow smoking; you need to ask.

- Emergency Hotline for Foreigners in Foreign Languages: Dial `1155`

- SuperRich has business hours, so if you arrive too early or too late, you won't be able to exchange money.

I didn’t take many hotel photos, just one shocking picture I took in the morning when I woke up and found a giant millipede in my blanket.

### Day 2

#### [Santorini Park Greek-style Town](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5e56XAK4en27bHbPA){:target="_blank"} (Closed)

[**[Hua Hin Cha-am Attractions] Santorini Park: A Highly Photogenic Little Greece in Thailand \| BringYou**](https://www.bring-you.info/zh-tw/santorini-park){:target="_blank"}  
[*On the way from Bangkok to Hua Hin, in the Cha-am area, there is a Greek-style "Santorini Park." It is a popular weekend spot for Thai families to relax and stroll. If you love photography, this romantic park is highly recommended.* www.bring-you.info](https://www.bring-you.info/zh-tw/santorini-park){:target="_blank"}

It seems like a small amusement park combined with a department store, featuring Greek-themed scenery.

#### [Hua Hin Artist Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UcF7Wd82aHq4aGP86){:target="_blank"}

A fairly famous attraction, still open in 2024.

There are many paintings and artworks.

#### Return to Sheraton Hotel to Enjoy Facilities and the Beach

The hotel is in a villa style, with each room being a standalone unit. The swimming pool surrounds every room in the hotel, and there is a bar next to the pool. The beach outside is an undeveloped area, completely barren.

After dinner, order from the buffet and stroll around the nearby night market.

### Day 3

#### [Maeklong Railway Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Jsbm5FFwYf2ArEW36){:target="_blank"}

It's too early, everyone gave up and didn't go.

#### [Damnoen Saduak Floating Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tKSTmHgaHc4YCbpZ6){:target="_blank"}

It felt quite thrilling and adventurous, even though the water was murky and had a smell.

The tour guide specifically told the shop not to do back stepping. I only remember it felt very high-end, but pressing on the sides was painful and kept me awake XD

#### [River City Shopping Complex](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L3Pnv1BpLCpcGs7G7){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7tYE57IoZUXg1gQhWuSa8g.jpeg)

Since we are going on the Chao Phraya Princess Cruise with a buffet dinner tonight, we first visited the department store near the pier.

The food was okay, but the main highlight was the beautiful night view, where you can see the lights of the Bangkok [Riverside Night Market Ferris Wheel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/evFHo6ciFY4jswSt9){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6pzhTRcjRh_b6Z4jOJH_fg.jpeg)

After returning to the hotel, I had a few drinks at the bar upstairs in the Marriott. I only remember the beautiful night view and the cheap drinks.

### Day 4 Free Day

Only remember visiting department stores, Big C, and Central World.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*SpSAMDAk7Pp7SSCrmCyBQQ.jpeg)

That sums up the memories of the 2018 staff trip. This time, a fully independent trip back to Bangkok made me more familiar with the city. Compared to before, I feel it is more bustling, the food is better, and prices have increased.
