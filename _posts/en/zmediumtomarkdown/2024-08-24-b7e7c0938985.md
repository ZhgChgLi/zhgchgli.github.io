### \[Travel Diary\] 2024 Bangkok, Thailand 🇹🇭 5-Day Free Trip

Returning to Thailand after the pandemic for a quick five-day trip to Bangkok.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*kRZZjY_7_6WaKRkw9E74iw.jpeg)

#### Memories of Bangkok

Let's rewind to 2018, my first job's employee trip, and my first time traveling abroad, which was to Bangkok, Thailand (5 days); the following year in 2019, I went to Sabah with the company again; then came the two years stolen by the pandemic, and after it ended, I went crazy with trips to Japan.

Back then, I was a complete novice with zero social experience, blindly following my older siblings on outings. I didn't even know what I could or couldn't bring on a plane. At security, I foolishly placed my passport in the basket, only to realize it had fallen onto the conveyor belt when I exited the machine, nearly giving me a heart attack (if it had fallen into a gap, I wouldn't have been able to return). That trip was a mindless group tour, and my impressions of Bangkok were not very clear; I only remembered that the rooftop bars were great, the weather was hot, things were cheap, and massages were affordable—nothing more, and I had no concept of the geography.

Thus, I always thought about returning to Bangkok to revisit old memories from six years ago. However, being unfamiliar with Southeast Asia, I was hesitant to travel alone. **It just so happened that at the beginning of the year, while chatting with colleagues from Pinkoi, we decided to plan this five-day free trip to Bangkok.**

> _The details and fragments of memories from the 2018 Bangkok + Hua Xin five-day trip are included in the appendix at the end of this article._

Since I started a new job in June, I wasn't really focused on fun, and mainly Mark and Sean were responsible for the arrangements and planning; I didn't do much research.

#### Internet

This time, the preparation was rushed; I hadn't set up the internet the day before and didn't have time to buy my usual physical SIM card, so I decided to try eSIM for the first time. \(I fell in love with it right away\)

I bought the [**Thailand SIM Card | AIS 5G High-Speed Internet 8 Days Unlimited Data + Calls eSIM**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} directly on KKday, and after purchasing, I received the eSIM activation certificate immediately, allowing me to use it right away.

[Thailand SIM Card | AIS 5G High-Speed Internet 8 Days Unlimited Data + Calls eSIM](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}
- Limited-time promotional offer: From now until December 31, 2024, activating during the promotional period allows you to enjoy high-speed data of 15GB doubled to 30GB. After exceeding 30GB, the speed will drop to 384 Kbps, but you will remain connected.
- Unlimited calls within the AIS network, with a 50 THB call allowance. When using the following apps to send text messages, you can use an additional 10GB of data (10Mbps): TikTok, WeChat, and Instagram.
- **Has a physical number, can make calls, and receive SMS!**
- Days are calculated on a 24-hour basis, starting from the eSIM activation; 24 hours counts as one day (Thailand time).

[It's mainly all-you-can-eat and cheaper than a physical SIM card, 8 days for NT $232.](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}
#### Flight 🛫
- Outbound: TPE 16:00 -> BKK 18:45
- Return: BKK 15:20 -> TPE 20:10

Airline: Thai VietJet Air (Low-cost airline)

Price: `TWD $9,259` (including an additional **15 kg** checked baggage)

Initially, I thought about traveling with everyone, and my friends didn't check in luggage (ticket prices were around `$6,000`), but later I checked other airlines and felt I missed out; other airlines for similar times were around `$10,000`, not much difference, but much more comfortable!

Thai VietJet Air's baggage policy actually allows you not to check in luggage; you can carry two pieces of hand luggage with a total weight not exceeding 7 kg.
```
1. Hand luggage weight:
Each passenger (except infants) can bring 1 piece of their own luggage and 1 small hand luggage, with a maximum total weight not exceeding 7 kg.

2. Hand luggage dimensions:
- 01 piece with maximum dimensions of 56cm x 36cm x 23cm.
- 01 small hand luggage (including the following bags):
  + 01 bag for girls, magazines, cameras, bags for baby food, and bags purchased at the airport not exceeding 30cm x 20cm x 10cm.
  + 01 bag for outerwear that, when opened, does not exceed 114cm x 60cm x 11cm.
  + 01 bag for a laptop with maximum dimensions of 40cm x 30cm x 10cm.
```

> [_Information as of 2024/08/22, everything is subject to the latest official announcements._](https://www.vietjetair.com/zh-TW/pages/%E8%A1%8C%E6%9D%8E%E8%A6%8F%E5%AE%9A-1607068164219){:target="_blank"}

Basically, just carry a backpack and drag a carry-on suitcase.
#### 8/1 Flight Change Notification

### 8/02 Day 1 Departure
#### Departing from home around 12:30 PM

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*YsFObRlulrMFKHySvo3NAw.jpeg)

> _Remember to take the direct train to the airport; the regular train won't get you there faster, even if it's the morning train!_

#### Arriving at Taoyuan Airport Terminal 1 around 13:30

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*BBE4RhKU9tcJI427_LoQMw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ksagRFmStL9nLBWIyYY3Jg.png)

There was no one at the check-in counter, so I checked in and completed the baggage drop-off right away.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GI5u8vhrNRbFdG-XqY_2LQ.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*CBOJ0KHI4dMmAP5REh1UaA.jpeg)

Once again at B1R, the farthest gate that requires a shuttle bus.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XMQJOe1n5vyVdWQrYJpgNg.png)

With plenty of time before the 4 PM flight, I decided to grab some food at 鼎呱呱 (Ding Guagua). This time I discovered I could order just the guagua bun, which they previously only sold with fried chicken!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*hfpWAbwiM2Aal3MZJ36oOA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XNjYtycibxeowQBaDT_jNw.jpeg)

I also realized that if you walk straight from 鼎呱呱, you can reach Terminal 2, so if you have time, you can go there to eat; or you can go from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1 for the free VIP lounge XD.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t4dk8GQIv0D53N0V_qo7KA.png)

After finishing my meal, I went to the free VIP lounge in Terminal 1 to relax and eat. This time I saw someone charging their device; [last time, all the outlets were taken, but it seems they have fixed it](../cb65fd5ab770/) (?). 
#### Around 15:30, heading to B1R boarding area

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*2Ros8CQBKj0-kkMugSZ7Hg.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*At7elbjIueB9lvvenvlfTA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*fpzrwzWez_HwgKFuFmDAhA.png)

I don't know if it's because it's a low-cost airline, but the information wasn't updated (it kept showing 16:00, but it had actually changed to 16:35).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*puKndBRQgCKs3LKbXbzEWw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*zCT2uidCELNc7WL1NpW72Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1aGwmjed9srQtHli3uDoxg.jpeg)

With the flight delayed, the actual departure time was 17:13.
- VietJet's seats are about the same size as Tigerair's, larger than Peach Aviation, but the seats are uncomfortable; the leather material is not breathable, and sitting for too long can be painful.
- VietJet seems to allow you to bring your own food; on the return trip, someone was eating mango sticky rice on board without any issues.

#### 19:30 Arrive at Bangkok BKK Suvarnabhumi Airport

I heard from my colleagues that if you arrive at Bangkok Airport during peak hours, you can purchase the [**Thailand Airport BKK Departure Meet and Greet Fast Track Service**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/160605?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} for quick customs clearance XD. However, since we arrived at this time, there were almost only people from the same flight, so the customs process was very quick.
#### 20:00 Collect luggage and exit the airport

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*QDvOtf4PsS-jSESOkb-0AA.jpeg)

Perhaps due to the low-cost airline, there weren't many people checking in luggage, and we got our bags super fast.
#### eSIM Network Setup

As soon as I exited the airport, I started figuring out how to set up and activate the eSIM, only to realize…

> **_⚠️ Activating eSIM requires an internet connection ⚠️_** 

> **_⚠️ Activating eSIM requires an internet connection ⚠️_** 

> **_⚠️ Activating eSIM requires an internet connection ⚠️_** 

It's a bit like buying a pair of scissors but needing another pair to cut open the packaging; activating the eSIM requires an internet connection to enable it. Fortunately, a friend traveling with me had already activated his eSIM in Taiwan, so I borrowed his internet to activate mine. \(The airport also has Wi-Fi available, so there's no need to worry too much\)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*_xv7JB_yl7d47ljrUTpYdw.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6vg_zfmf6tr3SIBUj6gi4A.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7-7yMcMgwbpNzBq1YgknaQ.png)

To find the eSIM activation, simply long-press the QR code and select "Add eSIM."

> **_I don't know why, but if you save the QR code to photos or notes, you lose the quick add feature. Another method is to send the QR code to a travel companion or print it out for your phone to scan._**

iPhone iOS eSIM manual setup path: Settings \-> Cellular \-> Add eSIM \-> Scan QR Code \-> Manually enter information \-> Input the information from the email \-> Use as... You can select "Travel" \-> Choose "Travel" for mobile data \-> Done!

Once activated, it’s like having dual SIMs, but the original SIM card has no internet unless you purchase a roaming plan. **In case of emergency, you can switch back to the original SIM card number!**
- [For AIS, dial \*545\# to check your phone number, \*121\# to check your balance, and \*121\*3\# to check your data](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}

#### 20:30 Finding Food at the Airport

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*mDPRItCdp28u5P6tTQelqQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*bgHNI9p20Jyf3t3IMDExMQ.jpeg)

Since it takes over an hour to get to the city and the hotel, and the low-cost airline doesn’t provide meals, everyone was quite hungry, so we decided to grab dinner at the airport.

We found a Thai restaurant and ordered some food; the spicy minced pork was really hot and refreshing, and the vegetable soup helped ease the spiciness.
#### 21:00 Moving to the Hotel

> _👉👉👉 You can refer to KKday's airport transfer service:_ 

> _[\- Thailand | Airport Car Transfer | Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) / Don Mueang Airport (DMK) — Bangkok/Pattaya/Hua Hin City Hotels](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/3431-bkk-or-dmk-bangkok-private-transfer?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*cagHOMc-TKS9fmhN18zVOQ.png)

After eating, around 21:00, we started moving towards the city and the hotel.

**Taking public transport requires three transfers on the subway and BTS:**
1. Airport Rail Link `Suvarnabhumi` \-> `Phaya Thai`
2. BTS Sukhumvit Line `Phaya Thai` \-> `Siam`
3. BTS Silom Line `Siam` \-> `Chong Nonsi`

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OvL8K9OxwjMCVJ-3hYy2bw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*-eJ_rrYns2teWCITXTnhTA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*PeWlfQ6fd55mU1Ojk0isJQ.png)

- The Airport Rail Link only allows ticket purchases.
- BTS tickets can be purchased at the ticket window for the Rabbit Card (BTS transportation card) for top-ups and entry/exit.
- Please note that **the Rabbit Card can only be used on BTS**, not on MRT or the Airport Rail Link.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*EF3IK_FXS4n3igDOsJ0C4A.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*jY4Jg6_vGhAM5CjPrVM-Iw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Dom8OdbMSRAAXtFpykCTZQ.png)

- Arrived at `Chong Nonsi` \(later I found out that the King Power MahaNakhon Building is at this station!\)

#### Walk to [JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL](https://jckevin.com/){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6VrvZBTlo2gjg_lY7oQG8w.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*cgv3HGHsAkH8WL_jA6qTsg.jpeg)

When exiting the BTS, don’t rush down the overpass; you can walk across the road from the overpass.

> **_I felt it was quite dark along the way \(not many streetlights\), and it was quite a distance \(15 mins / 1 KM\). If walking alone at night, it can be quite scary._** _Along the way, you will pass a 7–11 and a small night market, where I bought some snacks to take back to the hotel._ 

> _Also, if taking a taxi, due to the two-way road and U-turn issues, the driver has to go a bit past the hotel to the next gap to turn back, which is a bit troublesome._ 

#### 10:30 Arrive at JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL

Arrived at the hotel around 10:30.

[![JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL](/assets/b7e7c0938985/43d8_hqdefault.jpg "JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg24V_VS6oA){:target="_blank"}

The room is very spacious, like a whole apartment, with a master bedroom, a secondary bedroom, two bathrooms, a kitchen, a living room, and a balcony.
#### 2018 Memories

What a coincidence! During the group employee trip to Bangkok in 2018, everyone took a taxi to the rooftop bar at this hotel XD.

Additionally, they also offer a Sky Bar dinner package:

#### 2024

Since I’m staying here, after dropping off my luggage in the room, I ran up to take a look.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*h8ksUQqToXHPTda_RnwkSg.jpeg)

Since it was already past dinner time, I could only order some snacks and skewers.
### 8/03 Day 2 Wat Pho, Grand Palace, Wat Phra Kaew, Wat Arun, ICONSIAM, Lhao Lhao, Rock Pub Live
#### Hotel Breakfast

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7m7nqO5Q1kdTTPQsdx9TWg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t1xva8yggECe94znx32pew.jpeg)

After having breakfast at the hotel in the morning, we headed out. I thought the breakfast was okay, but there weren't many options.
#### 9:30 Departure

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*A2zezLiqIEOngnuebgxUjA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dZQvSlCNcBjgE4-mdnFZMQ.jpeg)

Since there were many of us, we took a Grab \(THB 135\) directly to Wat Pho.

On the way, we passed through [Chinatown](https://www.kkday.com/zh-hk/blog/101689/bangkokchinatown?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}, but I forgot to take a photo; it had a very cyberpunk vibe!

You need to take off your shoes to enter, and you can walk around the Reclining Buddha to pay your respects.
#### SuperRich Currency Exchange

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GKVidaEFygfEMNjfKFNweA.jpeg)

After leaving Wat Pho, I thought I would first solve the currency exchange issue. Only one friend in the group had exchanged some Thai Baht in advance; the others thought they would exchange in Bangkok. So after exiting, we walked to the nearby [The Old Siam Shopping Plaza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UPNxgoTmtswuhHVS8){:target="_blank"} to exchange money at SuperRich.

**⚠️ Please note: The Taiwanese dollars you want to exchange must not have stains, markings, etc., otherwise they will be rejected for exchange. \(I happened to have a thousand-dollar bill from an ATM in Taiwan that had a pencil mark on it and was rejected for exchange\)**

> _NTD $5,000 exchanged for THB $5,200_

Khanom bueang Thai Pancake

After exchanging money, I had cash, so I replenished my energy at the food market on the first floor; I had a sweet Thai pancake \(ขนมเบื้อง\) filled with meringue that tasted very sweet, like cotton candy, and also had a banana pancake; finally, I bought an iced coffee to continue on my way.
#### Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew

Entrance fee: THB 500/person.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*NVu8tXAG7D3sGNRQi-PHGw.jpeg)

Around 13:00, after exiting the Grand Palace, we found a Western restaurant nearby towards the pier to have lunch.
#### 14:00 Preparing to Take the Boat to Wat Arun

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ePMFJ1jf5orPQRQTEJHMnQ.jpeg)

> **_⚠️ There will be people outside the pier trying to solicit you; be careful as they are private boat operators, charging high fees \(THB 500, 1000\) and are not safe; just ignore them and find the official pier and tell them where you want to go. ⚠️_** 

> **_The official ticket price is only THB 30 \(_** _`Tha Chang` **to Wat Arun\), and the new boats have air conditioning, making them safe and comfortable.**_ 

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*oc8bbW-4ZZwQeFkqNhXwNw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ccUJ7WKGfb73k8UWEDNesg.jpeg)

When the boat arrives, the staff will announce "Wat Arun" \(yes, in Chinese\), and you can ask anytime if you're unsure.

The time is approaching afternoon, and a thunderstorm is on the way; you can see the water flowing muddy and turbulent.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8hMHmiUOANTISYOVpTISiA.jpeg)

The boat is quite new, the air conditioning is cool, it's very safe and enclosed, and there are plenty of departures, making it very convenient!

Upon arrival, the staff will also announce "Wat Arun."

#### 14:30 Arrive at Wat Arun

Ticket price: THB 200

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ujWr_UkXTX__M2jEz06sUw.jpeg)

After disembarking, you will be at Wat Arun, where you can directly queue to buy tickets for entry.

> **_⚠️ Wat Arun also has a dress code ⚠️_** 

> **_No exposed shoulders, shorts, midriffs, or short skirts._** 

> **_You can wear traditional Thai clothing; many people wear it for photos._**

You can walk to the middle platform for photos \(⚠️ The stairs are steep, so be careful\). Many people also change into traditional Thai clothing to take commemorative photos here.

After the visit, return to the pier and find the ticket booth \(PIER 2\) to buy a ticket to ICONSIAM \(THB 40\), then head to PIER 1 to board.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*MbiMV91xnwXQqSTg4UUx1g.jpeg)

ICONSIAM is large and looks luxurious, with a very unique food court on the first floor.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*eLZgR_Wmmnt0oWkwO-d-KQ.jpeg)

I bought a cup of ChaTraMue hand-brewed Thai milk tea to recharge.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*P-p65azTMpWowyRbZuyxhQ.png)

I strolled all the way to the BTS Charoen Nakhon platform, thinking of getting a foot massage for an hour.

There was a newer, larger place outside \(1\) THAI GARDEN MASSAGE, but they were fully booked; fortunately, I continued walking to \(2\) another massage shop, as shown in the picture; I found it very comfortable, less crowded, spacious, and quieter, with affordable rates \(foot/1 hour/THB 270\).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*s6--mVkXnO3wqrcTHRgL0Q.png)

After the massage, I had the energy to continue shopping, returning to ICONSIAM; I walked all the way to the upstairs restaurant, which was also quite extravagant, featuring a jungle, small bridges, and waterfalls, overall very nice!

> _I bought the famous Japanese fries, TORO FRIES \(the line was long\) to recharge._ 

> _They also have % coffee from Japan here._ 

#### Heading to LHAO LHAO for dinner

This line is a branch with only three stations and less frequent service.

> _Google Maps seems to lack information about this BTS line; it suggested I walk to Krung Thon Buri._ 

From here, taking one stop to Krung Thon Buri connects to the Silom Line.

At Siam, I switched to the Sukhumvit Line and got off at Ari Station, which is just a short walk to LHAO LHAO restaurant.
#### 19:00 [LHAO LHAO](https://bkk.com.tw/2012-12-12-186/#LHAO_LHAO_%E7%A8%80%E9%A3%AF%EF%BC%88%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%95%E0%B9%8C%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%95%E0%B9%8A%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B8%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%87%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B2%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B2%EF%BC%89){:target="_blank"}

The owner seems to be Chinese? It feels like a fusion of Chinese and Thai cuisine, a highly-rated old restaurant, and apparently a favorite of Blackpink's LISA.

Since I was going to a pub to listen to live music later, I ate a bit hurriedly, but I found every dish delicious!!
- In the first three images, the background of the "Goose Brand Cooling Balm," the dish that looks like minced meat, is called หมูสับผัดหนำเลี้ยบ, which seems to be stir-fried minced meat with pickled olives? It goes very well with rice!
- In the second image, the fried oyster omelet, similar to the fried oyster omelet from Taiwan's Shilin Night Market.
- In the second image, the seasonal limited drink, longan tea.
- In the second image, the most special dish, crab curry \(Panang Curry\), made with a whole fresh crab.

> _The Goose Brand Cooling Balm recommended by Thais; I later bought a jar that smells smoother than a menthol nasal stick and has less nasal irritation!_ 

#### 20:00 [The Rock Pub](https://www.instagram.com/therockpub/){:target="_blank"}

All four performances were rock and classic old songs!

I recognized songs from: Coldplay, Radiohead, Kings of Leon, Arcade Fire, Oasis, The Killers…

Cat magnet, Bangkok has many cats that immediately come to rub against me.

I took a Grab to [Wang Chun Sheng Beef Hotpot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1VuwzAdKS4vH6kmj6){:target="_blank"} for breakfast. The overall flavor is quite Chinese/Taiwanese, which I think is good, but Tainan beef soup is even better.

> _After eating, I headed to Chatuchak Market, which is a bit far, so I didn't want to walk and transfer to BTS; I took an Uber instead \(THB 374\)._

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*0ofswmspB9w2vM7mII57_g.jpeg)

Chatuchak is large, with dense vendors, but overall it is clean and easy to navigate. However, many items are repetitive, and it seems like a lot of them are touristy Made In China products.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GJv4mk3v2-DptRofTF_9zg.jpeg)

In the end, I only bought a Thai brand, Phutawan indoor diffuser, as a souvenir.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*28EbS8N3OUJwSCPrgaTb8Q.png)

Feeling tired from shopping, I walked into a massage shop inside for a foot massage + some shoulder and neck massage. \(1 hour/THB 250\)
#### Restroom

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*tGe2u5gIF70mPz3d7sX5XQ.jpeg)

If you need to use the restroom at Chatuchak, there are paid restrooms outside the market \(THB 5 per use\). I went in, and it was very clean, with one stall per person, and they are generally cleaned regularly; if you don't want to pay, you can go to the nearby [Mixt Chatuchak](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5PwQcFThBHtFpbzw6){:target="_blank"} mall, which has free and equally clean restrooms.

After eating, I continued to shop and bought a cup of durian juice to drink, which had a rich and authentic flavor and was reasonably priced \(THB 89\).

> _Later, I found that things at Chatuchak are actually cheaper; for example, the menthol nasal sticks are sold here for 6 pieces at $99, while Big C sells them for 6 pieces at $140… and the durian juice is also cheaper; it sells for over $140 at night markets in the city._ 

#### 15:00 Take BTS to King Power Mahanakhon

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*A4V3CL5XvLoQ4sp487pJuQ.jpeg)

Chatuchak is closer to the MRT, but the King Power Mahanakhon we are going to is at BTS Chong Nonsi station; it takes about 1 KM \(15 mins\) to walk from Chatuchak to the nearest BTS Saphan Khwai station.
#### King Power Mahanakhon (Bangkok's King Power Mahanakhon)

Ticket price: THB 1,080 per person

Up close, it doesn't seem as towering as imagined, but the architectural style is quite unique, resembling a cyberpunk aesthetic.

Upon entering, you must go through a security check, and after purchasing tickets, you can store your belongings for free; backpacks cannot be taken up \(small waist bags are allowed\).

_Free digital photos; after the visit, staff will guide you on how to download them._

The direct elevator has a 360-degree scene animation, similar to Taipei 101 and the Tokyo Skytree; the height is roughly comparable to Tokyo Tower.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*sP_hQ4hGSKCygeaSgltHpQ.jpeg)

The elevator first takes you to the indoor observation deck on the 74th floor, where there is a café and public seating for a short rest. To reach the outdoor observation deck on the 78th floor, you need to transfer to another elevator or take the stairs.

As soon as you arrive on the 78th floor, there is a small bar where you can order a drink and enjoy the view.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*PeqjUWSwE1Hh24qWkioTxA.png)

After exiting the 78th floor, you can continue up to the stairs and the rooftop lounge area.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dFRAU2mY_Qp9T0ru4GngIg.jpeg)

From the rooftop, you can enjoy a panoramic view of Bangkok, and you can imagine how beautiful the night view must be!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*f4eREu0dL79OzsYCtl1O9A.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XOsqBu8PjCeB7XSlsD0_Fg.jpeg)

The stairs and rooftop lounge area face the famous transparent glass corridor, where you can see straight down to the ground. You can grab shoe covers from the nearby box to enter, but **it is prohibited to bring your phone; you can ask your companions or staff for help with taking photos.**

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*K2MOcxsrNbuNbz00sPfNOg.png)

The entire glass corridor isn't very large, about the size of a rooftop infinity pool at a hotel. It doesn't feel very high when viewed from the side, but actually walking on it can be a bit scary, making your legs feel weak XD.

### Chatuchak Night Market (formerly Ratchada Train Night Market)

![You can swipe your credit card directly at the MRT](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*BrfghHaJknyt6IiX7yOgbA.jpeg)

You can swipe your credit card directly at the MRT.

To get to Central Rama 9, you need to transfer to the MRT subway at Pharam 9 Station. The Rabbit Card cannot be used here; you need to buy a ticket or you can now use a VISA card to swipe in and out.

> _I tested the Taishin GoGo card, and it works; I haven't tried the Cathay Cube._

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*c6Ug9F-JfXPzgnfvtvRvdg.jpeg)

For dinner, we came here to find food. I must say that Bangkok's night markets and markets are far superior to those in Taiwan. The overall environment is clean, with seating areas, and it’s well-organized, making it very comfortable to stroll around.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1cBlgC7kvmt1fWeMfiDVMA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OVMfzMU1HugpE0CVyUiSVw.jpeg)

After browsing around, we first tried the dessert on the left (similar to egg cake?) and the savory seafood grill on the right. Both were chewy and quite good.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*31mIDWp4WgTX8TSK5Q-C4Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*K3ZN-Kiwz4yTiNHiZ3P1bg.jpeg)

Next was the main event: volcanic ribs, which had a very unique flavor. The sauce was a spicy lemongrass flavor, and you can just put on gloves and eat it with your hands—very appetizing!

After eating, we bought coconut ice cream + mango + peanut dessert from other stalls, which was also delicious!

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GamIzqKB9ROnECRfhPfA1Q.jpeg)

After eating, we strolled around Central Rama 9, where there is also the famous NaRaYa Bangkok bag.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*a5BcYS64yitoccK9TTU1HQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*csaO0X3lGf2TSIb3xQ8JWg.jpeg)

On the way back to the hotel, we happened to encounter Bangkok after the rain, combined with colorful digital advertising screens. The color contrast was striking, giving off a cyberpunk vibe.

#### 7-Eleven Hot Pressed Toast Late Night Snack

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*xQi9q1iA7o6FyfAeEISTEw.jpeg)

On the way back to the hotel, I tried Thailand's [hot pressed toast from convenience stores](https://supertaste.tvbs.com.tw/pack/347495){:target="_blank"} along with Thai banana milk. The filling was melted cheese with a hot dog, and the crust was flaky! It was really delicious and cheap!

### 8/05 Day 4 Central World, Big C, Terminal 21

> **_Didn’t sleep well all night + hungover all day, feeling dazed._**

#### Central World

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8pZ3crfkb4wIqZZOoI9-zA.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6_evilQk4T0LdCYSIgBudg.jpeg)

In the morning, I got up and headed out to shop at Central World.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Sp3TTqnEx3yn6IM4H38NsQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*tmLvijY5Q7TVJbMo4D4XFg.jpeg)

On the first floor, there is a SHAKE SHACK burger. I ordered the SHAKE SHACK signature burger and the coconut milkshake flavor that is unique to Bangkok. The burger was delicious and not greasy, but I found the milkshake a bit too sweet.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OXOp4dN-5p9xS1ojcu0b9A.jpeg)

The place is quite large, and like ICONSIAM, if you want to explore thoroughly, it can take a long time… I just did a quick browse and bought a shirt.

#### Big C

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*JNswfx_h01UuffS299HjgQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GWD-HcYbLfAQEAN99tErsw.jpeg)

After shopping at Central World, I walked across to Big C to buy snacks and souvenirs. (There are many options, but I didn’t find them cheaper…)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Bda3BGHI_ZeylIS96UNcWg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*DWtvvjZ3iAwk5U3MPZDudg.jpeg)

![Bottom left Phutawan indoor diffuser was bought yesterday at Chatuchak, but I guess it’s also available in department stores in the city.](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*aMillKlyevVx8fDncaurSA.png)

The bottom left Phutawan indoor diffuser was bought yesterday at Chatuchak, but I guess it’s also available in department stores in the city.

Additionally, Big C seems to no longer provide plastic bags, so you need to buy an eco-bag in the store.

> _That durian chips bag is big, but when you open it, there are actually only two small bags inside… but it’s quite tasty._

#### Lunch

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*z4VW1WOelH7UjBco9PIAqg.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*qWWrZXa_LRClqCTi7bZK3Q.png)

There was a food market event in the outdoor plaza of Central World. It’s not just a simple setup with tents and stalls; it has a theme, and this time the theme was Titanic. You can enter for free by following their official YouTube channel; the decorations inside were also very exquisite.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*9iurlEySgDL-ZQZzVGDiug.jpeg)

But for lunch, we went back to SHAKE SHACK again, this time trying the chicken thigh burger, which was just as delicious.

#### Afternoon: Returned to the hotel for a nap because I didn’t sleep well + hungover… I was really tired.

#### Dinner at Terminal 21 Shopping Mall

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8_lDD7yaIYIq7HV4zG4ClA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1T7njk_JYMi1eP1oMbjH-w.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*giNbQ1GPda-qPFaA8yQ7sQ.jpeg)

Terminal 21 is also a place where you can never finish exploring. Each floor has a different regional theme; for example, the Japan floor mainly sells Japanese products and restaurants.

I mainly met up with [Chun-Hsiu Liu](https://medium.com/u/72361fccaa43){:target="_blank"} at the food street upstairs for a meal. ( **A cheap and delicious dining spot that I highly recommend!** )

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ZyuBXqyjZtLw5zyVmarw6w.png)

At the food street, you just find a seat to sit; many locals also come here to eat.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*a4MnqcM5Bi9jRPC3T29s5A.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*sYc87mPtI1nf3-9pk_F13w.png)

> _⚠️ **The payment method here is that the vendors do not collect money directly. You need to go to the counter to exchange cash for a food card, and use the food card QR code to pay; after eating, return to the counter for a refund. (No deposit or handling fee required)**_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*rt81B-Pc31OZeMlgG5M38Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*k1vmadbwhdJsJNmkllarLQ.jpeg)

There are many choices; just line up, tell them your number, and use the food card QR code to pay; you can also take out (I remember there’s an additional THB 10 packaging fee).

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Ol8uiQNEnE9tuZc-qbgqgQ.jpeg)

I ordered seafood fried instant noodles (THB 50) + pork chop with fries (THB 59) = THB 109.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t2R762mSI8CeoDWpSAuEKg.jpeg)

After eating, I also took a box of mango sticky rice as a late-night snack to eat back at the hotel.

It’s really delicious and cheap!!! A meal at a restaurant outside usually starts at THB 200–300, while here, most meals are around THB 50–80.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*G4G79vwVWj592tOApWbK2g.jpeg)

After eating, I went to the back to walk around [Benjakitti Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bmKhQpbw9KTtLYeN8){:target="_blank"} and look for the legendary [Bangkok Monitor Lizard](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%B7%A8%E8%9C%A5%E4%BD%94%E9%A0%98%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8-%E8%A2%AB%E5%B0%81%E6%B3%B0%E7%89%88%E4%BE%8F%E7%BE%8E%E5%9C%92-104942584.html){:target="_blank"}; perhaps because it was nighttime, I didn’t see a single one.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dMZhzj3rAqhRWAVuxeS0XQ.jpeg)

Back at the hotel, my travel companions bought mangosteen to taste. I found the fresh ones delicious, with a subtle sweetness combined with the flavor of the mangosteen, very smooth. Later, I tried dried mangosteen, but it didn’t taste as good; it was dry and sour.

> **_As for durians, the prices in Bangkok are not cheaper… a box is still THB 200 – 300._**

### 8/06 Day 5 Return Trip
#### Bangkok Monitor Lizard

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*E0M71hXTtQmzl2YP6kgPtw.jpeg)

In the morning, I was not giving up and specifically went to [Lumphini Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n53FhsjXUUJLnghn6){:target="_blank"} to look for the legendary Bangkok Monitor Lizard. Due to time constraints, I only found one medium-sized lizard that had just come out to bask in the sun.

> _Looking for the monitor lizard was just a personal whim of mine. It is said that locals really dislike these lizards (water monitors) because they eat dirty things, so it’s best not to touch them._

#### 12:00 Back to the hotel to pick up luggage and head to the airport

My flight is at 15:20, so I need to leave for the airport around noon. It takes about an hour from the city center to the airport.

From the hotel, the Grab fare was THB 577, which required taking the highway; the driver would pay the toll in advance, and the final Grab charge would include the toll fee. (I remember it was about THB 50.)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ENH0G1_tBNWy-8RHV9XCag.jpeg)

The checked baggage limit was only 15 kg, and I managed to stick to it.

After clearing immigration around 13:20, the security checks at Bangkok airport were quite strict; everything had to go through security, and carry-on bags were almost all opened for manual inspection.

After passing through immigration and security, I had about an hour to grab a bite to eat, so I found a Thai restaurant for my last meal in Thailand. \(Seafood fried rice, mango juice, mango sticky rice\).

> _Many shops sell mango sticky rice in takeout boxes after leaving the country, so if you don't have enough, you can buy some to eat on the plane!_

> _**\(⚠️ But remember, it's prohibited to bring it back to Taiwan ⚠️\)**_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ouwulscC2q0OsIujIa2iXg.jpeg)

I have to give this bottle of water a close-up because the budget airline didn't provide anything, and I thought I could buy water at the airport. However, after passing through immigration, bottled water costs THB 70 — 100, and this one was THB 100.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*rOoff9qAZL6L4LjXH4DNfw.jpeg)

BKK is huge... filled with Trip\.com advertisements. My return flight was on time, so I took the shuttle bus directly to the terminal.
#### Back to Taiwan

Arriving at TPE Taoyuan International Airport, I picked up my luggage and headed out around 20:45, directly taking the `1841` or `1819` Kuo-Kuang bus back to Taipei, which was very convenient without needing to transfer.
### ⚠️ Safety and Precautions for Traveling in Bangkok, Thailand ⚠️

The most important thing when going out is safety, so I've compiled a list of safety tips and precautions.
#### Scam Prevention

[![The Eight Most Common Scams When Traveling in Thailand, Some Still Catching Victims Today!](/assets/b7e7c0938985/07b5_hqdefault.jpg "The Eight Most Common Scams When Traveling in Thailand, Some Still Catching Victims Today!")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o42r-bg16Fg){:target="_blank"}

The following summary is based on a video by the Bangkok Cat. I actually encountered a currency exchange scam this time.
1. Incorrect calculations
   It may not be intentional; you can calculate the total amount when ordering.
2. Someone approaches you wanting to see your country's currency or asking if you want to exchange money.
   When you pull out your wallet, they might steal or pickpocket you.
3. Outside the Grand Palace or attractions, they falsely claim the site is closed and enthusiastically suggest taking a tuk-tuk to other places \(black temples/black shops/ **private boat rides, I encountered this at the pier**\) to scam you into spending.
4. Tuk-tuks often have inflated prices and may suddenly increase the fare halfway.
   If you want to experience a tuk-tuk but are afraid of being scammed, [you can try the new MUVMI app for tuk-tuk rides](https://bkk.com.tw/muvmi-app/){:target="_blank"}.
   Even with seemingly good tuk-tuks, be wary of scam #3, where they enthusiastically suggest attractions or boat rides.
5. Fake staff may enthusiastically lure you into their establishment while you're waiting in line.
   They will introduce the menu in your language, help you order, and then say you need to pay upfront, taking your money and running.
6. Motorcycle and scooter rental scams
   Do not leave your passport as a deposit, do not leave your passport as a deposit, do not leave your passport as a deposit.
   If you encounter malicious scams claiming damage and asking for compensation, leaving your passport can lead to trouble.
   It's better to rent from reputable chain rental companies, and always take a video of the vehicle's condition before renting.
7. Local dating app scams
   You might end up meeting a ladyboy, a scammer, or worse.
8. The Patpong ping pong show scam, where enthusiastic touts ask if you want to see a ping pong show, claiming you only need to buy a 100 THB drink, then take you into a dark alley or upstairs to a shady establishment.
   It's hard to leave, and when you try, they demand 3,000 THB, claiming the 100 THB deal doesn't exist.
9. Be cautious of pickpockets in crowded places, even in areas where you need to buy tickets to enter \(e.g., Grand Palace, Wat Pho\).

#### 🌿🚬

This will be banned next year, but I can share some experiences.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️ Edibles (like gummies) have a strong effect, and the scary part is that while eating, it feels just like regular gummies, and the effects can suddenly hit you a few hours later ⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- It's best to try gradually, eat 1/3, wait a few hours... if nothing happens, eat 2/3... wait a few hours... feel a bit, then try eating one whole piece...
- Smoking should also be gradual based on your tolerance.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️ Regardless, I strongly recommend trying it only in your hotel; if you feel out of it, you can rest directly, which is safer ⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- Just because you drink doesn't mean you have a higher tolerance.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️** Your heart rate may increase and feel uncomfortable **⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- It's safer to have someone awake to take care of you if needed.
- Only smoke in specific situations.

#### Other
- Thailand is not a tipping culture, so generally, you don't need to tip; I only leave a THB 20 tip for massages as a gesture.
- Alcohol can only be sold from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM and from 5:00 PM to midnight; it's prohibited all day on Buddhist holidays.
- Hotel balconies may not allow smoking, so it's best to ask.
- The emergency hotline for foreigners is `1155`.
- SuperRich has business hours, so if you arrive too early or too late, you won't be able to exchange money.

A colleague \(2024\) mentioned that Bangkok has many, many Instagram-worthy cafes, all quite extravagant. Friends interested can check them out; this one had low ratings and is now closed.

I didn't take many photos of the hotel; I only captured one morning shot when I woke up to find a giant centipede in my blanket, which was quite a shock.
### Day 2
#### [Santorini Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5e56XAK4en27bHbPA){:target="_blank"} \(Closed\)

[**【Hua Hin Seven Rock Attractions】Santorini Amusement Park: A Great Place for Photos in Thailand's Little Greece \| BringYou**](https://www.bring-you.info/zh-tw/santorini-park){:target="_blank"} 
[_On the way from Bangkok to Hua Hin, there's a Greek-themed "Santorini Amusement Park" in the Seven Rock area, a popular spot for Thai families to stroll on weekends. If you love taking photos, I highly recommend visiting this incredibly romantic park._ www\.bring\-you\.info](https://www.bring-you.info/zh-tw/santorini-park){:target="_blank"}

It seems to be a small amusement park with Greek-style scenery.
#### [Hua Hin Artist Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UcF7Wd82aHq4aGP86){:target="_blank"}

A well-known attraction that is still open in 2024.

There are many paintings and artworks.
#### Back to Sheraton Hotel to Enjoy Facilities and the Beach

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*448HsB-gg4LjZx0qBo-Fkw.jpeg)

The hotel is in a villa style, with each room being a standalone unit. The swimming pool surrounds all the rooms, and there's a bar by the pool; the beach outside is undeveloped and desolate.

After dinner, we went to a nearby night market.
### Day 3
#### [Maeklong Railway Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Jsbm5FFwYf2ArEW36){:target="_blank"}

It was too early, and everyone gave up on going.
#### [Damnoen Saduak Floating Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tKSTmHgaHc4YCbpZ6){:target="_blank"}

I remember it being quite thrilling and adventurous, even though the water was murky and had a smell.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*qy7YBGcWTMfpItXtapHr9g.jpeg)

The guide specifically told the staff not to step on my back. I remember it being very high-end, but it was painful, and I couldn't sleep XD.
#### [River City Shopping Complex](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L3Pnv1BpLCpcGs7G7){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7tYE57IoZUXg1gQhWuSa8g.jpeg)

Since we were going on the Chao Phraya Princess cruise + buffet dinner that night, we stopped by the nearby shopping mall to browse.
#### Chao Phraya Princess Cruise Buffet Dinner

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*EEELplqEfG3bLcGUoLAvRQ.jpeg)

I remember the food being decent, but the main highlight was the beautiful night view, where you could see the lights of the Bangkok [Riverside Night Market Ferris Wheel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/evFHo6ciFY4jswSt9){:target="_blank"}.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6pzhTRcjRh_b6Z4jOJH_fg.jpeg)

After returning to the hotel, we went to the bar on the Marriott rooftop for a drink. I only remember the beautiful night view and the cheap drinks.
### Day 4 Free Day

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*NU2LiyNLR8lgf7phtPYKHg.jpeg)

I only remember going shopping at the mall, Big C, and Central World.
#### In the evening, we went to [Zoom Sky Bar at Anantara Sathorn Bangkok Hotel](https://www.kkday.com/zh-hk/product/105589-zoom-sky-bar-anantara-sathorn-bangkok-package?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} for drinks.

### Day 5 Return Trip

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*SpSAMDAk7Pp7SSCrmCyBQQ.jpeg)

That's the memory of the 2018 employee trip. This time, returning to Bangkok for a fully free trip made me more familiar with the city. Compared to my previous impressions, I feel it has become more prosperous, the food is better, and prices have increased.
