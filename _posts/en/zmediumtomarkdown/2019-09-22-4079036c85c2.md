### What was the experience like at iPlayground 2019?

iPlayground 2019 Hot Participation Experience

### About the Event

Last year it was held in mid-October. I only started managing Medium to document my life in early October last year; combining the UUID topic I heard about and my participation experience, I also wrote an [article](../a4bc3bce7513/). This year, I continue to **write reflections to ride the trend**!

Compared to the first edition in 2018, this year has seen even greater improvements in all aspects!

**First, regarding the venue**, last year the event was held in the basement conference hall, which was small and felt cramped, making it difficult to use computers during lectures; this year, it was moved to the NTU Boya Hall, which is spacious, new, not crowded, and the classrooms have desks and power outlets, making it convenient to use personal computers!

**Agenda**: Besides prominent domestic speakers, this event also invites international guests to share; among them, the packed sessions with no doubt belong to Cat God [Wei Wang](https://medium.com/u/52b3ba2db3a){:target="_blank"}. This year also features workshops with hands-on teaching for the first time, but spots are limited—act fast… If you’re busy eating and chatting, you’ll miss out.

**Sponsor Booths and Ask the Speaker Area**  
The larger venue made networking easier and there were more activities; at the [iChef](https://www.ichefpos.com/zh-tw){:target="_blank"} booth [#iCHEFxiPlayground](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/ichefxiplayground?source=feed_text&epa=HASHTAG&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAlb4Af_SMM2oWX2M2YI4IDlCbBFp6p-4K1xJC-ywTj7fb1i6EztwESLyMgpJmt86RzJNT1M5CYYaN86LkbHS6JKHUQ2QImFxzem3_8f49wdHBCxV98vW6dy24-XafX22JYEQh8vkdWb-R9vJbKDDjsfMVZ7ONdkks0uIgls9gJVBz66l6p0ytXiq1XpvcCiTHUU5jirEletQZ4wDayw_He9-tmz57NfMKc4QYgdaYFhXWmNNxkkAz3JdVcZlLqaURBNQ&__tn__=%2ANK-R){:target="_blank"} I got a set of eco-friendly straws and dorayaki. At the [Dcard](https://www.dcard.tw/){:target="_blank"} booth, I got a sticker set and eco-friendly cup sleeve again this year, plus a nihilistic quote wet wipe. [17 Live](https://17.live/){:target="_blank"} had a survey to enter a draw for [AirPods 2](../33afa0ae557d/). I got stickers at the [[weak self](https://weakself.dev/){:target="_blank"}] podcast booth. There were also interactive booths from [Grindr](https://www.grindr.com/){:target="_blank"}, [CakeResume](https://www.cakeresume.com/zh-TW){:target="_blank"}, and [Bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io/){:target="_blank"}. Attached is a **partial** photo of the loot.

**Food and After Party**: Both days featured exquisite meal boxes, with unlimited iced coffee and tea available all day. Last year, the After Party felt more like being in a bar, listening to the speakers share stories on stage, which was very entertaining. This year, it was more like afternoon tea (still serving alcohol, with delicious shumai and desserts!). People mingled on their own, and I actually made new friends this year.

### Top 5 Agenda Takeaways

#### **1. [Wei Wang](https://medium.com/u/52b3ba2db3a){:target="_blank"} (Cat God)'s Network Request Component Design**

This part resonates deeply because our project does not use third-party networking libraries; instead, we encapsulate methods ourselves. Many design patterns and issues mentioned by the speaker are exactly the optimizations and refactoring tasks we need to undertake. Applying what the speaker said:

> "Trash needs sorting, and so does code..."

This part needs thorough research. I will organize it well &lt;( _ _ )&gt;  
*p.s. Missed out on the KingFisher sticker QQ*

#### 2. **Japan's Great [kishikawa katsumi](https://twitter.com/k_katsumi){:target="_blank"}**

Introduces the new method [UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicollectionviewcompositionallayout){:target="_blank"} introduced in iOS ≥ 13, which allows us to avoid subclassing UICollectionViewLayout or using nested CollectionView Cells to achieve complex layouts as before.  
This part resonated with me as our app used the latter approach to achieve the desired design style. At its peak, we had CollectionView Cell containing CollectionView, which in turn contained another CollectionView (three layers), making the code messy and hard to maintain.  
Besides introducing the structure and usage of UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout, the highlight is that the speaker created a project based on this pattern, enabling apps running on iOS 12 and earlier to support the same effects — [IBPCollectionViewCompositionalLayout](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/IBPCollectionViewCompositionalLayout){:target="_blank"}. Amazing!

#### 3. [Ethan Huang](https://medium.com/u/e13f6afcf9b9){:target="_blank"} Developing Apple Watch Apps with SwiftUI by Ethan Huang

I previously wrote an article titled "[Let's Build an Apple Watch App!](../e85d77b05061/)," which was based on watchOS 5 using the traditional method. I didn't expect that now we can develop with SwiftUI!

Apple Watch OS 6 supports generations 1 to 5, so **there are fewer version issues**. Using watch apps to practice SwiftUI is a good starting point (relatively simplified); I'll find time to update it.

*p.s. I didn't expect watchOS developers to be so niche QQ. Personally, I find it quite fun and hope more people will join!*

#### 4. Security Issues of TinXie-Yizhi and Yang Xiaomie’s Apps

Regarding **the security issues of the APP itself,** I had never seriously studied it before, as I always believed that "Apple is very closed and secure!" After listening to the demonstrations by two speakers, I realized it is fragile rather than strong, and I understood the core concept of APP security itself:

> "When the cost of cracking exceeds the cost of protection, the app is secure."

No app can guarantee complete security; it can only increase the difficulty of hacking to deter attackers!

Besides the paid app Reveal, there is also the open-source and free Lookin for viewing app UIs; we use Reveal frequently. Even if you don't inspect others' apps, it's very convenient for debugging your own UI issues!

Additionally, **regarding connection security**, a few days ago I posted an article titled "[The app uses HTTPS transmission, but data was still stolen.](../46410aaada00/)" I used [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/){:target="_blank"}, a free tool, to perform a man-in-the-middle attack by swapping the root CA. Through the speaker’s explanation of man-in-the-middle attacks, their principles, and protection methods, I both verified the accuracy of my writing and gained a deeper understanding of this technique!  
I also broadened my horizons... learning that there are jailbreak tweaks that can directly intercept network requests without even needing to swap certificates.

#### 5. Ting Peiyao's Great Optimization of Compilation Speed

This has always been a frustrating issue for us: slow compilation. Sometimes when tweaking the UI, it can be really maddening. You adjust by just 1pt, then wait, see the result, adjust by 1pt again, wait again, then change it back... while(true)... very frustrating!

The speaker's attempts and experience sharing are definitely worth exploring for use in your own projects!

> *There are many more sessions (for example: risque topics A_A, previously also encountered color-related issues)*

> *But since the notes are scattered, and I have no related experience or did not attend that session*

> *All content can wait for the release of the [iPlayground 2019](https://iplayground.io/2019/){:target="_blank"} video replay (for sessions with recordings), or refer to the official [HackMD collaborative notes](https://hackmd.io/@iPlayground){:target="_blank"}.*

### Soft Gains

Besides technical gains, I personally gained more in terms of **soft skills** compared to last year. For the first time, I met [Ethan Huang](https://medium.com/u/e13f6afcf9b9){:target="_blank"} in person. While discussing the Apple Watch development ecosystem, I also casually exchanged a few words with the Cat God; additionally, I met many new developers, including my colleague Frank, [Taihsin](https://twitter.com/taihsin_l){:target="_blank"} (a classmate of [George Liu](https://medium.com/u/72361fccaa43){:target="_blank"}), [Spock Xue](https://medium.com/u/e55ade4a40a3){:target="_blank"}, [Crystal Liu](https://medium.com/u/2b9530ad5d14){:target="_blank"}, [Nia Fan](https://medium.com/u/8fdb2b5b6672){:target="_blank"}, Alice, Ada, old classmates like [Peter Chen](https://medium.com/u/d3a2b0073ab2){:target="_blank"}, and former colleague Hao Ge [Qiu Yuhao](https://medium.com/u/bee7081e8048){:target="_blank"}... and many other new friends!
