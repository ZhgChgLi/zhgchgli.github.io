### What was the experience of iPlayground 2019 like?

Insights from attending iPlayground 2019

### About the Event

Last year, it was held in mid-October, and I only started managing my Medium account to document my life at the beginning of October last year; combining the UUID topic I heard about and my experiences, I also wrote an [article](../a4bc3bce7513/); this year, I continue to **share my insights to ride the wave**!

iPlayground 2019 (This time, it was again sponsored by [the company](https://www.cakeresume.com/companies/addcn?locale=zh-TW){:target="_blank"} for corporate tickets)

Compared to the first edition in 2018, this year's event has significantly improved in various aspects!

**First, regarding the venue**, last year it was held in a small conference room on the basement floor, which felt quite cramped and made it difficult to use computers in the lecture rooms; this year, it was directly moved to the National Taiwan University’s Boya Hall, which is spacious and new, avoiding overcrowding, and the classrooms have tables/outlets, making it convenient to use personal computers!

**In terms of the agenda**, in addition to local experts, this time, international speakers were also invited to share their insights; among them, the highly anticipated guest was none other than the renowned [Wei Wang](https://medium.com/u/52b3ba2db3a){:target="_blank"}; this year also marked the first time workshops were included for hands-on teaching, but spots were limited, so one had to act fast… I missed out while busy eating and chatting.

**The sponsor booths and the Ask the Speaker area** made interactions easier due to the larger venue, with more activities; from the [iChef](https://www.ichefpos.com/zh-tw){:target="_blank"} booth, I received a set of eco-friendly straws and dorayaki, the [Dcard](https://www.dcard.tw/){:target="_blank"} booth, which I had already visited last year, provided another set of stickers + an eco-friendly cup sleeve, and this year included a nihilistic quote wet wipe, while [17 Live](https://17.live/){:target="_blank"} had a questionnaire for a chance to win [Airpods 2](../33afa0ae557d/), at the \[ [weak self](https://weakself.dev/){:target="_blank"} \] Podcast booth, I got some stickers, and there were also interactive booths from [Grindr](https://www.grindr.com/){:target="_blank"}, [CakeResume](https://www.cakeresume.com/zh-TW){:target="_blank"}, and [Bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io/){:target="_blank"}; here’s a **partial** photo of my loot.

Incomplete Spoils

**Food and After Party**: Both days featured exquisite meal boxes, with unlimited iced coffee and tea available all day; however, last year had more of an After Party vibe, like listening to stories from the stage at a bar, which was very interesting; this year felt more like afternoon tea (still serving alcohol, and the siu mai and desserts were delicious!); it was more of a self-interaction, but I actually made new friends this year.

### Top 5 Agenda Takeaways
#### **1. [Wei Wang](https://medium.com/u/52b3ba2db3a){:target="_blank"} (Cat God) on Network Request Component Design**

This part resonated with me because our project does not use third-party network libraries; instead, we encapsulate methods ourselves. Many design patterns and issues mentioned by the speaker are optimizations and refactoring tasks we need to undertake. As the speaker said:

> "Garbage needs to be sorted, and so does code..."

I need to study this part thoroughly; I will make sure to categorize it. <\( __ \)>
_p.s. I didn't manage to grab a KingFisher sticker QQ_
#### 2. **Japan's [kishikawa katsumi](https://twitter.com/k_katsumi){:target="_blank"}**

Introduced the new method [UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicollectionviewcompositionallayout){:target="_blank"} released in iOS ≥ 13, which allows us to avoid subclassing UICollectionViewLayout or using CollectionView Cells to wrap CollectionViews to achieve complex layouts as we did before. This part also resonated with me; our app uses the latter method to achieve the desired design style, with a peak creation involving a CollectionView Cell wrapping another CollectionView, which in turn wraps another CollectionView (three layers), resulting in messy and hard-to-maintain code. Besides introducing the structure and usage of UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout, the speaker uniquely created a project based on this model that allows apps prior to iOS 12 to support the same effect — [IBPCollectionViewCompositionalLayout](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/IBPCollectionViewCompositionalLayout){:target="_blank"}, which is amazing!
#### 3. [Ethan Huang](https://medium.com/u/e13f6afcf9b9){:target="_blank"} on Developing Apple Watch Apps with SwiftUI

I previously wrote an article titled "[Let's Make an Apple Watch App!](../e85d77b05061/)", which was based on watchOS 5 using traditional methods; I didn't expect that we could now develop using SwiftUI! Apple Watch OS 6 supports versions 1 to 5, so **there are fewer version issues**. Practicing SwiftUI with watch applications is also a good starting point (relatively simplified); I will find time to refresh my knowledge. 
_p.s. I just didn't expect that watchOS developers are also so marginalized QQ. Personally, I find it quite fun and hope more people can join!_
#### 4. TinXie - Yi Zhi and Yang Xiao Mie's APP Security Issues

Regarding **the security issues of the APP itself**, I had never seriously researched it; my inherent belief was that "Apple is very closed and secure!" After listening to the presentations from the two speakers, I realized it is quite fragile and not robust, and I also understood the core concept of APP security:

> "When the cost of cracking exceeds the cost of protection, the APP is secure."

There are no guarantees of APP security, only increased difficulty in cracking, which deters attackers!

Additionally, besides the paid APP Reveal, there is also the open-source free Lookin to view APP UI; we often use Reveal; even if not looking at others, it is very convenient to debug UI issues ourselves!

Furthermore, **regarding connection security**, just a few days ago, I published an article titled "[APP uses HTTPS for transmission, but data is still stolen.](../46410aaada00/)", using the free software [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/){:target="_blank"} to perform man-in-the-middle attacks by replacing the root CA; through the speaker's explanation of man-in-the-middle attacks, principles, and protective measures, I not only verified whether my written content was correct but also gained a deeper understanding of this method! I also opened my eyes to know that there are jailbreak plugins that can directly intercept network requests without needing to replace certificates.
#### 5. Ding Peiyao on Optimizing Compilation Speed


This has always been a problem that troubles us: the slow compilation; sometimes during UI fine-tuning, it can really drive you crazy. You adjust just 1pt, then you have to wait, see the result, correct another 1pt, wait again, and then adjust back... while(true)... It's really frustrating!

The speaker's attempts and experience sharing are definitely worth researching for application in our own projects!


> _There are still many sessions (for example: the colorful matters A_A, I've previously encountered issues with colors)_ 
 

> _However, due to the scattered notes, I personally have no relevant experience or did not attend that session_ 
 

> _All content can wait for the release of the recording playback of [iPlayground 2019](https://iplayground.io/2019/){:target="_blank"} (for sessions that were recorded), or refer to the official [HackMD collaborative notes](https://hackmd.io/@iPlayground){:target="_blank"}._ 




### Soft Gains

In addition to technical gains, I personally gained more " **soft gains** " than last year. I had my first face-to-face meeting with [Ethan Huang](https://medium.com/u/e13f6afcf9b9){:target="_blank"} and inadvertently exchanged a few words with Cat God while discussing the Apple Watch development ecosystem. Additionally, I met many new developers, including my colleague Frank, [George Liu](https://medium.com/u/72361fccaa43){:target="_blank"}'s classmate [Taihsin](https://twitter.com/taihsin_l){:target="_blank"}, [Spock 薛](https://medium.com/u/e55ade4a40a3){:target="_blank"}, [Crystal Liu](https://medium.com/u/2b9530ad5d14){:target="_blank"}, [Nia Fan](https://medium.com/u/8fdb2b5b6672){:target="_blank"}, Alice, Ada, old classmate [Peter Chen](https://medium.com/u/d3a2b0073ab2){:target="_blank"}, and old colleague Hao Ge [邱鈺晧](https://medium.com/u/bee7081e8048){:target="_blank"}... and many other new friends!
