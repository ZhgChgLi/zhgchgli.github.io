### Things to Know About Automatically Backing Up Medium Articles to GitHub Pages (Jekyll)

A record of building, maintaining, upgrading, and customizing a personal Medium article backup mirror site.

#### Introduction

As I enter my sixth year of using Medium, I surpassed 100 articles last year. With the passage of time and the growing number of articles, I increasingly worry that one day Medium might suddenly shut down or that my account could encounter issues, leading to the loss of all my hard work. While some articles may not hold much value, many serve as records of technical frameworks and problem-solving thoughts from that time. I often revisit my older articles to refresh my knowledge. Additionally, in recent years, I've started documenting my travel experiences abroad, which are cherished memories and have performed well in terms of traffic. Losing this content would mean I could never rewrite it.

#### Developing a Backup Tool

I usually write articles directly on the Medium platform without any personal backup. Therefore, during the 2022 New Year period, I spent time developing a tool to download Medium articles and convert them into Markdown files (including article images, embedded code, etc.) â€” **[ZMediumToMarkdown](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"}:**

[![](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/493527574/9b5b7025-cc95-4e81-84a9-b38706093c27)](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"}

I then extended the use of this tool to deploy the downloaded Markdown files as a static backup mirror site on GitHub Pages using [Jekyll (Chirpy Theme)](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy){:target="_blank"} â€” [https://zhgchg.li/](https://zhgchg.li/){:target="_blank"}

![[https://zhgchg.li/](https://zhgchg.li/){:target="_blank"}](/assets/5bb7d3a4954f/1*oM79EdbsiBYiWnqb0mH8QQ.png)

[https://zhgchg.li/](https://zhgchg.li/){:target="_blank"}

At that time, I integrated the entire setup into a GitHub Template Repo so that friends with similar needs could quickly deploy it â€” [ZMediumToJekyll](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToJekyll){:target="_blank"}. Since then (in 2022), I haven't updated the version or settings of [Jekyll (Chirpy Theme)](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy){:target="_blank"}; however, [**ZMediumToMarkdown**](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"} **has been continuously maintained, and I promptly fix any formatting parsing errors that arise. It is currently stable.**

The version of [Jekyll (Chirpy Theme)](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy){:target="_blank"} I was using at that time was v5.x, which had no major issues and included all necessary features (e.g., pinning, categories, tags, cover images, comments, etc.). However, there were frequent scrolling issues where the page would become unresponsive, but after a few attempts, it would return to normal. This was a shortcoming in the user experience. I once tried upgrading to v6.x, but the issue persisted, and I received no response from the official support. Additionally, as versions upgrade, conflicts tend to increase, so I eventually abandoned the idea of upgrading.

Recently, I decided to tackle the issues with [Jekyll (Chirpy Theme)](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy){:target="_blank"}, upgrade the version, and optimize the quick deployment tool [ZMediumToJekyll](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToJekyll){:target="_blank"}.

### New! medium-to-jekyll-starter ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

I have integrated the latest version v7.x of [**Jekyll (Chirpy Theme)**](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy){:target="_blank"} with my [**ZMediumToMarkdown**](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"} Medium article download and conversion tool into a new â€” [medium-to-jekyll-starter.github.io](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/medium-to-jekyll-starter.github.io){:target="_blank"} GitHub Template Repo.

Everyone can use this template repo to quickly set up their own Medium mirror content backup site, **with a one-time setup for continuous automatic backups, deployed on GitHub Pages completely free**.

> _*All the articles above are **automatically** downloaded from my Medium account, converted to Markdown format, and re-uploaded._

> **_Hereâ€™s a comparison example of the conversion results of a random article:_**

> **_[Original content on Medium](https://shorturl.at/CG9ua){:target="_blank"} / [Converted result on my personal site](../78507a8de6a5/)_**

After the upgrade, the scrolling issue has been resolved, and I also added customized dynamic content (displaying the number of Medium followers).

### Some Technical Records

The deployment method for [Jekyll (Chirpy Theme)](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy){:target="_blank"} on GitHub Pages mainly follows the official Start Repo:

[![](https://opengraph.githubassets.com/3b11a63cf12622e6e904699627d64c75396133de90c8c7008148f3bb19149693/cotes2020/chirpy-starter)](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter/tree/main){:target="_blank"}

> _Last month, I also referenced this project to create a new open-source project â€” [Linkyee](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/linkyee){:target="_blank"} which is an open-source version of a Link Tree personal link page._

#### Jekyll Customization Method (1) â€” Override HTML

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} is a powerful Ruby static site generator. [Jekyll (Chirpy Theme)](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy){:target="_blank"} is just a theme based on Jekyll. After comparing with other themes, I found that [Chirpy Theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy){:target="_blank"} offers the best quality, user experience, and comprehensive features.

Jekyll pages have inheritance properties, allowing us to add files with the same name as Jekyll's page files in `./_layouts`. The engine will use your custom page content to replace the original when generating site content.

For example, if I want to add a line of text at the end of each article page, I first copy the original article page file ([post.html](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/blob/master/_layouts/post.html){:target="_blank"}) and place it in the `./_layouts` directory:

![](/assets/5bb7d3a4954f/1*oDykwzZ0P5o8GEw8lc3WPQ.png)

I can then open `post.html` in an editor, add the text or customization in the appropriate location, and redeploy the site to see the customized result.

![](/assets/5bb7d3a4954f/1*7ni973_1JykXoj8le78v1A.png)

You can also create a `./_include` directory to store some shared page content files:

![](/assets/5bb7d3a4954f/1*rExx8jMcMfEQZ3LfvhwT2w.png)

Then in `post.html`, you can directly use `{% include buymeacoffee.html %}` to include the HTML content from the shared file.

> _The advantage of overriding HTML layout files is 100% customization; you can freely adjust how the page content and layout are presented. The downside is that during the upgrade process, you may encounter conflicts or unexpected results, requiring you to review your customizations again._

#### Jekyll Customization Method (2) â€” Plugin

The second method is to use the [Plugin](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/){:target="_blank"} with the [Hook](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/hooks/#built-in-hook-owners-and-events){:target="_blank"} method to inject your desired custom content during the static content generation phase in Jekyll.

![](/assets/5bb7d3a4954f/1*JI-uJ8tIKnomJyQk9cVfyQ.png)

![[Built-in Hook Owners and Events](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/hooks/#built-in-hook-owners-and-events){:target="_blank"}](/assets/5bb7d3a4954f/1*GrUJn6HXoBqYXUQMKrnqTA.png)

There are many [Hook events](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/hooks/#built-in-hook-owners-and-events){:target="_blank"} available; here I will only mention the ones I used: `site:pre_render` and `post:pre_render`.

Adding a new hook is simple; just create a Ruby file in `./_plugins`.

![posts-lastmod-hook.rb is an existing Plugin](/assets/5bb7d3a4954f/1*1QTCNuYJbJPlfJoMrc6v5g.png)

I wanted a few "pseudo" dynamic content features, the first being to display the number of Medium followers under my profile and the last updated time at the bottom of the page.

![](/assets/5bb7d3a4954f/1*6JA9ONLP_A0eNL_q-5b6yg.png)

In the `./_plugins` directory, I created a file named `zhgchgli-customize.rb`:
```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
#
require 'net/http'
require 'nokogiri'
require 'uri'
require 'date'

def load_medium_followers(url, limit = 10)
  return 0 if limit.zero?

  uri = URI(url)
  response = Net::HTTP.get_response(uri)
  case response
  when Net::HTTPSuccess then
      document = Nokogiri::HTML(response.body)

      follower_count_element = document.at('span.pw-follower-count > a')
      follower_count = follower_count_element&.text&.split(' ')&.first

      return follower_count || 0
  when Net::HTTPRedirection then
    location = response['location']
    return load_medium_followers(location, limit - 1)
  else
      return 0
  end
end

$medium_url = "https://medium.com/@zhgchgli"
# could also define in _config.yml and retrieve in Jekyll::Hooks.register :site, :pre_render do |site| site.config

$medium_followers = load_medium_followers($medium_url)

$medium_followers = 1000 if $medium_followers == 0
$medium_followers = $medium_followers.to_s.reverse.scan(/\d{1,3}/).join(',').reverse

Jekyll::Hooks.register :site, :pre_render do |site|

  tagline = site.config['tagline']
  
  followMe = <<-HTML
  <a href="#{$medium_url}" target="_blank" style="display: block;text-align: center;font-style: normal;/* text-decoration: underline; */font-size: 1.2em;color: var(--heading-color);">#{$medium_followers}+ Followers on Medium</a>
  HTML

  site.config['tagline'] = "#{followMe}";
  site.config['tagline'] += tagline;

  meta_data = site.data.dig('locales', 'en', 'meta');
  # only implementation in en, could implement to all langs.

  if meta_data
    gmt_plus_8 = Time.now.getlocal("+08:00")
    formatted_time = gmt_plus_8.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    site.data['locales']['en']['meta'] += "<br/>Last updated: #{formatted_time} +08:00"
  end
end
```
- The principle is to register a hook before the site renders, injecting HTML to display the Medium follower count in the personal profile section.
- The Medium follower count will be scraped for the latest number each time it runs.
- The logic for the last updated time at the bottom of the page is similar; it appends the last updated time string to `locales->en->meta` during site generation.
- Additionally, if it's a hook before article generation, you can access the Markdown, and after article generation, you can access the generated HTML.

After saving, you can test the results locally with `bundle exec jekyll s`:

![](/assets/5bb7d3a4954f/1*T1idAZIWAJ2N9J054-PFSA.png)

Open your browser and go to `127.0.0.1:4000` to view the results.

Finally, add a scheduled job in the GitHub Pages Repo Actions to automatically regenerate the site:

![](/assets/5bb7d3a4954f/1*2BFHmkhnytEwHTkNHwZsTg.png)

In the [Jekyll (Chirpy Theme)](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy){:target="_blank"} Repo project, find the Actions file named `pages-deploy.yml` and add the following under `on:`:
```yaml
  schedule:
    - cron: "10 1 * * *" # Automatically execute once daily at UTC 01:10, https://crontab.guru
```

> _The advantage of using plugins is that you can achieve dynamic content effects (scheduled updates) without affecting the site structure, avoiding conflicts during upgrades; the downside is that the content and display positions you can adjust are limited._

#### Issues with GitHub Pages Deployment After Jekyll (Chirpy Theme) v7.x

In addition to structural adjustments, the deployment script for v7.x has also changed; the original [deploy.sh](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/medium-to-jekyll-starter.github.io/blob/main/tools/deploy.sh){:target="_blank"} deployment script has been removed, and the deployment steps now directly use GitHub Actions:
```yaml
# build:
# ...
      - name: Upload site artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: "_site${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_path }}"

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

However, I encountered an issue during deployment:

`Uploaded artifact size of 1737778940 bytes exceeds the allowed size of 1 GB` because my site content was too large, causing the Upload Artifact to fail. Since the previous deployment script worked, I had to revert to using the original [deploy.sh](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/medium-to-jekyll-starter.github.io/blob/main/tools/deploy.sh){:target="_blank"} and [comment out the above section](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/zhgchgli.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml){:target="_blank"}.

#### GitHub Pages Deployment Test Site Step Failing

The deployment of [Jekyll (Chirpy Theme)](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy){:target="_blank"} includes a step to test the site, checking if the web content is correct, such as whether links are functioning and if HTML tags are missing, etc.:
```yaml
# build:
# ...
      - name: Test site
        run: |
          bundle exec htmlproofer _site \
            --disable-external \
            --no-enforce-https \
            --ignore-empty-alt \
            --ignore-urls "/^http:\/\/127.0.0.1/,/^http:\/\/0.0.0.0/,/^http:\/\/localhost/"
```

I added `--no-enforce-https` and `--ignore-empty-alt` to ignore checks for HTTPS and missing HTML tag alt attributes, **which allowed the checks to pass (since I couldn't modify the content temporarily)**.

The CLI command for [htmlproofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer){:target="_blank"} does not mention these options in the official documentation; I found the rules after searching through an issue's [comment](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer/issues/727#issuecomment-1334430268){:target="_blank"}.
