### Google Offerwall Ads

![<https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/13860694?hl=zh-Hant>{:target="_blank"}](/assets/ba132457e6a5/1*DNW0ylu9LHLs4ztWVzw3UQ.png)

[Google Offerwall](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/13860694?hl=zh-Hant){:target="_blank"} is, in my opinion, a **reward-based Offerwall ad** that combines the features of rewarded ads. Developers can easily **require users to complete tasks before accessing specific website content pages**. The **tasks are Offerwall reward tasks**, which can be set as completing surveys, watching ads, making small payments, subscribing to newsletters, or [integrating tasks from your own system](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/13566866?hl=zh-Hant&ref_topic=13821812&sjid=14925592883586634734-NC){:target="_blank"}. The rewards grant access rights that can be unlimited for several hours or days, or limited by quantity. All of this can be achieved simply by embedding Google Adsense dynamic ad code, without the need to develop your own system.

#### ✅ Advantages

- **Easy Implementation**: Simply [embed the dynamic ad code](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9189560?hl=zh-Hant){:target="_blank"} on your website once, and use it for life.

- **Direct Profit**: Similar to Google Adsense benefits, there is no need to build a complex advertising system or data tracking system yourself; nor do you need to find advertisers to place ads. Everything is managed and operated by the platform.

- **Flexible and Diverse**: Provides more flexible and diverse content and monetization methods.

- **Cross-platform**: Supports both mobile and desktop versions.

#### ❌ Disadvantages

- **Low Bids**: This is also a common issue with Google AdSense, where ad bids are low.

- **Easily Blocked**: Since Google Offerwall is purely a front-end ad overlay, it can be easily bypassed by ad blockers or users using developer tools; **therefore, it is not recommended to implement it over sensitive, important, or valuable content.**

#### 📝 Technical Requirements

- You need to apply and get approved by [Google Adsense](https://adsense.google.com/){:target="_blank"} first.  
  **The threshold is now lower; as long as you have a website URL and 5–10 articles, you can basically get approved.**

- The website needs to embed dynamic ad code in the HTML Head [embed dynamic ad code](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9189560?hl=zh-Hant){:target="_blank"}

#### ❤️ Suitable Scenarios

- **For Advertising**: Similar to Google Adsense, suitable for small to medium content websites or personal blogs without self-sold ad spaces, such as sites hosted on [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/zh-tw/){:target="_blank"} or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}. Besides displaying regular ad spaces, you can also set up Offerwall reward wall ads for valuable content articles.  
  **This article uses For Advertising as a case study; currently, except for advertising, other features are still in Beta.**

- **For surveys, micro-payments, and newsletter subscriptions**: Any website can use this mechanism to quickly create pop-up ads.

### Installation and Activation Steps

#### Embedding Dynamic Ad Code

First, confirm that the website has embedded the Google Adsense ad code. If dynamic ads were used before, this step can be skipped.

**Go to [Google Adsense](https://adsense.google.com/){:target="_blank"} -> Ads -> By site -> Get code:**

Place the code inside the website's `<head></head>` section:

```xml

  //...
  <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-3184248473087645" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

#### Test Offerwall Ads

Use an incognito browser and make sure ad blockers and anti-tracking extensions are disabled, then visit the webpage specified in the rules:

![[https://zhgchg.li/posts/c008a9e8ceca/](../c008a9e8ceca/)](/assets/ba132457e6a5/1*OSEzFBhd-wXSAdm-41aLjQ.png)

[https://zhgchg.li/posts/c008a9e8ceca/](../c008a9e8ceca/)

> Success 🙌🙌🙌

Try to use Chrome incognito mode for testing. Safari requires disabling ad blockers and anti-tracking, which can be more troublesome.

#### Revenue Aspect

Because my page views are low, the bid per click is also low, ranging from about USD $0.01 to $0.07 per click.

### Medium To Github Pages x Google Offerwall

You can refer to my previous article "[Pain-free Migration from Medium to Self-hosted Website](../a0c08d579ab1/)" to mirror Medium articles to a static site hosted on GitHub Pages. Then, add Google Offerwall to the site to monetize the content.

Or directly refer to "[Medium Partner Program is finally open to writers worldwide (including Taiwan)!](../cefdf4d41746/)" to add Medium articles behind a paywall and earn revenue.

> *Because Medium's paywall requires readers to subscribe monthly to access articles, which I find unfriendly to information sharing, I do not include my articles in the paywall program. Google Offerwall fills this gap perfectly, allowing users to support content creators by simply watching ads without forced monthly fees, enabling creators to earn revenue—it's a win-win!*

### ***[Supplement] Explanation of Offerwall Reward Wall Ads and Rewarded Ad Types***

#### Offerwall — What is a Reward Wall Ad?

Compared to traditional fixed-position ads, rewarded wall ads emphasize interaction and purpose with users. They integrate content display, reward incentives, and user behavior, allowing users not only to choose to pay to unlock premium items but also to earn extra resources in a more engaging and participatory way. Creators can gain additional revenue, achieving a win-win outcome.

**Example — Line Points Reward Wall**

![](/assets/ba132457e6a5/1*SWF8K0p5asGiDoPMhZRAWQ.jpeg)

A classic everyday example is Line Points. Users can either directly purchase Line Points or choose tasks they like from the Offwall reward wall (adding friends, registering accounts, filling out surveys, watching ads, etc.) and receive corresponding rewards upon completion.

#### Rewarded Ads — **Rewarded Ads**

Rewarded ads are a common advertising format in games and mobile apps. Users voluntarily complete specific actions, such as **watching a video, clicking interactive content, or trying a feature**, to earn rewards like virtual currency, extra lives, or game items.

**Example — Candy Crush**

![](/assets/ba132457e6a5/1*D9PdoZg-mlCbtO19roltdQ.png)

A classic example is ads that allow players to continue playing after dying in a game. These ads not only increase user engagement and satisfaction but also enable developers to generate revenue without harming the user experience, achieving a win-win outcome.
