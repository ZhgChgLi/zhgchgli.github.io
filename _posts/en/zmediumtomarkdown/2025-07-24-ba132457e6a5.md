### Google Offerwall Ads

![[https://support\.google\.com/admanager/answer/13860694?hl=zh\-Hant](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/13860694?hl=zh-Hant){:target="_blank"}](/assets/ba132457e6a5/1*DNW0ylu9LHLs4ztWVzw3UQ.png)

[https://support\.google\.com/admanager/answer/13860694?hl=zh\-Hant](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/13860694?hl=zh-Hant){:target="_blank"}

The "[Google Offerwall](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/13860694?hl=zh-Hant){:target="_blank"}" is, in my opinion, a " **reward-based Offerwall ad** " that combines the characteristics of reward-based advertising. Developers can easily **specify that website content pages require completing tasks to access**. The tasks are Offerwall reward wall tasks, which can be set for users to complete interest surveys, watch ads, make small payments, subscribe to newsletters‚Ä¶ or [integrate tasks from their own systems](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/13566866?hl=zh-Hant&ref_topic=13821812&sjid=14925592883586634734-NC){:target="_blank"}. The rewards can be access permissions that allow unlimited access for a few hours or days, or they can be limited in quantity; all of this can be achieved simply by embedding Google Adsense dynamic ad code, without the need to develop a system independently.

#### ‚úÖ Advantages
- **Easy to Implement**: Just embed the [dynamic ad code](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9189560?hl=zh-Hant){:target="_blank"} on the website, and it can be used for a lifetime after a one-time setup.
- **Direct Profit**: Similar to the benefits of Google Adsense, there is no need to build a complex advertising system or data tracking system; there is also no need to find advertisers to place ads, as everything is managed by the platform.
- **Flexible and Diverse**: Provides more flexible and diverse ways to monetize content and traffic.
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports both mobile and desktop versions.

#### ‚ùå Disadvantages
- **Low Bids**: This is a common issue with Google Adsense, where ad bids are low.
- **Easily Blocked**: Since Google Offerwall is purely a front-end ad overlay, it can easily be blocked by ad-blocking plugins or users can bypass it using developer tools; **therefore, it is not recommended to implement it over sensitive or valuable content.**

#### üìù Technical Requirements
- You need to apply and be approved by [Google Adsense](https://adsense.google.com/){:target="_blank"}.
**The threshold is relatively low now; as long as you have a website URL and 5‚Äì10 articles, you can generally get approved.**
- The website needs to be able to [embed dynamic ad code](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9189560?hl=zh-Hant){:target="_blank"} in the HTML Head.

#### ‚ù§Ô∏è Suitable Scenarios
- **For Ads**: Similar to Google Adsense, suitable for small to medium content websites or personal blogs without self-sold ad spaces, such as websites hosted on [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/zh-tw/){:target="_blank"} or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}; in addition to displaying original ad spaces, you can also set Offerwall reward wall ads for valuable content articles.
**This article will use For Ads as a case study; currently, everything else is still in Beta.**
- **For Surveys, Small Payments, Newsletter Subscriptions**: Any website can use this mechanism to quickly create pop-up ads.

### Installation Steps
#### Embed Dynamic Ad Code

First, ensure that the website has embedded the Google Adsense ad code. If you have previously used dynamic ads, you can skip this step.

**Go to [Google Adsense](https://adsense.google.com/){:target="_blank"} \-&gt; Ads \-&gt; Click on the website \-&gt; Get Code:**

4, 8
1. **Ad Name**
2. **Your Website**: Set the website to apply.
3. **Included and Excluded Items**: You can set the page URLs to include or exclude.
_I set it so that only URLs under the `https://zhgchg.li/posts/` path will trigger._
4. **Default Language**: Set the default language and other supported languages; you can switch languages in the upper left corner to edit different language texts.
5. **Measurement**: You can set how many times a user must browse a webpage before triggering.
_I set it to 0, meaning it triggers on the first visit._
6. **Reward Ads**: You can set the content unlock rewards for completing tasks, which can be unlimited browsing within a time frame or limited webpage views; after the reward expires, the task needs to be completed again.
_I set it so that completing one task allows unlimited browsing for 24 hours._
7. **Copy Settings**: Specify the copy content; remember to upload a logo to enhance brand power.
8. **Style Settings**: After clicking on the copy in 7, you can also set text styles and colors from here.
You can refer to the [testing method](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/13860694?hl=zh-Hant#zippy=%2C%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E6%B8%AC%E8%A9%A6-offerwall){:target="_blank"} to preview results by adding `?fc=alwaysshow&fctype=monetization` to the page URL.
9. **Publish Changes**: After everything is set, remember to click publish.

Confirm that the ad is in a published state.

#### Test Offerwall Ads

Use an incognito browser, ensure that ad blockers and anti-tracking plugins are disabled, and then go to the webpage within the rules:

[https://zhgchg\.li/posts/c008a9e8ceca/](../c008a9e8ceca/)

> Success üôåüôåüôå 

Try to use Chrome incognito for testing; using Safari requires turning off ad blockers and anti-tracking, which can be more troublesome.

#### Revenue Aspects

Due to my low traffic, the bid per click is also not very high, with a single ad click ranging from USD $0.01 to $0.07.

### Medium To Github Pages x Google Offerwall

You can refer to my previous article "[Seamless Transfer from Medium to Self-Hosted Website](../a0c08d579ab1/)" to mirror Medium articles to a static website hosted on GitHub Pages, and then add Google Offerwall to monetize the content.

Or directly refer to "[Medium Partner Program Finally Open to Global Writers (Including Taiwan)!](../cefdf4d41746/)" to add Medium articles to a paywall for revenue.

> _Since the Medium paywall mechanism requires readers to pay a monthly fee to join Medium to read articles, I feel it is not very friendly for information dissemination; therefore, my articles have not joined the paywall plan. With Google Offerwall, it perfectly fills this gap, allowing users to easily watch ads to support content creators without being forced into a monthly payment, benefiting both creators and users!_

### **_\[Supplement\] Explanation of Offerwall Reward Wall Ads and Reward-Based Ad Types_**
#### Offerwall ‚Äî What Are Reward Wall Ads?

Compared to traditional fixed-position ads, reward wall ads emphasize interaction and purpose between users. They integrate content display, reward incentives, and user behavior, allowing users to choose to pay to unlock premium items or obtain additional resources in a more engaging and participatory way. Creators can gain additional revenue from this, achieving a win-win effect.

**Example ‚Äî Line Points Reward Wall**

![](/assets/ba132457e6a5/1*SWF8K0p5asGiDoPMhZRAWQ.jpeg)

A classic example in daily life is ‚Äî Line Points. Users can not only directly purchase Line Points but also select preferred tasks (adding friends, registering accounts, filling out surveys, watching ads, etc.) from the Offwall reward wall to complete and receive corresponding rewards.

#### Rewarded Ads ‚Äî **Reward-Based Ads**

Rewarded ads are a common form of advertising found in games and mobile applications, where users voluntarily complete specific actions, such as **watching a video, clicking interactive content, or trying out specific features**, to earn rewards like virtual currency, extra lives, or game items.

**Example ‚Äî Candy Crush**

![](/assets/ba132457e6a5/1*D9PdoZg-mlCbtO19roltdQ.png)

A classic case is the ads that allow players to continue playing after dying in games. These ads not only enhance user engagement and satisfaction but also enable developers to generate revenue without affecting user experience, achieving a win-win effect.
