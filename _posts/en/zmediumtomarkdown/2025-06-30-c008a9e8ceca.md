### 2026 Update — Pricing changes for GitHub Actions (including Self-hosted Runner)

> [TLDR — On January 1, 2026, we are lowering the price of hosted runners, and beginning March 1, 2026, we are charging $0.002 per-minute across self-hosted runners. The vast majority of customers will not see a change to their bill. Actions will remain free in public repositories.](https://resources.github.com/actions/2026-pricing-changes-for-github-actions/){:target="_blank"}

GitHub 2025/12/14 [Latest Announcement](https://resources.github.com/actions/2026-pricing-changes-for-github-actions/){:target="_blank"}:

- January 1, 2026: GitHub-hosted Runner is now cheaper, with price reductions up to 39%.

- ⭐️️️ March 1, 2026, **Using Self-hosted Runner requires an additional service maintenance fee of $0.002 per minute (regardless of OS), which means 500 minutes cost $1. Currently, it is still very cost-effective.** ️

- Running on a public repository still stays within the free tier.

**GitHub will also invest more resources to enhance GitHub Actions features:**

- **Scale Set Client:** Simplifies **Autoscaling** for Self-hosted Runners.

- **multi-label: Support restart**, improve Runner label experience.

- **Actions Runner Controller (ARC)** Update: Improved Configuration, Observability, and Version Management.

- **Actions Data Stream:** Provides near real-time workflow/runner event data streams for monitoring and analysis.

[**The official pricing calculator has also been updated**](https://github.com/pricing/calculator){:target="_blank"} **:**

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*CuNXq0t_70UiVY0N3JEacA.png)

- Github Hosted Runner — macOS 3-core(M1): $0.062 USD/minute, 1,000 minutes equals $62 USD

- Self-Hosted Runner — $0.002 USD/minute, 1,000 minutes equals $2 USD

> *Buy the latest model [Mac Mini 10-core (M4)](https://www.apple.com/tw/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini){:target="_blank"} **for about $600 USD**, placing one as a Self-hosted Runner will pay off in about a year; not to mention it has better and faster performance with almost unlimited usage ( **maintenance cost is minimal** ).*

> *You can also use retired old M1 MacBook Pro as a Runner = $0 cost.*

> *The above does not include electricity and internet costs.

#### Preface

After two experiences building App CI/CD in different development teams, I finally have time to organize the journey from "why to do it" to "how to do it." I can't guarantee this is the most standard CI/CD workflow, but it is definitely a valuable starting point to help your team begin implementation, improve product stability, and overall development efficiency.

#### Section

This series will start with "What is CI/CD and its benefits," then proceed with a hands-on guide on "How to set up a CI/CD environment using GitHub Actions + self-hosted Runner," followed by "Implementing CI and CD in app development as an example." Finally, it will introduce "Using Google Apps Script Web App combined with GitHub Actions to create an easy-to-use app packaging platform for cross-team collaboration." I hope this series will be helpful to you.

### What is CI/CD?

#### Story — Development Process Without CI/CD

Before discussing what CI/CD actually is, let's set aside the term "CI/CD" and first recall how a startup development team without any workflow implemented would work. The general process can be summarized in the diagram below:

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*rg4hbs7MsYDU9HZoehrvjQ.png)

1. The product has a bug. Developer T creates a branch fix/bug-c from the main branch to fix it. After completing the fix, the branch is merged back into the main branch.

2. Next, Developer Z branches off feature/a from the main branch to work on requirement A. Halfway through, they notice something is wrong with the feature. **After checking, they find that the current feature was broken and the tests failed**, so they notify Developer T to fix it.

3. After all development is complete, Developer Z **uses his computer to package the version for QA testing, repeatedly fixing and packaging**. Once everything is confirmed, the feature is merged back into the main branch.

4. At the end of the Sprint, it's time to package and release to users; Developer Z **puts aside current tasks** to help package from the main branch for QA to perform Regression testing, similarly **going back and forth fixing issues and repackaging**, then finally submitting the packaged App for review.

5. Release to users after Apple/Google review is completed.

#### Problem

In the above story, we can summarize two major problems.

**Question 1: There is no unified inspection mechanism for current correct feature changes.**

- Code That Does Not Follow Coding Style Can Also Be Merged

- I Can Merge Even If the Build Fails

- Merges are allowed even if basic Unit Tests and key checks fail after changes

- My environment works correctly, but others' may not.

- Affecting other developers who are currently working

**Question 2: Spending a lot of manpower and time on packaging work.**

- Packaging requires engineers to manually package, interrupting their current development work

- Switching between packaging and development causes high cognitive switching costs

- Packaging wait time blocks other development tasks

- Engineers' time equals money

- Manual operations can lead to errors

- QA requests engineers to package (causing back-and-forth communication)

#### CI — Continuous Integration

Corresponding to Question 1, "Continuous Integration" aims to ensure that all changes automatically run Build & Test in a unified environment, making sure all modifications pass every test case and meet team standards before entering production — "continuously and automatically ensuring correct code integration into the production environment."

You can also add Nightly Builds and more automated testing steps to ensure stability.

#### CD — Continuous Delivery / Deployment

For Question 2, "Continuous Deployment" aims to automatically complete the packaging and deployment process after the code passes the CI stage without errors, delivering the changes to internal testing (QA, Debug, Staging, Beta…) or external release (Production, Release…).

- **Continuous Deployment:** Fully automated deployment directly to the Production environment

- **Continuous Delivery:** Automatically deploy only to the Staging/Debug environment; manual verification is required before deploying to the Production environment.

In the context of App development, it leans more towards **Continuous Delivery**, where we want a manual check to confirm everything is perfect before the App is officially released, ensuring the release timing and functionality are correct.

#### Story — **Building a Stable and Efficient Development Team through CI/CD**

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*rszgT5yFKCcfCUka_t9b3g.png)

**Looking back at our story, after implementing CI/CD:**

- CI  
  All changes must pass automated tests before merging into the main branch. A Nightly Build scheduled automated test is added to improve stability.

- CD  
  Using CD packaging uniformly, Developer T and Developer Z can fully focus on business development, reducing manual communication and operational errors.

> Team Work Efficiency and Product Stability 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

### The Value of CI/CD

Combining the core concept of agile development, "small steps, fast iterations," CI/CD provides the foundation for stability and work efficiency during frequent continuous feature iterations.

**Automated Unified Verification of Iteration Results**

- Ensure all adjustments meet the expected results, do not affect other functions, and do not impact other team members.

**Automate Tedious Deployment Processes**

- Allow team members to focus on core business development and reduce manual operation errors

#### The Effectiveness of CI/CD

Reviewing the 2021 Pinkoi talk "[**2021 Pinkoi Tech Career Talk — Secrets of High-Efficiency Engineering Teams**](../11f6c8568154/)," the content is basically the same: "automation, reducing human dependencies, and focusing on core business." Implementing CI/CD fully aligns with these three points, and we can use the same approach to estimate its effectiveness.

**Another point to highlight is the [cost of context switching](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BF%83%E6%B5%81%E7%90%86%E8%AB%96){:target="_blank"}:**

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*xOzjG-lSiFmdT-C4GHf0JA.png)

When we work continuously for a period, we enter a "flow" state where our thoughts and productivity peak, allowing us to produce the most effective output. However, if interrupted, it takes time to return to this flow state—here, we use 30 minutes as an example.

**In scenarios without CI/CD, it might be:** Spending a lot of time only to find out something was broken and then going back to communicate and adjust (CI), and QA/PM asking engineers to help package the test version of the app (CD).

#### CI/CD Effectiveness Estimation

![Team size: 6 people / Calculated over one month](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*SinoHlHKbtXiRubUS8Bm9Q.png)

Team size: 6 people / calculated on a monthly basis

Here, we use a monthly basis as an example. Without a CI/CD process, the main branch gets accidentally broken 4 times per month, causing about 720 minutes of fixing and communication costs. Adding the time spent on packaging test and release versions, plus errors from manual operations, totals around 1,010 minutes per month. Assuming an engineer's monthly salary is 80,000, this results in a cost waste of about 13,000 per month.

> *This part missed estimating [From 2026-03-01, Self-hosted will require a maintenance fee of $0.002 USD per minute](https://resources.github.com/actions/2026-pricing-changes-for-github-actions/){:target="_blank"}, which means running for 500 minutes costs $1 USD.*

#### CI/CD **Setup Cost**

- Labor Cost:  
  Based on this series of articles, it is estimated that 1 person spending 10 days = **4,800 minutes** can complete the setup. (~= **NT$36,384**)

- Device and Execution Costs:  
  Using GitHub Actions self-hosted Runner only requires purchasing 1–2 [Mac Mini](https://www.apple.com/tw/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini/m4){:target="_blank"} units initially or directly using existing retired MacBook Pros as CI/CD Runners for service.  
  For example, a 6-person team purchasing a brand new Mac Mini: 32G RAM M4 Mini (= **NT$40,900**)

The total cost is about **NT$80,000**, and benefits can be enjoyed after about six months.

> ***Disclaimer:*** *This is just one way to calculate benefits and may not be the most accurate; it is meant to give everyone a concept to expand on, **so that management can see the value of CI/CD** and authorize the implementation of the entire workflow.*

### Tool Selection for CI/CD

#### Cloud Services Bitrise / XCode Cloud

- **Bitrise:** One of the earliest cloud services focused on App CI/CD. My first experience with CI/CD was using Bitrise. It offers a user-friendly and intuitive step editor, allowing quick setup of App CI/CD workflows.  
  **Drawback:** Initially, it was a $99 flat fee. When Apple M-series processors were first released, they switched to usage-based billing (a "lock-in" strategy). At that time, our team’s usage cost at least $500 per month, so we migrated to GitHub Actions.  
  However, recently checking their website, they now offer 1 App / 1 Concurrent / unlimited usage for $89 per month.

- **XCode Cloud:** 100 hours / 1 month / $50 USD. The advantage is its deep integration with XCode and app development; however, the downside is that it does not support Android and customizing certain steps can be challenging. For small pure iOS apps, I would consider using it again.

> *Really afraid of **cloud services locking you in**, so prefer to have control in-house and consider on-premise solutions.*

#### On-Premise Services Jenkins / GitHub Actions / Gitlab CI/CD

- **Gitlab CI/CD:**  
  It was launched earlier and offers more complete features than GitHub Actions, but since our project is hosted on GitHub, we do not consider using Gitlab CI/CD. However, the functionalities are similar on both platforms, and this series will use GitHub Actions as an example.

- **GitHub Actions**  
  GitHub launched its CI/CD service in 2018, directly integrated with GitHub projects. It has continuously improved over the years, offering many pre-built steps ([Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions){:target="_blank"}) ready to use. It supports self-hosted runners, allowing unlimited use of your own machines (essentially a hybrid cloud).

- **Jenkins:**  
  An open-source, free tool specialized in CI/CD, old but powerful; it covers everything from application-level task design and permission management to low-level service dispatch and execution. Jenkins also has [Plugins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/){:target="_blank"} that can be used directly, making it an essential tool for early DevOps CI/CD.

### Jenkins v.s. GitHub Actions

#### **TL;DR**

> *For an App Team without dedicated DevOps, expecting app developers to build and maintain a Jenkins environment from scratch is too challenging. Few know how to do it, and it can cause network security issues. Choosing GitHub Actions instead allows app developers to focus solely on designing the CI/CD process. By briefly reviewing the official docs on writing workflows and starting Runners, they can quickly set up a free, stable, and secure CI/CD service.*

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*qg8SkzoJqNVvWPxx2Lh6uA.png)

> *The following comparison focuses solely on App CI/CD setup and does not apply to all technical scenarios.*

#### **Setup and Maintenance Difficulty** Jenkins &gt;&gt;&gt; GitHub Actions

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*k2XGXjV_VZEt618DnDm0lA.png)

Here is a simple layered diagram to explain the difference between the two. Jenkins, as mentioned before, covers all functions from top to bottom, making self-hosting much more complex. GitHub Actions, on the other hand, only requires writing YAML workflows on GitHub. The local machine just needs to register a GitHub self-hosted Runner (done with 5 commands), and GitHub will automatically dispatch tasks to the local machine. Other issues like GitHub Actions/Runner version upgrades or task dispatching are maintained by GitHub, so we don't need to handle them.

Another troublesome point is that Jenkins is a service independent of Git, so communication between them requires APIs (e.g., GitHub API/WebHook), making the setup more complicated.

I previously surveyed about 30 iOS developers around me. Only a few (2) understood Jenkins, while more than 10 were using GitHub Actions. After all, writing a simple YAML file can complete CI/CD tasks.

#### Learning Difficulty Jenkins >>> GitHub Actions

Refer only to the official documentation to learn GitHub Actions YAML commands and how to start your own Runner locally.

#### Stability: GitHub Actions > Jenkins

In this aspect, I think GitHub Actions slightly outperforms Jenkins.

Jenkins may crash due to system upgrades or installing conflicting plugins (but if it runs smoothly and you don't touch it, it generally has no issues).

GitHub Actions depends on [GitHub Service Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/){:target="_blank"} (if GitHub is down, Actions will be down too), but outages are rare, with an average uptime of 99.9%. If issues occur, just wait for them to be fixed.

#### Security: GitHub Actions > Jenkins

Considering that GitHub Actions/Runner is maintained and automatically updated by GitHub itself, it may be safer than Jenkins, which requires manual updates.

Additionally, communication between Jenkins and GitHub requires opening API/WebHook ports, which is relatively risky. GitHub and GitHub Actions integrate seamlessly, and the interaction between GitHub Actions and the self-hosted Runner follows an observer pattern. The self-hosted Runner actively requests tasks from GitHub, so the Runner itself does not need to expose any external interfaces.

However, in a fully closed network environment, Jenkins is more secure than GitHub Actions.

#### Permission Control Jenkins >>> GitHub Actions

This point needs special emphasis for comparison: Jenkins allows setting up separate account login permissions for control; GitHub Actions is directly tied to the GitHub repo, so only users with repo permissions can use it.

> **That is why the following article uses GAS Web App to build a cross-team operation platform.*

#### Moving from Jenkins to GitHub Actions for Scalability

In teams with a complete DevOps team, Jenkins is undoubtedly still the preferred choice. After all, in other fields (such as Web, backend, Java…), Jenkins has been running the longest, offers the most useful plugins, and can unify CI/CD services for all teams, making management easier. It also supports complex CI/CD scenarios like automatic frontend deployment after backend deployment.

> **GitHub Actions later also supported cross-repo Actions/Runners.**

#### Third-Party Plugin Richness Jenkins > GitHub Actions

In terms of quantity, GitHub Actions outnumbers Jenkins, but Jenkins offers deeper and more powerful CI/CD features. Many of GitHub Actions are simply automation functions.

#### Feature Depth Jenkins >>> GitHub Actions

This aspect is unmatched. Jenkins has been around for nearly 20 years, while GitHub Actions still needs to add many features; for example: permission management, secret management (currently only plain text is supported, key files must be converted to plain text first), Cache/Artifact currently only supports Cloud, and so on.

**Additionally, GitHub Self-hosted Runner also supports [Docker or k8s](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/runners/about-actions-runner-controller#scaling-runners){:target="_blank"}.**

#### Customizing Jenkins Deeply >>> GitHub Actions

Jenkins is fully controlled by yourself, allowing greater customization of permissions that can affect the entire system. GitHub Actions can only customize different steps at the application level.

For example, since the built-in Artifacts in GitHub Actions do not support self-hosted runners, you can only use a sh command in the workflow step to copy files to another directory, and cannot customize or implement Artifacts yourself.

> **App CI/CD scenarios do not require very advanced features.**

#### Usability GitHub Actions >>> Jenkins

On the interface side, GitHub Actions is a newer tool and is easier to use than Jenkins;  
In terms of script configuration, Jenkins uses Pipeline Scripts stored on Jenkins, while GitHub Actions uses YAML files managed with the project’s Git, making it easier to configure than Jenkins.

#### Cost Risk Jenkins > GitHub Actions

Jenkins is fully open-source and free to use, while GitHub Actions is partially open-source but its task dispatching and execution run on GitHub's closed SaaS platform. Currently, GitHub Actions is completely free; fees apply only when using GitHub-hosted Runners. Starting from 2026-03-01, using self-hosted Runners will also incur a maintenance fee of $0.002 USD per minute [source](https://resources.github.com/actions/2026-pricing-changes-for-github-actions/){:target="_blank"}. Public repositories have free usage quotas for these charges.

### Purpose of Google Apps Script Web App and Why It Was Chosen

Another tool option is Google Apps Script Web App. The reason for adding this is that GitHub Actions' built-in form feature is too basic (the interface is too technical and static) and its execution permissions are tied to the GitHub repo. This makes it very inconvenient if we need to provide access to other functional team members.

**As follows:**

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*kULMefCX5D6I5z9xt71A5A.png)

CD packaging usually requires the operator to fill in some information, such as Release Notes.

Therefore, we need an "interface" tool for other team members or even our own engineers to use more conveniently.

**Required Scenario:**

> *Fill in the required information on this more user-friendly "interface," connect to project management tools (e.g., Jira, Asana) to fetch tasks, or directly get the PR list from GitHub. Select from the dropdown menu and submit, then trigger GitHub Actions for packaging via the GitHub API.*

#### Slack

When first implementing CI/CD, we chose to integrate with the Slack API to achieve a similar effect:

![<https://slack.com/intl/zh-tw/blog/productivity/workflow-builder-tools-automation-examples>{:target="_blank"}](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*m85bTTlrwAmCxoVqVXo2fg.png)

<https://slack.com/intl/zh-tw/blog/productivity/workflow-builder-tools-automation-examples>{:target="_blank"}

- Partners can directly fill out forms in Slack, trigger CD packaging, and receive Slack notifications.

The operation is smooth and unified within daily office tools (SSOT), requiring no relearning; however, the underlying issue is that **development and maintenance costs are very high**. One reason is that Slack Outgoing-Webhook API demands a very fast response (within 3 seconds), which basically rules out using simple FAAS services for integration (e.g., Cloud Functions, GAS, Lambda…).

**Previously, a team member interested in automation and backend development built a complete backend service using Kotlin+ktor, then deployed a server on GCP for Slack integration.**

> ***Development and maintenance costs are very high and handover is difficult.***

#### Google Apps Script — Web App

Previously shared "[Using Google Apps Script Web App Form to Connect with Github Action CI/CD Workflow](../4cb4437818f2/)":

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*Gr4PnV2J2AB9cVFuXMLjcA.png)

![[Demo Web App Form URL](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwNW6N5ozKbIz_E1HK6yFEUtA8KQrUciS-jcPsQptvIKlARmKgLxbQzNu8ksVeg-BmEfg/exec){:target="_blank"}](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*NJRcY2ULVylZlsKnBtM27A.png)

[Demo Web App Form URL](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwNW6N5ozKbIz_E1HK6yFEUtA8KQrUciS-jcPsQptvIKlARmKgLxbQzNu8ksVeg-BmEfg/exec){:target="_blank"}

**The advantages of using Google Apps Script — Web App are:**

- Website Web

- Similar to Google Workspace enterprise account permission management, access can be restricted to only Google accounts within the organization.

- **Completely Free**

- **Function as a Service requires no self-hosted server maintenance**

- Easier to maintain and hand over

- Can be operated on mobile devices

- **AI Can Help!**  
  **Whether it's ChatGPT or other AI tools, they are very familiar with GAS and can directly help us create packaging forms and connect to the GitHub API.**

- Can also integrate with Jira, Asana, and Slack notification APIs

For the second rollout, I switched to using a GAS Web App for the team, which also received great feedback. The only difference from Slack is that you need to bookmark one more URL, and when packaging is needed, you open the URL and operate the packaging through the web form.

### Complete App CI/CD Tool Workflow

Here is the complete workflow. In the next article, I will gradually explain how to use and integrate each tool.

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*pQ-2Jj6s2qlvwTrLghJSjg.png)

#### Tool Roles:

- **GitHub Actions** : CI/CD workflow script code

- **GitHub Actions — Self-hosted Runner**: The actual environment where CI/CD runs. Using a self-hosted runner, you only need to pay for the machine purchase and can run tasks with unlimited usage.

- **Google Apps Script Web App**: Since packaging is not always done by engineers, a platform is needed for cross-functional partners to use; GAS Web App can quickly create a web tool and share the URL for others to operate.

- **Asana/Jira**: Project management tools that can integrate with the GAS Web App, allowing QA/PM to directly select the tasks they want to package.

- **Slack** : Responsible for receiving execution result notifications

#### Scenario:

- End-User (QA/PM/PD/Developer): Submit the packaging form using GAS Web App (fetch the Branch corresponding to the Jira or Asana task) -> GAS calls GitHub API -> triggers CD packaging Github Actions <- GitHub self-hosted runner listens for the task and pulls it to the machine for execution -> upon completion, Slack notification is sent and GAS Web App packaging status is updated.

- End-User (Developer): Open a PR, push a new commit to the PR -> trigger the CI test process <- GitHub self-hosted runner listens for the task and pulls it to the machine for execution -> after completion, comment test results and update Checks.

### Summary

This article mainly provides an introduction to what CI/CD is and the benefits it brings. Starting from the next article, we will dive into the technical aspects, guiding you step-by-step to understand and implement GitHub Actions CI/CD until achieving the final result mentioned earlier.
