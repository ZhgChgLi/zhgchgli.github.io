#### Introduction

After going through the experience of building App CI/CD in two different development teams, I finally found some time to organize my thoughts on the journey from "why do it" to "how to do it." I can't guarantee that this is the most standard CI/CD workflow, but it is definitely a worthwhile starting point to help your team begin implementation, enhance product stability, and improve overall development efficiency.
#### Chapters

This series of articles will start with "What is CI/CD and what value does it bring?" Then, we will go step by step through "How to set up a CI/CD environment using GitHub Actions + self-hosted Runner" and "Implementing CI and CD in App development." Finally, I will introduce how to "Use AI Vibe Coding Google Apps Script Web App combined with GitHub Actions to create a convenient app packaging platform for cross-team use." I hope this series will be helpful to you.

- Google Apps Script Web App (CD packaging interface) allows engineers, QA, and PMs to package the app on computers or mobile devices.
- CI/CD â€” All developed using GitHub Actions, easy to maintain and expand.
- GitHub Actions Self-hosted Runner uses your own machine for unlimited CI/CD usage.
- Integrates with Firebase App Distribution API to directly obtain download links for packaged test versions.

### What is CI/CD?
#### Story â€” Development Process Without CI/CD

Before discussing what CI/CD is, let's set aside the term "CI/CD" and recall how a startup development team without any established workflow would operate. The process can be summarized in the following diagram:

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*FHKyuk2C8THOD697wkVekQ.png)

1. A product has a bug, Developer T creates a branch fix/bug-c from the main branch to fix it, and after fixing, merges it back to the main branch.
2. Immediately after, Developer Z creates a branch feature/a from the main branch for Requirement A, but halfway through realizes something is wrong with the functionality. **Upon checking, they discover that the current functionality has been broken and the tests are also failing**, and they notify Developer T to make corrections.
3. Once all development is completed, Developer Z **packages the version for QA testing on their computer, going back and forth to fix and package**. After confirming everything is fine, they merge the functionality back to the main branch.
4. As the sprint comes to an end, they need to package a release for users; Developer Z **puts aside their current work** to assist in packaging from the main branch for QA to conduct regression testing, similarly **going back and forth to fix issues and repackage**, and after completion, submits the package for review to the App Store.
5. After Apple/Google reviews, it is released to users.

#### Problems

From the above story, we can summarize two major issues.

**Question 1: There is no unified check mechanism for current correct functionality changes.**
- Code that does not conform to the coding style can still be merged.
- Even if it doesn't build, I can still merge.
- Changes that fail basic unit tests and important checks can still be merged.
- My environment may work correctly, but others may not.
- It affects others who are currently developing.

**Question 2: A significant amount of manpower is wasted on packaging work.**
- Packaging requires engineers to manually package, interrupting current development work.
- The cost of switching between packaging and development is extremely high.
- Waiting time for packaging prevents other development work from being done.
- The time cost of engineers is money.
- Manual operations may lead to errors.
- QA needs to ask engineers to package (back and forth communication).

#### CI â€” Continuous Integration

In response to Question 1, "Continuous Integration" aims to ensure that all changes can automatically execute builds and tests in a unified environment, ensuring that changes pass all test cases and meet team standards before entering the production environment â€” "continuously and automatically ensuring the correct code is integrated into the production environment."

Additionally, it can include Nightly Builds and more automated testing processes to ensure stability.
#### CD â€” Continuous Delivery / Deployment

In response to Question 2, "Continuous Deployment" aims to ensure that after the CI phase shows no abnormalities, the results of changes are automatically packaged and deployed through cumbersome processes for internal testing (QA, Debug, Staging, Betaâ€¦) or external release (Production, Releaseâ€¦).
- **Continuous Deployment:** Fully automated direct deployment to the Production environment.
- **Continuous Delivery:** Automatically deploys to Staging/Debug environments, requiring manual verification before deploying to the Production environment.

In the context of app development, it leans more towards **Continuous Delivery**, as we want to ensure that the app is fully verified by humans before release, ensuring the accuracy of release timing and functionality.
#### Story â€” **Building a Stable and Efficient Development Team through CI/CD**

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*wUwtvrN5Gwg5_slKc_QwFQ.png)

**Looking back at our story, after implementing CI/CD:**
- CI
All adjustments must pass automated testing verification before entering the main branch, and Nightly Builds are added for regular automated testing to enhance stability.
- CD
Unified CD packaging allows Developer T and Developer Z to fully focus on business development, reducing manual communication and operational errors.

> Team efficiency and product stability ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ 

### The Value of CI/CD

Combining the core concept of agile development "small steps, fast iterations," CI/CD provides the foundation for stability and work efficiency during "frequent continuous feature iterations."

**Automated Unified Verification of Iteration Results**
- Ensures all adjustments meet the correct expected results, do not affect other functionalities, and do not impact other team members.

**Automated Execution of Cumbersome Deployment Processes**
- Allows team members to focus on primary business development, reducing manual operational errors.

#### The Effectiveness of CI/CD

Reflecting on the 2021 talk at Pinkoi, "[**2021 Pinkoi Tech Career Talk â€” Secrets of High-Efficiency Engineering Teams**](../11f6c8568154/)," the content is essentially the same, revolving around "automation, reducing reliance on individuals, and focusing on primary business." Implementing CI/CD aligns perfectly with these three directions, allowing us to estimate effectiveness in the same way.

**Another point to highlight is the [cost of switching tasks](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BF%83%E6%B5%81%E7%90%86%E8%AB%96){:target="_blank"}:** 

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*xOzjG-lSiFmdT-C4GHf0JA.png)

When we continuously engage in work for a period, we enter a "flow" state, where our thoughts and productivity peak, allowing for the most effective output. However, if interrupted, it takes time to return to that flow, which can be around 30 minutes.

**In a scenario without CI/CD, it might be:** Spending a lot of time only to discover that something was broken and then going back to communicate adjustments (CI), and having QA/PM ask engineers to help package the test version of the app (CD).
#### Estimating CI/CD Effectiveness

![Team size of 6 people / Calculated over one month](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*GmqLhcAxHEfYwN_D7sjMnA.png)

Team size of 6 people / Calculated over one month

Here, we base it on a monthly basis, assuming that without CI/CD processes, there would be 4 instances per month of accidentally breaking the main branch, leading to subsequent correction and communication costs, totaling about 720 minutes; plus the time spent packaging test versions, official versions, and potential errors caused by manual operations, totaling approximately 1,010 minutes; with an engineer's monthly salary of 80,000, this results in about 13,000 in wasted costs each month.
#### CI/CD **Implementation Costs**
- Labor Costs:
Based on the construction outlined in this series of articles, it is estimated that 1 person would need to invest 10 days = **4,800 minutes** to complete it. \(~= **NT$36,384** \)
- Equipment and Execution Costs:
Using GitHub Actions self-hosted Runner only requires the procurement of 1â€“2 [Mac Mini](https://www.apple.com/tw/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini/m4){:target="_blank"} or directly using existing replaced MacBook Pros to serve as CI/CD Runners.
Taking the example of purchasing a brand new Mac Mini for a 6-person team: 32G RAM M4 Mini \(= **NT$40,900** \)

The total cost is approximately **NT$80,000**, allowing for completion of the setup, with benefits starting about six months later.
### Tool Selection for CI/CD
#### Cloud Services Bitrise / XCode Cloud
- **Bitrise:** The earliest cloud service focused on providing App CI/CD. My first encounter with CI/CD was also through Bitrise, which offers a user-friendly step editing tool to quickly set up App CI/CD processes.
**Cons:** Initially priced at $99 per month for unlimited usage, when the Apple M series processors were first released, it switched to usage-based billing ( **"bait and switch"** ), and at that time, it was estimated that the team's usage would cost at least $500 per month, so we migrated to GitHub Actions.
However, I recently checked their website, and they now offer 1 App / 1 Concurrent / unlimited usage for $89 per month.
- **XCode Cloud:** 100 hours / 1 month / $50, with the advantage of being highly integrated with XCode and app development; however, the downside is that it does not support Android, and customizing some steps can be challenging; but if it's a small iOS-only app, I would reconsider using it directly.

> _I am really afraid of **cloud services having hidden costs**, and I hope to have control in my hands, so I am considering on-premises services._ 

#### On-Premises Services Jenkins / GitHub Actions / Gitlab CI/CD
- **Gitlab CI/CD:** 
Launched earlier than GitHub Actions and has more complete features, but since our project is hosted on GitHub, we won't consider using Gitlab CI/CD; however, the functionalities are similar, and this series of articles will use GitHub Actions as an example.
- **GitHub Actions** 
Launched by GitHub in 2018, this CI/CD service is directly tied to GitHub projects and has continuously updated and improved features over the years, with many pre-packaged steps available in the [Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions){:target="_blank"} for direct use; it supports self-hosted runners that allow unlimited use of your own machines. \(essentially a hybrid cloud\)
- **Jenkins:** 
An open-source free tool specifically for handling CI/CD, old but powerful; from application layer task design, permission management to underlying service dispatch execution, Jenkins covers it all; it also has [Plugins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/){:target="_blank"} that can be used directly, making it an essential tool for early DevOps CI/CD.

### Jenkins vs. GitHub Actions
#### **TL;DR**

> _For an App Team without dedicated DevOps, having app developers set up and maintain a Jenkins environment from scratch is too high a barrier, and few people know how to do it, which can also lead to network security issues; choosing to use GitHub Actions directly allows app developers to focus solely on CI/CD process design, quickly setting up a free, stable, and secure CI/CD service by just reviewing the official documentation on how to write and start a Runner._ 

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*qg8SkzoJqNVvWPxx2Lh6uA.png)

> _The following comparison is based solely on setting up App CI/CD and may not apply to all technical scenarios._ 

#### **Ease of Setup and Maintenance** Jenkins >>> GitHub Actions

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*7Quxx3LronhoOs8nyMzziw.png)

Here, I will use a not-so-professional structural diagram to explain the differences between the two. As mentioned, Jenkins covers everything from top to bottom, making self-hosting much more complex; whereas GitHub Actions only requires writing YAML workflows on GitHub, and the local machine only needs to register the GitHub self-hosted Runner (which can be completed in 5 commands), and GitHub will automatically dispatch tasks to the local machine for execution. Other aspects, including GitHub Actions/Runner version upgrades or task dispatch issues, are maintained by GitHub, so we do not need to handle them.

Another more troublesome point is that Jenkins operates independently of Git, requiring communication through APIs (e.g., GitHub API/WebHook), which complicates the setup further.

I previously conducted a survey among about 30 iOS developers I could reach, and only a few (2) knew Jenkins, while over 10 were using GitHub Actions, as it only requires writing YAML to complete CI/CD tasks.
#### Learning Difficulty Jenkins >>> GitHub Actions

As mentioned, you only need to refer to the official documentation to learn how to use GitHub Actions with YAML commands and how to start your own Runner locally.
#### Stability GitHub Actions > Jenkins

I believe GitHub Actions has a slight edge over Jenkins in this regard.

date: 2023-10-01

Jenkins may crash due to system upgrades or conflicts with installed plugins (however, if it runs smoothly and is not tampered with, there should be no issues).

GitHub Actions is subject to [GitHub service status](https://www.githubstatus.com/){:target="_blank"} (if GitHub goes down, it will also be affected), but this happens infrequently, maintaining an average uptime of 99.9%; if problems do arise, there's no need to intervene, just wait for a fix.
#### Security: GitHub Actions > Jenkins

Considering that the GitHub Actions/Runner service is maintained and automatically updated by GitHub, it may be more secure than Jenkins, which requires manual updates.

Additionally, Jenkins needs to open API/WebHook ports for communication with GitHub, which is relatively risky. In contrast, GitHub integrates seamlessly with GitHub Actions, and GitHub Actions communicates with self-hosted Runners in an observer mode, where the Runner requests tasks from GitHub, meaning it does not need to open external interfaces.

However, in a fully closed network environment, Jenkins would be more secure than GitHub Actions.
#### Permission Control: Jenkins >>> GitHub Actions

This point needs to be highlighted for comparison; Jenkins allows for separate account login permissions for control, while GitHub Actions is directly tied to the GitHub Repo, requiring repo permissions for access.

> _*This is why the following articles will use GAS Web App to build a cross-team operational platform._ 

#### Usage Scope: Jenkins >>> GitHub Actions

In a complete DevOps team, it is unquestionable that Jenkins would still be the preferred choice, as it has been running the longest in other fields (such as web, backend, Java, etc.), with the most plugins available and the best usability. It can also unify the CI/CD service for all teams, making management easier, or handle complex CI/CD scenarios like automatically deploying the frontend after backend deployment.

> _*GitHub Actions later also supported cross-repo Actions/Runners._ 

#### Richness of Third-Party Plugins: Jenkins > GitHub Actions

In terms of quantity, GitHub Actions has more than Jenkins, but Jenkins' CI/CD capabilities are deeper and more powerful, while many GitHub Actions are merely automation features.
#### Depth of Functionality: Jenkins >>> GitHub Actions

This is an area where Jenkins cannot be compared; it has been around for nearly 20 years, while GitHub Actions still has many features to catch up on, such as: permission management, secret management (currently limited to plain text; key files must be converted to plain text), no auto-scaling runners (must be implemented via API), runner weight settings, etc.
#### Customization Depth: Jenkins >>> GitHub Actions

Jenkins allows complete control over customization, with greater permissions that can affect the entire system. GitHub Actions can only customize different steps at the application layer.

For example, the built-in artifacts in GitHub Actions do not support self-hosted runners, so the only option is to change the step to `sh copy` to another directory, without the ability to customize artifacts.

> _*App CI/CD scenarios do not require overly complex features._ 

#### Usability: GitHub Actions >>> Jenkins

In terms of interface, GitHub Actions is a newer tool that is easier to use than Jenkins; in terms of script configuration, Jenkins uses Pipeline Script stored on Jenkins, while GitHub Actions uses YAML files managed with Git, making it easier to set up than Jenkins.
#### Cost Risk: Jenkins > GitHub Actions

Jenkins is fully open-source and free, with control in hand, while GitHub Actions is partially open-source but task distribution and execution are part of GitHub's closed SaaS service. Currently, the policy is that GitHub Actions is completely free, but using GitHub Runner incurs costs (for private repos), while using self-hosted runners is free.
### Purpose of Google Apps Script Web App and Why It Was Chosen

Another tool choice is Google Apps Script Web App. The reason for needing this is that the form functionality provided by GitHub Actions is too basic (the interface is too technical and only static) and the execution permissions are tied to the GitHub Repo, making it very cumbersome if we need to provide it for other functional partners.

**As follows:**

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*kULMefCX5D6I5z9xt71A5A.png)

For CD packaging, we would like the operator to fill in some information, such as Release Notes.

Therefore, we need a "interface" tool to provide for other partners or even for our engineers to use more conveniently.

**Required Scenario:**

> _Fill in the required information on this more user-friendly "interface," connect to project management tools (e.g., Jira, Asana) to retrieve tasks or directly obtain the PR list from GitHub, select from a dropdown menu, and submit, then trigger GitHub Actions for packaging via the GitHub API._ 

#### Slack

When we first introduced CI/CD, we chose to integrate with the Slack API to achieve effects similar to the following:

![[https://slack\.com/intl/zh\-tw/blog/productivity/workflow\-builder\-tools\-automation\-examples](https://slack.com/intl/zh-tw/blog/productivity/workflow-builder-tools-automation-examples){:target="_blank"}](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*m85bTTlrwAmCxoVqVXo2fg.png)

[https://slack\.com/intl/zh\-tw/blog/productivity/workflow\-builder\-tools\-automation\-examples](https://slack.com/intl/zh-tw/blog/productivity/workflow-builder-tools-automation-examples){:target="_blank"}
- Partners can directly use forms in Slack to fill in information, trigger CD packaging, and receive Slack notifications.

The operation is smooth and unified within daily office tools (SSOT), requiring no relearning; however, the underlying issue is that **the development and maintenance costs are very high**, one reason being that the Slack Outgoing-Webhook API has very high response requirements (needs to respond within 3 seconds), which essentially rules out the use of FAAS services for simple integration (e.g., Cloud Functions, GAS, Lambdaâ€¦).

**Previously, a partner who was very interested in automation and backend developed a complete backend service using Kotlin+ktor, and then set up a server on GCP for Slack integration.**

> **_The development and maintenance costs are extremely high and difficult to hand over._** 

#### Google Apps Script â€” Web App

Previously, I shared "[Using Google Apps Script Web App Forms to Integrate GitHub Action CI/CD Work](../4cb4437818f2/)":

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*Gr4PnV2J2AB9cVFuXMLjcA.png)

![Demo Web App Form URL](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*NJRcY2ULVylZlsKnBtM27A.png)

Demo Web App Form URL

**The advantages of using Google Apps Script â€” Web App are:**
- Same Google Workspace enterprise account permission management, can set access to only Google accounts within the organization
- **Completely free**
- **Function as a Service without needing to set up and maintain servers**
- Easier to maintain and hand over
- Can be operated on mobile
- **AI Can Help!** 
**Whether it's ChatGPT or other AI tools, they are very familiar with GAS and can directly assist us in creating packaging forms and integrating with the GitHub API**
- Can also connect to Jira, Asana, Slack notification APIs.

For the second promotion, I switched to using GAS Web App for partners, and received very positive feedback. The only difference from Slack is that you need to remember one more URL to bookmark; when packaging is needed, just open the URL and operate the packaging from the web form.
### Complete Tool Workflow for App CI/CD

Here is the complete workflow, and the next article will gradually introduce how to use and integrate each tool.

![](/assets/c008a9e8ceca/1*1puKPXp2bZRB7pBgxuEy-Q.png)

#### Tool Roles:
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD logic script code
- **GitHub Actions â€” Self-hosted Runner**: The actual execution place for CI/CD, using a self-hosted Runner to execute, only needing to bear the cost of purchasing the machine, allowing unlimited task execution.
- **Google Apps Script Web App**: Since packaging may not always be the responsibility of engineers, a platform is needed for cross-functional partners to use; GAS Web App can quickly create a web tool and share the URL for others to operate.
- **Asana/Jira**: Project management tools that can connect with GAS Web App, allowing QA/PM to directly select tasks to be packaged.
- **Slack**: Responsible for receiving execution result notifications.

#### Scenarios:
- End-User (QA/PM/PD/Developer): Uses GAS Web App to submit the packaging form (fetching the corresponding branch for Jira or Asana task) -> GAS calls GitHub API -> triggers CD packaging in GitHub Actions <- GitHub self-hosted runner listens for the task and pulls it back to the machine for execution -> upon completion, Slack notifies and updates the GAS Web App packaging status.
- End-User (Developer): Opens PR, pushes new commits to PR -> triggers CI testing process <- GitHub self-hosted runner listens for the task and pulls it back to the machine for execution -> upon completion, comments on test results and updates checks.

#### Final Results:
