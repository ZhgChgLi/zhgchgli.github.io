### \[Travelogue\] 9/11 One-Day Flash Trip to Nagoya

Peach Aviation's one-day flash trip ticket experience to Nagoya

### Background

The one-day round-trip ticket to Nagoya is a promotion launched by Peach Aviation:

At that time, I purchased the round-trip ticket to Nagoya, including airport service fees, for `$5,600`, **no checked baggage, no meals, no seat selection**; both flights were red-eye flights:
- Outbound: TPE 02:25 \-&gt; NGO 06:30
- Return: NGO 23:15 \-&gt; TPE 01:25


According to the official promotional materials, **the maximum stay time is 16 hours and 45 minutes**!

Carry-on baggage regulations: **two pieces per person & total weight less than 7 kilograms**

#### Visit Japan

To expedite entry, I filled out the entry information in advance, and I could complete the entry procedures directly using the QR code:

- Here, I filled in the stay duration as 1 day, and for the contact information in Japan, I directly provided the information for Chubu Centrair International Airport. I wasn't questioned and passed through safely!

### Summary (Written in Advance)

The one-day flash trip is a test of physical and mental endurance; I originally planned to sleep while waiting for the flight or on the plane, but since the waiting time was too early, I couldn't sleep. Once on the plane, the seats were too small, I didn't get a window seat, and the engine noise was very loud, so I didn't really sleep at all, which meant I was awake all night. After landing at 6:00, I started my itinerary in Nagoya; I was so tired that I ended up napping for over half an hour in a café at Nagoya Tower (quiet, not many people).


Time and attractions are limited, so I can't go too far.

In addition to the body's battery, the phone's battery is also a major challenge; I brought a 20,000 mAh Xiaomi power bank to complete the entire itinerary (which charged my iPhone 13 about 4–5 times).

I returned to Taiwan around 2–3 AM, and there was no public transportation, so I had to take a taxi back to Taipei.

For a few hundred dollars more, you can choose a window seat, and it's better to prepare a neck pillow and earplugs for a better sleep.
### Departure
#### 9/10 PM 22:03 — Arrived at Taoyuan Airport MRT A1 Taipei Station, took the 22:15 direct train to Terminal 1


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*dnSVLmlJGYdrhTGIIszerQ.png)

#### 9/10 PM 10:55 — Arrived at the departure hall of Terminal 1


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*hqBq_mPwADgJVgiyTySVJA.png)


I arrived too early; the check-in counter opened at 23:55 (even though I didn't have checked luggage, I couldn't check in online for some reason, so I had to wait for the counter to open).

With an hour to go before check-in, I decided to head back to B1 Food Court to find a place to rest; by 11 PM, all the shops in the food court were closed (including convenience stores), and I couldn't buy anything to eat.
#### 9/11 AM 00:09 — Completed departure


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*hgsHsAqRPmS42NW3Lvt0_Q.png)


The check-in counter opened early, and when I returned to the departure hall at 11:40, I saw that check-in had started; without checked luggage and just carrying a backpack, I quickly completed the check-in, security check, and departure.

Starting from 9/11, the official countdown begins—24 hours!
#### 9/11 AM 00:12 — Wandering around Terminal 1


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*tT0HjtgmHi38ys5yK6j3TQ.jpeg)


It's worth mentioning that Terminal 1 has a free lounge area; just follow the signs to the lounge, and you'll get there. The environment and seating are similar to a café, and there are shower facilities (open from AM 6 to PM 10); for more details, you can refer to [this article](https://stancy.tw/airport-lounge/){:target="_blank"}.

The lounge area is actually better for sleeping because you can lie down... but I only passed by and took a quick look before starting to search for places in the airport that sell food (since there was no in-flight meal). As expected, it was too late, and everything was closed. In the end, I only found a vending machine that sold cookies, so I bought a pack of I-Mei cream puffs and a can of tea.
#### 9/11 AM 00:45 — Waiting at the boarding gate


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*bUf08uTaKk9ecZZShKP1fA.png)



![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*LAFV5rJcrW9aq2HcOL7xcw.png)


I really arrived too early; there weren't many people in the waiting room. The chairs are arranged in pairs, making it difficult to lie down and sleep (it looked awkward, so I got up after taking the photo). Sleeping upright was uncomfortable, and the air conditioning in the waiting room was very cold. However, I was still relatively alert at that time and didn't feel sleepy. As time went on, more and more people arrived, and the noise level increased, making it even harder to sleep. So, I just closed my eyes to conserve energy and flipped through some basic Japanese (hiragana), thinking I would catch some sleep on the plane.
#### 9/11 AM 02:14 — Completed boarding


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*urxHjZKt6pP7cZlJSYE7fw.png)


The flight was slightly delayed; boarding was originally scheduled for 01:55 but was delayed by 10 minutes. I finally completed boarding at 02:15.
#### 9/11 AM 02:26 — The plane took off


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*utaf6ccP3yAzTMWB0YbN_A.jpeg)


The seat was very small, with no headrest by the aisle. Fortunately, I brought a neck pillow for some support, but the engine noise and neck strain meant I hardly slept at all, and we bounced all the way to Nagoya. There was also no screen on the plane showing the flight distance, making the time feel very long.


> If I had to choose again, I would pay a few hundred dollars more for a window seat; one, because it’s easier to sleep with a place to rest my head, and two, because I could see the sunrise from the window when we arrived in Japan in the morning!!




#### 9/11 AM 06:20 — Arrived at Chubu Centrair International Airport, Nagoya


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*prYbU60HuhHIVpPm0kvszw.png)

#### 9/11 AM 06:35 — Completed immigration


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*BqtD5pBEWJrLAM5JaD4lDg.jpeg)


It probably took less than 15 minutes from landing to immigration due to the early hour and not needing to collect luggage. However, the weather was not favorable, as it was raining heavily in Nagoya.
#### 9/11 AM 7:03 — Waiting for the bus to Nagoya city


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*J85ZhklkjVsbi8NVG6Y8uA.jpeg)



![One image shows seat information, and the other shows the ticket for the machine.](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*3mfOkpdDFjb7BziVaaezRg.jpeg)


One is the seating information and the other is the ticket for entry (for the machine).

> [_KKday Chubu Centrair International Airport NGO ⇆ Nagoya Station | Meitetsu Airport Limited Express Train Electronic Ticket_](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20418-chubu-centrair-international-airport-express-train-transfer-to-nagoya?cid=19365&ud1=9da2c51fa4f2){:target="_blank"} 

I first bought a one-way ticket from Chubu International Airport to Nagoya Railway + uSky train ($271) online, thinking that since I was there, I might as well try the latest and best train; it has reserved seating, is very stable and comfortable, and is a limited express train.

However, if you want to save money and be more convenient, you can actually buy a semi-express ticket on-site or just enter the station and take a regular train; attached is the train schedule and stops, or you can check directly from the [Meitetsu website](https://trainbus.meitetsu.co.jp/meitetsu-transfer-zh-tw/pc/map/Top){:target="_blank"}:

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*9UM0s_DJ8p9S4Rijxcno_w.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*Yu_6S8qQnLUfOlmByzWb_w.jpeg)

#### First Destination: [Konparu Osu コンパル 大須本店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZuXeeyb527htfdc17){:target="_blank"} for Fried Shrimp Toast

You need to get off at Kanayama (NH34) and transfer to `Meijo Line` to go to Kamimaezu Station.
#### 9/11 AM 8:00 Arrive at [Konparu Osu コンパル 大須本店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZuXeeyb527htfdc17){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*BEhfcQEMNhmKAEICAAl-oQ.jpeg)

The doors open at 8 o'clock, and there is completely no one early in the morning; the nearby Osu shopping street is also not open for business.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*fvZ_c7ZSFzEq_5weXS3S-A.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*_bj9uvgvGuOyquI7sBCToQ.jpeg)

Coffee is a must, after all, I hadn't slept all night; the shrimp in the fried shrimp toast is really cut from whole shrimp, and you can taste the bounce of the shrimp meat.
#### Second Destination: [Nagoya Castle](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UrJUoP5CSaXT9PBPA){:target="_blank"}

Nagoya Castle opens at 9:00, and other attractions do not open that early. It's also very close and convenient to go from Kamimaezu Station, so I went to Nagoya Castle first.
#### 9/11 AM 9:02 Arrive at [Nagoya Castle](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UrJUoP5CSaXT9PBPA){:target="_blank"}

After eating, I set off and arrived at Nagoya Castle Station around 9:02.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*ARhQGgrg3FGmc9H78qhnZA.jpeg)

Upon exiting the station, I found that it was pouring rain outside. I didn't expect it to rain in Japan and didn't bring an umbrella; the area was very empty, and I couldn't find a convenience store. Finally, I found a FamilyMart in the underground shopping area of Nagoya Castle Station, across from Nagoya City Hall, where I bought an umbrella and continued to Nagoya Castle!

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*p8s-2KUc357TIu83Q8DzHw.jpeg)

As I walked into Nagoya Castle, the rain eased a bit, but the main keep was under maintenance and not open, so I could only visit the splendid Honmaru Palace next door.

![Honmaru Palace](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*s6ReFycKcyd06J9DqWOL6Q.jpeg)

Honmaru Palace

You need to take off your shoes and store your bag (free, but you need a 100 yen coin).
#### Third Destination: [Chubu Electric Power MIRAI TOWER (formerly Nagoya TV Tower)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8eHMMb6MJ4fxZY3u9){:target="_blank"}

It's located at the lower right corner of Nagoya Castle, about 2 stations away; I took a bus to go there after leaving Nagoya Castle.
#### 9/11 AM 10:08 — Arrive at [Chubu Electric Power MIRAI TOWER (formerly Nagoya TV Tower)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8eHMMb6MJ4fxZY3u9){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*jBdGgsT8a4JR3gxGP0VVDA.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*QLSn1QzIhtBhm10LyjQNbA.jpeg)

The weather was partly cloudy and partly sunny; it turned sunny when we arrived and cloudy again when we left.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*Zbvx-RhT1QcaOYsgkrROFg.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*j_Ovwa7Q9xob5m-Vo1Zt7A.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*siU1IitFVrI6Dsyp1dZhNw.jpeg)

After buying tickets, you can go up to the observation deck to overlook Nagoya City (if you only want to go to the café on the middle floor, you don't need to buy a ticket; the café also offers some views).

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*WK28lGWl7B0HzdDbfk92cw.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*_QCwAszlLTUNygpELmlBLA.jpeg)

The café had a nice view, and as it approached 10:30, drowsiness began to set in; I ended up dozing off until after 11 o'clock. There were plenty of seats, it was quiet, and it was just perfect for catching up on sleep.

#### Third Destination: [Oasis 21](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6TM1nshDh3kupwRa6){:target="_blank"}

Oasis 21 is right outside Nagoya Tower, but due to the rain, it being a weekday, and the morning time, there wasn't much to explore, so we just took a quick look and left.

#### Fourth Destination: [Yabacho Yaba-cho Main Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/91JsWCJPoW2YtjVE8){:target="_blank"}

As noon approached, I thought about trying Nagoya's famous miso pork cutlet. The main store is about one or two stops away from Nagoya Tower, so I decided to walk.

#### Fifth Destination: [Osu Shopping District](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ErxDxS57PC1g6qyH9){:target="_blank"}

When I arrived, I found a long line… time was precious, and since I was close to the Osu Shopping District, I continued walking to find something to eat.

#### 9/11 PM 12:09 — Arrived at [Osu Shopping District](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ErxDxS57PC1g6qyH9){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*KYRHaxHf_k_hZ22FV6TGeQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*BJVGUsAga5PLkcz6tc6iVQ.jpeg)

I walked towards Osu Kannon, and just before reaching it, I found another branch of [Shiba's](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HaHhChfzKLmvZaoBA){:target="_blank"} and went in to dine.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*c91mg_omphyNGDB6etwAHA.jpeg)

I mindlessly ordered a set meal and realized I had ordered the wrong thing; I mainly wanted the miso pork cutlet in the upper left corner. The set included miso pork cutlet + fried sandfish + tsukudani + side dishes + soup + rice; the miso pork cutlet was delicious but too small—I didn't have enough!

#### Sixth Destination: [Osu Kannon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XepPPJRip3Tjk2ah6){:target="_blank"}

Right outside this restaurant is Osu Kannon.

#### 9/11 PM 13:05 — Arrived at [Osu Kannon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XepPPJRip3Tjk2ah6){:target="_blank"}

The main hall was under renovation, so I just strolled around outside before leaving.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*nhLITNzWqv3fc7FtFED3vQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*xgwH7Q8SKUNrxPyAD8m6Hw.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*gDPttxHlcEqdCTjojsaFPw.jpeg)

If you're afraid of birds, don't come here; there are many pigeons outside, and you can buy feed to feed them.

#### Seventh Destination: [Atsuta Shrine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VhuvdRMq2R59sted7){:target="_blank"}

I walked through the Osu Shopping District again, returned to the Meijo Line, and headed to Atsuta Shrine.

On the way, I bought some Benzaiten fruit daifuku to eat; the skin was thin and tender, and the fruit was fresh and juicy. I bought two to eat at once! (I think it's better than the one from Suisan XD)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*DN_R7bcD9_PzMpBmYkK8GQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*dKEMtwKNcdw-oGVBG-c3qw.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*z2b7AWIcBsuTSj7D5m43lQ.jpeg)

I also made a simple purchase of some over-the-counter medications at the drugstore in the shopping district to bring back to Taiwan.

#### 9/11 PM 13:35 — Arrived at [Atsuta Shrine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VhuvdRMq2R59sted7){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*LO20Srhkqp684_gIe34Akw.jpeg)

After exiting at Atsuta Jingu Station on the Meijo Line, you need to walk a bit further to reach the main entrance of Atsuta Jingu Shrine.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*WZ0mt0OMp1dvdOX9rkFKTA.jpeg)

After a brief visit, I bought some amulets and left.
#### 8th Destination: [Meitetsu Nagoya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rZZB2UMYgoLPqEeC8){:target="_blank"} Shopping

The last stop was to stroll around Meitetsu (by this time, I was already quite tired).
#### 9/11 PM 14:40 — Arrived at [Meitetsu Nagoya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rZZB2UMYgoLPqEeC8){:target="_blank"}

After wandering around the underground shopping area, I headed towards the JR GATE TOWER and went up to [Starbucks on the 15th floor](https://www.bigfang.tw/blog/post/jrgatetower-starbucks-nagoya){:target="_blank"} where there was a free view to enjoy.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*BUk_IIz5Ug7QkVBihLnL0g.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*j4UgSts_BKlk-prXhkVwXg.jpeg)

Due to the rain, the outdoor seating was closed, and the indoor seating was packed, so I didn't buy a coffee to sit and enjoy the view; I just took a few photos and then started to explore Takashimaya Department Store. There was a Harbs downstairs, but it required a queue.

Across the street, there was a [Sky Promenade](https://journey.tw/sky-promenade/){:target="_blank"} which is a new observation deck in Nagoya, but I decided not to go because I was tired, would have to buy a ticket, and the weather was bad; I checked the time and there were no other interesting spots left to visit; in the end, I just strolled down to the underground shopping area and bought some souvenirs (from Kero Honke); I bought a one-way ticket from Nagoya Railway to Chubu Centrair International Airport + uSky train ($271) back to the airport.

It was still not even PM 5:00, which was a bit of a pity... but going to other attractions would be too far... and I wanted to avoid the rush hour crowd.
#### 9th Destination: Strolling around Chubu Centrair International Airport

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*x3BFbEYi64LsDqs8f3G7Jw.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*m_NhGgVYi2nlI27VbeHHug.jpeg)

I took a picture of the uSky train.
#### 9/11 PM 16:44 — Arrived at Terminal 1 of Chubu Centrair International Airport

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*3BROtCPC5xEFs-s2HEwpPQ.png)

The flight is at 23:15, so there is still a long time to wait.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*-kJWx09_h9L_VYTgiNaVKw.jpeg)

First, I tried the famous Nagoya tebasaki (chicken wings).

NGO Airport has a lot to explore, besides the food and souvenirs inside, there is also a large observation deck where you can see the planes take off and land up close! (Terminal 1)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*567y9tbb7H1mGf6qeMyAlA.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*5jcf5tUyKWGEicHYE-fROg.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*IUpd954AOvd9TqJAIckFng.jpeg)

Or I could go to Terminal 2 to see the free airplane museum (but it was already closed when I went).

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*OBOPATQIn9zZWxikMYTzPg.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*Y7_RLuAEPZMDzYFlLs8rJg.jpeg)

There is also a Lawson and a capsule toy shop here (but they also have operating hours).
#### 9/11 PM 19:30 — Dinner at Terminal 1 of Chubu Centrair International Airport

For dinner, I had [Nagoya Udon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cnZpXBh68FjYK39Y8){:target="_blank"} at the airport; Nagoya's specialty noodles are flat.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*KP1z3qVdeNZAKZy_lb05Xg.jpeg)

The taste was good, but I accidentally ordered a double main dish... the pork cutlet was served with rice XD.

After eating, I continued to wait for my flight... waiting for the check-in counter to open (it opens at 20:45).
#### 9/11 PM 20:45 — Check-in at Terminal 1 of Chubu Centrair International Airport

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*sSHi3yR-JN2qt4TUsZk-lw.png)



I arrived at the corner and waited in line to prepare for departure around 20:00. United Airlines is quite strict with carry-on luggage; the rule is two pieces under 7 kilograms each, and they won't turn a blind eye. I saw someone who simply went to buy a PS5, which seems like a good one-day flash target as well.
#### 9/11 PM 21:45 — Chubu Centrair International Airport Terminal 1 Shopping at Duty-Free, Waiting for Flight


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*6Euv3ovejIlqA56pGJ8GRQ.jpeg)



![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*PSv4SLCQ4Gt1Qn-ln6ISGQ.jpeg)



![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*jspf8NsSrS2Bmuimpxl0Og.jpeg)


I only had one bag, so I could carry another one. I conveniently bought a bottle of Dassai Junmai Daiginjo 750 ml to take back to Taiwan. (5,700 yen, 100 yen more expensive than in Tokyo)

Draft cola is delicious; if you see it in supermarkets or vending machines, you should try it. It was launched by Suntory and Pepsi together, and it's not available in Taiwan. It's made using the method for draft beer, giving it a strong carbonation without the syrupy sweetness. I usually end up throwing away regular cola because it's too sweet, but I could finish the draft cola!


> Back to the strict carry-on luggage checks at United Airlines, they will check again before boarding to ensure you only have two pieces. If not, they will ask you to reduce it to two pieces on the spot or pay extra. 




#### 9/12 AM 00:09 — Chubu Centrair International Airport Terminal 1 Takeoff

Due to flight delays, the originally scheduled time of 23:15 was pushed to 23:50; we finally took off around 00:15.


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*gg0_UEjJngc-V1rOzN-Ieg.jpeg)


But I was lucky to be assigned a window seat, so I could get a good sleep.


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*CSEovXozZ5CVo6MDxYjdVQ.jpeg)



![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*SuCMeXxmdbqmzImVG08f9w.jpeg)



![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*SKnGc9Ee5aX_ifeoT-DOrg.jpeg)


After waking up, I explored the in-flight facilities and discovered that flight information and entertainment videos could be accessed by connecting to the in-flight WiFi, and you could also order food directly from your phone.

Someone ordered something like pork rib chicken noodles, and the whole cabin was filled with the aroma, which was quite tempting.
#### 9/12 AM 02:25 — Arrived at Taoyuan International Airport


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*NiUt9le-3zu4zo-0iVtZ6w.jpeg)


Fortunately, since I was by the window, I managed to catch up on some sleep during the flight; I felt relatively okay.
#### 9/12 AM 03:30 Arrived at the warm residence in Taipei

I must say that transportation in Taiwan is quite inconvenient, especially with a red-eye flight arriving at Taoyuan Airport; I could only take a terrifying flat-rate taxi or an expensive Uber back to Taipei. If I wanted to use public transport, I would have to wait for the buses that start running around 4–5 AM.
### Purpose of this trip: To visit one of the three major cities, Nagoya Castle:

Later, I found out that Nagoya also has [Inuyama Castle](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/177762?cid=19365&ud1=9da2c51fa4f2){:target="_blank"} to visit. If I were to rearrange my plans, I would probably go to Inuyama Castle first, and I still haven't had the chance to try eel rice!
