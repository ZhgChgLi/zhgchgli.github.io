### Travel Diary: One-Day Flash Trip to Nagoya on 9/11

Experience with Peach Aviation's one-day flash trip ticket to Nagoya

### Background

The one-day round-trip ticket to Nagoya was a promotion by Peach Aviation:

[![](https://www.flypeach.com/application/files/7117/4003/9350/tbssp_ogp_dangan_tw.jpg)](https://www.flypeach.com/tw/um/specials/int_shorttrip){:target="_blank"}

At that time, I purchased a round-trip ticket to Nagoya, including airport service fees, for `$5,600`. **No checked baggage, no meals, no seat selection**; both flights were red-eye flights:
- Outbound: TPE 02:25 -> NGO 06:30
- Return: NGO 23:15 -> TPE 01:25

According to the official promotional material, **the maximum stay time is 16 hours and 45 minutes**!

Carry-on baggage regulations: **Two pieces per person with a total weight of less than 7 kg**.

Date: **2023/09/11, solo trip**
#### Visit Japan

To expedite the immigration process, I filled out the entry information in advance, allowing me to complete the immigration procedures using a QR code:

- Here, I filled in the stay duration as 1 day and provided the contact information for Chubu Centrair International Airport in Japan. I wasn't questioned and passed through safely!

### Summary (Written in Advance)

The one-day flash trip is a test of both physical and mental endurance. I originally planned to sleep at the airport or on the plane, but since I arrived too early, I couldn't sleep. Once on the plane, the seats were too small, I didn't get a window seat, and the engine noise was loud, so I didn't really sleep at all. I ended up being awake the entire night. After landing at 6:00 AM, I immediately started my itinerary in Nagoya. I was so tired that I ended up taking a half-hour nap at a café in Nagoya Tower (quiet and not crowded).

With limited time and attractions, I couldn't venture too far.

In addition to my own energy levels, my phone's battery was also a significant challenge. I brought a 20,000 mAh Xiaomi power bank to complete the entire itinerary (which charged my iPhone 13 about 4-5 times).

I returned to Taiwan around 2-3 AM, and since there was no public transportation, I had to take a taxi back to Taipei.

It would be better to pay a few hundred extra for a window seat, and to prepare a neck pillow and earplugs for better sleep.
### Departure
#### 9/10 PM 22:03 — Arrived at Taoyuan Airport MRT A1 Taipei Station, took the 22:15 direct train to Terminal 1

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*dnSVLmlJGYdrhTGIIszerQ.png)

#### 9/10 PM 10:55 — Arrived at Terminal 1 Departure Hall

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*hqBq_mPwADgJVgiyTySVJA.png)

I arrived too early; the check-in counter opened at 23:55 (even though I had no checked baggage, I couldn't check in online for some reason, so I had to wait for the counter to open).

With an hour to go before check-in opened, I decided to head back to the B1 food court to find a place to rest; however, all the shops in the food court were closed at 11 PM (including convenience stores), so I couldn't buy anything to eat.
#### 9/11 AM 00:09 — Completed Departure

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*hgsHsAqRPmS42NW3Lvt0_Q.png)

The check-in counter opened early, and by 11:40, I was back in the departure hall to see that check-in had started; with no checked baggage and just a backpack, I quickly completed the check-in, security check, and departure.

On 9/11, the official countdown to 24 hours began!
#### 9/11 AM 00:12 — Wandering around Terminal 1

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*tT0HjtgmHi38ys5yK6j3TQ.jpeg)

It's worth mentioning that Terminal 1 has a free lounge area; just follow the signs to the lounge. The environment and seating are similar to a café, and there are shower facilities (open from AM 6 to PM 10). For more details, you can refer to [this article](https://stancy.tw/airport-lounge/){:target="_blank"}.

The lounge area is actually better for sleeping because you can lie down... but I only passed by and took a quick look before starting to search for food options in the airport (since there were no in-flight meals). However, it was too late, and everything was closed. I finally found a vending machine that sold snacks, so I bought a pack of I-Mei cream puffs and a can of tea to take with me.
#### 9/11 AM 00:45 — Waiting at the Boarding Gate

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*bUf08uTaKk9ecZZShKP1fA.png)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*LAFV5rJcrW9aq2HcOL7xcw.png)

I really arrived too early; there weren't many people in the waiting area. The seats were arranged in pairs, making it difficult to lie down comfortably (it looked awkward, and I got up after taking a photo). Sleeping upright was also uncomfortable, and the air conditioning in the waiting area was quite cold. However, I was still feeling relatively alert and not too sleepy. As time went on, more people arrived, and the noise level increased, making it even harder to sleep. So, I just closed my eyes to rest and conserve energy, flipping through some basic Japanese (the hiragana chart), thinking I would catch some sleep on the plane.
#### 9/11 AM 02:14 — Completed Boarding

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*urxHjZKt6pP7cZlJSYE7fw.png)

There was a slight delay in boarding; it was originally scheduled for 01:55 but was delayed by 10 minutes. I finally completed boarding at 02:15.
#### 9/11 AM 02:26 — Takeoff

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*utaf6ccP3yAzTMWB0YbN_A.jpeg)

The seats were very small, with no headrest on the aisle side. Thankfully, I brought a neck pillow for some support, but the constant roar of the engine and the strain on my neck meant I hardly slept at all. It was a bumpy ride all the way to Nagoya, and there were no screens on the plane to show the flight distance, making the time feel very long.

> If I had to choose again, I would pay a few hundred extra for a window seat; it would provide a place to rest my head and I could see the sunrise from the window when we arrived in Japan in the morning!

#### 9/11 AM 06:20 — Arrived at Chubu Centrair International Airport

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*prYbU60HuhHIVpPm0kvszw.png)

#### 9/11 AM 06:35 — Completed Immigration

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*BqtD5pBEWJrLAM5JaD4lDg.jpeg)

Perhaps because it was early in the morning and I didn't need to collect any luggage, it took less than 15 minutes from landing to immigration. However, the weather was not cooperating, as it was pouring rain in Nagoya.
#### 9/11 AM 7:03 — Waiting for Transport to Nagoya City

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*J85ZhklkjVsbi8NVG6Y8uA.jpeg)

![One ticket is for seat information, and the other is for entry (to be inserted into the machine)](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*3mfOkpdDFjb7BziVaaezRg.jpeg)

One ticket is for seat information, and the other is for entry (to be inserted into the machine).

> [_KKday Chubu Centrair International Airport NGO ⇆ Nagoya Station | Meitetsu Airport Express Train E-Ticket_](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20418-chubu-centrair-international-airport-express-train-transfer-to-nagoya?cid=19365&ud1=9da2c51fa4f2){:target="_blank"}

I first bought a one-way ticket from Chubu Centrair International Airport to Nagoya via the internet, along with a uSky train ticket ($271), thinking I might as well try the newest and best train while I'm here. It was a reserved seat, very stable and comfortable, and it was an express train.

However, if you're looking to save money and want convenience, you can actually buy a ticket for the semi-express or just hop on a regular train at the station. Here’s the train schedule and stops, or you can check directly on the [Meitetsu website](https://trainbus.meitetsu.co.jp/meitetsu-transfer-zh-tw/pc/map/Top){:target="_blank"}:

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*9UM0s_DJ8p9S4Rijxcno_w.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*Yu_6S8qQnLUfOlmByzWb_w.jpeg)

#### First Destination: [Konparu Osu コンパル 大須本店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZuXeeyb527htfdc17){:target="_blank"} for Shrimp Toast

I needed to get off at Kanayama (NH34) and transfer to the `Meijo Line` to go to Kamimaezu Station.
#### 9/11 AM 8:00 Arrived at [Konparu Osu コンパル 大須本店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZuXeeyb527htfdc17){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*BEhfcQEMNhmKAEICAAl-oQ.jpeg)

They open at 8 AM, and there was absolutely no one there that early in the morning; the nearby Osu shopping street was also closed.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*fvZ_c7ZSFzEq_5weXS3S-A.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*_bj9uvgvGuOyquI7sBCToQ.jpeg)

Coffee was a must since I hadn't slept all night; the shrimp toast was made with whole shrimp that were cut up, and you could really taste the springiness of the shrimp.
#### Second Destination: [Nagoya Castle](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UrJUoP5CSaXT9PBPA){:target="_blank"}

Nagoya Castle opens at 9:00 AM, and other attractions don't open that early. Since it was close and on the way from Kamimaezu Station, I decided to go to Nagoya Castle first.
#### 9/11 AM 9:02 Arrived at [Nagoya Castle](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UrJUoP5CSaXT9PBPA){:target="_blank"}

After finishing my meal, I set off and arrived at Nagoya Castle Station around 9:02.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*ARhQGgrg3FGmc9H78qhnZA.jpeg)

Upon exiting the station, I discovered it was pouring rain outside. I hadn't anticipated rain in Japan and didn't bring an umbrella. There weren't any convenience stores nearby, so I finally found a FamilyMart in the underground shopping area of Nagoya Castle Station, where I bought an umbrella and continued on to Nagoya Castle!

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*p8s-2KUc357TIu83Q8DzHw.jpeg)

As I entered Nagoya Castle, the rain had eased a bit, but the main keep was under renovation and closed to visitors. I could only visit the adjacent Honmaru Goten, which is beautifully adorned.

![Honmaru Goten](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*s6ReFycKcyd06J9DqWOL6Q.jpeg)

Honmaru Goten

To enter Honmaru Goten, you need to take off your shoes and store your bag (free, but you need a 100 yen coin).
#### Third Destination: [Chubu Electric Power MIRAI TOWER (formerly Nagoya TV Tower)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8eHMMb6MJ4fxZY3u9){:target="_blank"}

It's located just below Nagoya Castle, about two stops away; I took a bus to get there after leaving Nagoya Castle.
#### 9/11 AM 10:08 — Arrived at [Chubu Electric Power MIRAI TOWER (formerly Nagoya TV Tower)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8eHMMb6MJ4fxZY3u9){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*jBdGgsT8a4JR3gxGP0VVDA.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*QLSn1QzIhtBhm10LyjQNbA.jpeg)

The weather was fluctuating between cloudy and sunny; it cleared up when I arrived and turned cloudy again when I left.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*Zbvx-RhT1QcaOYsgkrROFg.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*j_Ovwa7Q9xob5m-Vo1Zt7A.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*siU1IitFVrI6Dsyp1dZhNw.jpeg)

After buying a ticket, you can go up to the observation deck to overlook Nagoya City (if you just want to go to the café on the middle level, you don't need to buy a ticket; you can still see some views from the café).

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*WK28lGWl7B0HzdDbfk92cw.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*_QCwAszlLTUNygpELmlBLA.jpeg)

The café had a great view, and as it approached 10:30, I started to feel sleepy. I ended up lying down and napping there until after 11 AM; the place had plenty of seating, was quiet, and was perfect for catching up on sleep.
#### Fourth Destination: [Oasis 21](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6TM1nshDh3kupwRa6){:target="_blank"}

Oasis 21 is right outside Nagoya Tower, but due to the rain, being a weekday, and it being early in the morning, there wasn't much to explore, so I just took a quick look around and left.
#### Fifth Destination: [Yabaton Yabacho Main Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/91JsWCJPoW2YtjVE8){:target="_blank"}

As it approached noon, I thought I would try the famous Nagoya miso pork cutlet. The main store is about one or two stops away from Nagoya Tower, so I decided to walk there.
#### Sixth Destination: [Osu Shopping District](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ErxDxS57PC1g6qyH9){:target="_blank"}

When I arrived, I found a long line and had to wait... Time was precious, and since I was close to the Osu shopping district, I decided to continue walking there to find something to eat.
#### 9/11 PM 12:09 — Arrived at [Osu Shopping District](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ErxDxS57PC1g6qyH9){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*KYRHaxHf_k_hZ22FV6TGeQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*BJVGUsAga5PLkcz6tc6iVQ.jpeg)

I walked towards Osu Kannon, and just before reaching it, I found another branch of [Shiba's restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HaHhChfzKLmvZaoBA){:target="_blank"} and went in to dine.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*c91mg_omphyNGDB6etwAHA.jpeg)

I mindlessly ordered a set meal and realized I made the wrong choice. I mainly wanted to have the miso pork cutlet in the top left corner. The set included miso pork cutlet + fried shishamo + tsukudani + side dishes + soup + rice. The miso pork cutlet was delicious, but there wasn't enough of it!

#### 6th Destination: [Osu Kannon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XepPPJRip3Tjk2ah6){:target="_blank"}

As soon as I left the restaurant, I was right at Osu Kannon.

#### 9/11 PM 13:05 — Arrived at [Osu Kannon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XepPPJRip3Tjk2ah6){:target="_blank"}

The main hall was under renovation, so I just strolled around outside before leaving.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*nhLITNzWqv3fc7FtFED3vQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*xgwH7Q8SKUNrxPyAD8m6Hw.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*gDPttxHlcEqdCTjojsaFPw.jpeg)

If you're afraid of birds, you might want to skip this place; there are a lot of pigeons outside, and you can buy feed to give them.

#### 7th Destination: [Atsuta Shrine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VhuvdRMq2R59sted7){:target="_blank"}

I walked through the Osu shopping district again and headed back to Meijo Line to go to Atsuta Shrine.

On the way, I bought some Benzaiten fruit daifuku to eat. The skin was thin and soft, and the fruit was fresh and juicy. I ended up buying two! (I think they taste better than those from Mizuan XD)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*DN_R7bcD9_PzMpBmYkK8GQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*dKEMtwKNcdw-oGVBG-c3qw.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*z2b7AWIcBsuTSj7D5m43lQ.jpeg)

I also made a quick stop at a drugstore in the shopping district to pick up some medications I could take back to Taiwan.

#### 9/11 PM 13:35 — Arrived at [Atsuta Shrine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VhuvdRMq2R59sted7){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*LO20Srhkqp684_gIe34Akw.jpeg)

After exiting Atsuta Shrine Station on the Meijo Line, I had to walk a bit further to reach the main entrance of the shrine.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*WZ0mt0OMp1dvdOX9rkFKTA.jpeg)

After a brief visit, I bought some omamori (amulets) and then left.

#### 8th Destination: [Meitetsu Nagoya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rZZB2UMYgoLPqEeC8){:target="_blank"} for Shopping

The last stop was to check out Meitetsu (though by this point, I was already quite tired).

#### 9/11 PM 14:40 — Arrived at [Meitetsu Nagoya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rZZB2UMYgoLPqEeC8){:target="_blank"}

After browsing the underground shopping area, I headed towards the JR GATE TOWER. I went up to [Starbucks on the 15th floor](https://www.bigfang.tw/blog/post/jrgatetower-starbucks-nagoya){:target="_blank"} for some free views.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*BUk_IIz5Ug7QkVBihLnL0g.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*j4UgSts_BKlk-prXhkVwXg.jpeg)

Due to the rain, the outdoor seating was closed, and the indoor seating was packed, so I didn’t buy a coffee to sit and enjoy the view; I just took a few photos before heading down to Takashimaya department store. There was a Harbs downstairs, but it required a queue.

Across the way was the [Sky Promenade](https://journey.tw/sky-promenade/){:target="_blank"}, a new observation deck in Nagoya, but I skipped it because I was tired, didn’t want to buy another ticket, and the weather was bad. I checked the time and realized there weren’t any other interesting spots I could visit, so I just wandered down to the underground shopping area to buy some souvenirs (from Kaeru Honke); I also bought a one-way ticket from Nagoya Railway to Chubu Centrair International Airport + uSky train ($271) to head back to the airport.

It was still before 5 PM, which was a bit disappointing... but going to other attractions would have been too far... and I wanted to avoid the rush hour crowd.

#### 9th Destination: Back to Chubu Centrair International Airport

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*x3BFbEYi64LsDqs8f3G7Jw.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*m_NhGgVYi2nlI27VbeHHug.jpeg)

I snapped a photo of the uSky train.

#### 9/11 PM 16:44 — Arrived at Terminal 1 of Chubu Centrair International Airport

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*3BROtCPC5xEFs-s2HEwpPQ.png)

My flight was at 23:15, so I still had a long wait ahead.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*-kJWx09_h9L_VYTgiNaVKw.jpeg)

I decided to try Nagoya's famous tebasaki (chicken wings).

NGO Airport has plenty to explore, from food and souvenirs to a large observation deck where you can watch planes take off and land up close! (Terminal 1)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*567y9tbb7H1mGf6qeMyAlA.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*5jcf5tUyKWGEicHYE-fROg.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*IUpd954AOvd9TqJAIckFng.jpeg)

You could also head to Terminal 2 to check out the free airplane museum (but it was already closed when I got there).

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*OBOPATQIn9zZWxikMYTzPg.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*Y7_RLuAEPZMDzYFlLs8rJg.jpeg)

There’s also a Lawson and a gacha store here (but they also have operating hours).

#### 9/11 PM 19:30 — Dinner at Terminal 1 of Chubu Centrair International Airport

For dinner, I had [Nagoya udon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cnZpXBh68FjYK39Y8){:target="_blank"} at the airport. The specialty noodles from Nagoya are flat.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*KP1z3qVdeNZAKZy_lb05Xg.jpeg)

It tasted good, but I accidentally ordered a double main dish... the pork cutlet came with rice XD.

After eating, I continued to wait for my flight... waiting for the check-in counter to open (which was at 20:45).

#### 9/11 PM 20:45 — Check-in at Terminal 1 of Chubu Centrair International Airport

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*sSHi3yR-JN2qt4TUsZk-lw.png)

I took a quick break in the corner until around 20:00, then lined up to prepare for departure. United Airlines is quite strict about carry-on luggage; the rule is two pieces under 7 kg each, and they won’t let it slide. I saw someone who simply bought a PS5 to bring back; that seems like a good option for a quick day trip.

#### 9/11 PM 21:45 — Duty-Free Shopping and Waiting at Terminal 1 of Chubu Centrair International Airport

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*6Euv3ovejIlqA56pGJ8GRQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*PSv4SLCQ4Gt1Qn-ln6ISGQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*jspf8NsSrS2Bmuimpxl0Og.jpeg)

Since I only had one bag, I could carry another one, so I casually bought a bottle of Dassai 2-go 750 ml to take back to Taiwan. (5,700 yen, which is 100 yen more expensive than in Tokyo).

The draft cola is delicious; if you see it in supermarkets or vending machines, you should try it! It’s a collaboration between Suntory and Pepsi, and you can’t find it in Taiwan. It’s made using the method for draft beer, so it has a strong carbonation and isn’t overly sweet. I usually end up throwing away regular cola because it gets too sweet, but I could finish the draft cola!

> Back to the strict carry-on luggage check with United Airlines, they will check again before boarding to ensure you only have two pieces. If not, they will ask you to split them on the spot or pay extra.

#### 9/12 AM 00:09 — Departure from Terminal 1 of Chubu Centrair International Airport

Due to a flight delay, my originally scheduled flight at 23:15 was pushed back to 23:50; we didn’t take off until around 00:15.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*gg0_UEjJngc-V1rOzN-Ieg.jpeg)

But I was lucky to get a window seat, so I could get some good sleep.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*CSEovXozZ5CVo6MDxYjdVQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*SuCMeXxmdbqmzImVG08f9w.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*SKnGc9Ee5aX_ifeoT-DOrg.jpeg)

When I woke up, I explored the in-flight amenities and discovered the flight information and entertainment options. You can connect to the in-flight Wi-Fi to check them, and you can also order food directly from your phone.

Someone ordered something that looked like pork rib chicken noodles, and the whole cabin was filled with a delicious aroma—very tempting.

#### 9/12 AM 02:25 — Arrived at Taoyuan International Airport

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*NiUt9le-3zu4zo-0iVtZ6w.jpeg)

Fortunately, since I had a window seat, I managed to catch up on some sleep during the flight; I felt relatively okay.

#### 9/12 AM 03:30 — Arrived at my warm home in Taipei

I have to say that transportation in Taiwan is quite inconvenient. The red-eye flight arrived at Taoyuan Airport; I had to take a terrifying flat-rate taxi or an expensive Uber back to Taipei. If I wanted to use public transport, I would have to wait for the early morning buses at around 4–5 AM.

### Purpose of This Trip: To Explore Nagoya Castle, One of the Three Great Castles

I later found out that there’s also [Inuyama Castle](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/177762?cid=19365&ud1=9da2c51fa4f2){:target="_blank"} in Nagoya, which I would have liked to visit. If I could rearrange my itinerary, I would probably prioritize Inuyama Castle, and I also missed out on trying unagi rice!
