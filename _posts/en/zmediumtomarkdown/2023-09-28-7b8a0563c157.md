### [Travelogue] 9/11 One-Day Quick Trip to Nagoya

Peach Aviation Nagoya One-Day Flash Ticket Trip Experience

### Background

One-day round-trip flight tickets to Nagoya are offered in a promotion by Peach Aviation:

[![](https://www.flypeach.com/application/files/6917/4787/8050/tbssp_ogp_dangan_tw.jpg)](https://www.flypeach.com/tw/um/specials/int_shorttrip){:target="_blank"}

At that time, I bought a round-trip ticket to Nagoya for `$5,600`, including airport service fees, **no checked baggage, no meals, no seat selection**; both flights were red-eye:

- Departure: TPE 02:25 -> NGO 06:30

- Return: NGO 23:15 -> TPE 01:25

According to the official promotion, **maximum stay time is 16 hours and 45 minutes**!

Carry-on baggage rules: **Two pieces per person & total weight under 7 kg**

- The stay duration is set to 1 day. For the contact information in Japan, I directly entered the details of Nagoya Chubu Centrair International Airport. I was not asked any questions and passed security smoothly!

### Summary (Written at the Beginning)

A one-day flash trip is a test of physical and mental endurance; I originally planned to sleep while waiting for the flight or on the plane, but the waiting time was too early to feel sleepy. After boarding, the seat was too small, I didn't get a window seat, and the engine noise was loud, so I didn't really sleep, effectively staying awake all night. After landing at 6:00, I started the Nagoya itinerary; I was so tired that I ended up napping for over half an hour in a quiet, nearly empty café at Nagoya Tower around noon.

Time and attractions are limited, so traveling too far is not feasible.

Besides the body's energy, the phone's battery is also a big challenge; I only managed to complete the entire trip with a 20,000mAh Xiaomi power bank (which charged the iPhone 13 about 4–5 times round trip).

Returning to Taiwan around 2–3 AM, there is no public transportation available, so you can only take a taxi back to Taipei.

You can pay a few hundred more to choose a window seat and prepare a neck pillow and earplugs for better sleep.

### Departure

#### 9/10 PM 22:03 — Arrived at Taoyuan Airport MRT A1 Taipei Main Station, took the 22:15 express train to Terminal 1

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*dnSVLmlJGYdrhTGIIszerQ.png)

#### 9/10 PM 10:55 — Arrived at Terminal 1 Departure Hall

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*hqBq_mPwADgJVgiyTySVJA.png)

Arrived too early; the check-in counter opens at 23:55 (although no checked baggage, online check-in was unavailable for some reason, so I still had to wait for the counter to open).

There is still one hour before check-in opens, so I decided to go back to the B1 food court to find a seat and rest; at 11 PM, all food court shops are closed (including convenience stores), so you can't buy any food.

#### 9/11 AM 00:09 — Completed Departure Procedures

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*hgsHsAqRPmS42NW3Lvt0_Q.png)

The check-in counter opened early. When I returned to the departure hall at 11:40, I saw that check-in had already started. Without checked luggage and only carrying a backpack, I quickly completed check-in, security check, and departure procedures.

Starting from 9/11, the official 24-hour countdown begins!

#### 9/11 AM 00:12 — Wandering around Terminal 1

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*tT0HjtgmHi38ys5yK6j3TQ.jpeg)

It is worth mentioning that Terminal 1 has a free lounge area open to the public. Just follow the signs to the lounge; the environment and seating are similar to a café. There is also a shower room (open from 6 AM to 10 PM). For detailed information, please refer to [this article](https://stancy.tw/airport-lounge/){:target="_blank"}.

The rest area was actually better for sleeping because you could lie down... But at that time, I just passed by and took a quick look before starting to search the airport for places selling food (since there was no airplane meal). As expected, it was too late and everything was closed. In the end, I only found a vending machine selling snacks, so I bought a pack of I-Mei cream puffs and grabbed a can of tea to take with me.

#### 9/11 AM 00:45 — Waiting at the boarding gate

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*bUf08uTaKk9ecZZShKP1fA.png)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*LAFV5rJcrW9aq2HcOL7xcw.png)

Arrived way too early, so the waiting lounge was almost empty; the seats come in pairs, making it hard to lie down and sleep (they look ugly, I got up right after taking the photo). Sleeping on my back was uncomfortable, and the air conditioning in the lounge was very cold. However, I still felt quite alert and not sleepy at that time. As time passed, more people arrived, and the noise grew louder, making it even harder to sleep. So I just closed my eyes to rest and conserve energy, reviewed some basic Japanese (hiragana and katakana), planning to sleep once on the plane.

#### 9/11 AM 02:14 — Boarding completed

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*urxHjZKt6pP7cZlJSYE7fw.png)

The flight was slightly delayed. Boarding was originally scheduled to start at 01:55 but was delayed by 10 minutes; I finally completed boarding at 02:15.

#### 9/11 AM 02:26 — Plane Takeoff

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*utaf6ccP3yAzTMWB0YbN_A.jpeg)

The seat was very small, located by the aisle without a headrest for support. Luckily, I brought a neck pillow which provided some support, but the constant engine noise plus neck soreness meant I hardly slept. The bumpy ride continued all the way to Nagoya. There was no in-flight screen showing flight distance, making the time feel very long.

> If I had to choose again, I would pay a few hundred more to get a window seat; first, having a place to rest your head makes it easier to sleep, and second, you can see the sunrise from the window when arriving in Japan in the morning!

#### 9/11 AM 06:20 — Arrive at Nagoya Chubu Centrair International Airport

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*prYbU60HuhHIVpPm0kvszw.png)

#### 9/11 AM 06:35— Completed Immigration Clearance

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*BqtD5pBEWJrLAM5JaD4lDg.jpeg)

It was probably early morning and no need to pick up luggage, so it took less than 15 minutes from plane landing to immigration; however, the weather was not favorable, and it was raining heavily in Nagoya.

#### 9/11 AM 7:03 — Waiting for the train to Nagoya city center

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*J85ZhklkjVsbi8NVG6Y8uA.jpeg)

![One image shows seat information, the other is the entry ticket (for machine scanning)](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*3mfOkpdDFjb7BziVaaezRg.jpeg)

One shows seat information, and the other is the admission ticket (for machine input).

> [*KKday Japan Chubu Centrair International Airport NGO ⇆ Nagoya Station｜Meitetsu Airport Express Train E-Ticket*](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20418-chubu-centrair-international-airport-express-train-transfer-to-nagoya?cid=19365&ud1=9da2c51fa4f2){:target="_blank"}

I first bought a one-way ticket from Chubu Centrair International Airport to Meitetsu Nagoya ($271) online, thinking since I was here, I might as well try the newest and best train; it has reserved seats, is very stable and comfortable, and is a limited express train.

However, if you want to save money and be convenient, you can buy a regular express ticket on-site or just board a local train at the station; below is the train schedule and stops, or you can check directly on the [Meitetsu website](https://trainbus.meitetsu.co.jp/meitetsu-transfer-zh-tw/pc/map/Top){:target="_blank"}:

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*9UM0s_DJ8p9S4Rijxcno_w.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*Yu_6S8qQnLUfOlmByzWb_w.jpeg)

#### Destination 1: [Konparu Osu コンパル 大須本店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZuXeeyb527htfdc17){:target="_blank"} Eat fried shrimp toast

You need to get off at Jinshan (NH34) and transfer to `Meisei Prefecture` to go to Kamimaezu Station.

#### 9/11 AM 8:00 Arrive at [Konparu Osu コンパル 大須本店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZuXeeyb527htfdc17){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*BEhfcQEMNhmKAEICAAl-oQ.jpeg)

8 o'clock when the door opens, it's completely empty early in the morning, and the nearby Osu shopping street is also not open yet.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*fvZ_c7ZSFzEq_5weXS3S-A.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*_bj9uvgvGuOyquI7sBCToQ.jpeg)

Coffee is a must, especially after staying up all night; the shrimp in the fried shrimp toast is whole, then sliced, so you can taste the springy texture of the shrimp meat.

#### Destination 2: [Nagoya Castle](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UrJUoP5CSaXT9PBPA){:target="_blank"}

Nagoya Castle opens at 9:00 AM, while other attractions open later. Since it's on the way and very close from Kamimaezu Station, we visit Nagoya Castle first.

#### 9/11 AM 9:02 Arrive at [Nagoya Castle](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UrJUoP5CSaXT9PBPA){:target="_blank"}

After eating, we set off and arrived at Nagoya Castle Station around 9:02.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*ARhQGgrg3FGmc9H78qhnZA.jpeg)

After leaving the station, I found it was raining heavily. I didn’t expect rain in Japan and didn’t bring an umbrella. The area nearby was very open with no convenience stores in sight. Finally, I found a FamilyMart on B1 of the underground street at Nagoya Castle Station, across from Nagoya City Hall. I bought an umbrella and continued to Nagoya Castle!

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*p8s-2KUc357TIu83Q8DzHw.jpeg)

Entering Nagoya Castle, the rain eased slightly, but the main keep was still under renovation and closed. Visitors could only tour the nearby lavish Honmaru Palace.

![Honmaru Palace](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*s6ReFycKcyd06J9DqWOL6Q.jpeg)

Honmaru Palace

Entering the Honmaru Palace requires removing shoes and storing bags (free, but a 100 yen coin is needed).

#### Destination 2: [Chubu Electric Power MIRAI TOWER (formerly Nagoya TV Tower)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8eHMMb6MJ4fxZY3u9){:target="_blank"}

Just at the lower right corner of Nagoya Castle, about 2 stops away; I took a bus after leaving Nagoya Castle.

#### 9/11 AM 10:08 — Arrived at [Chubu Electric Power MIRAI TOWER (formerly Nagoya TV Tower)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8eHMMb6MJ4fxZY3u9){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*jBdGgsT8a4JR3gxGP0VVDA.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*QLSn1QzIhtBhm10LyjQNbA.jpeg)

The weather was partly cloudy and partly sunny, clearing up when we arrived and becoming cloudy again when we left.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*Zbvx-RhT1QcaOYsgkrROFg.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*j_Ovwa7Q9xob5m-Vo1Zt7A.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*siU1IitFVrI6Dsyp1dZhNw.jpeg)

After purchasing a ticket, you can go up to the observation deck to overlook Nagoya city (if you only want to visit the café on the middle level, no ticket is needed; the café also offers some views).

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*WK28lGWl7B0HzdDbfk92cw.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*_QCwAszlLTUNygpELmlBLA.jpeg)

Cafe view, around 10:30, drowsiness started to hit; I napped here until after 11 before leaving. There are many seats, few people, and it's quiet... perfect for a nap.

#### Destination 3: [Oasis 21](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6TM1nshDh3kupwRa6){:target="_blank"}

Oasis 21 is right outside Nagoya Tower, but due to rain, a weekday, and morning hours, there wasn’t much to explore. We just walked around briefly and then left.

#### Destination 4: [Yabaton Yabacho Main Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/91JsWCJPoW2YtjVE8){:target="_blank"}

It was almost noon, so I decided to try Nagoya's famous miso pork cutlet. The main store is about one or two stops away from Nagoya Tower, so I chose to walk.

#### Destination 5: [Osu Shopping Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ErxDxS57PC1g6qyH9){:target="_blank"}

When I arrived, I found a long queue… Time was precious, and since it was close to Osu Shopping Street, I decided to keep walking there to find food.

#### 9/11 PM 12:09 — Arrived at [Osu Shopping Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ErxDxS57PC1g6qyH9){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*KYRHaxHf_k_hZ22FV6TGeQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*BJVGUsAga5PLkcz6tc6iVQ.jpeg)

Walk towards Osu Kannon, and just before reaching Osu Kannon, there is another branch of [Shichang](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HaHhChfzKLmvZaoBA){:target="_blank"}. Enter and dine inside.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*c91mg_omphyNGDB6etwAHA.jpeg)

Mindlessly ordered the set meal, but realized I made a mistake. The main goal was to eat the miso pork cutlet in the top left corner. The set includes miso pork cutlet + fried willow leaf fish + simmered dish + side dish + soup + rice. The miso pork cutlet is delicious but too little, not enough to satisfy!

#### Destination 6: [Osu Kannon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XepPPJRip3Tjk2ah6){:target="_blank"}

This store is right next to Osu Kannon.

#### 9/11 PM 13:05— Arrived at [Osu Kannon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XepPPJRip3Tjk2ah6){:target="_blank"}

The main hall is under maintenance, so we just walked around outside and left.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*nhLITNzWqv3fc7FtFED3vQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*xgwH7Q8SKUNrxPyAD8m6Hw.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*gDPttxHlcEqdCTjojsaFPw.jpeg)

If you are afraid of birds, don't come. There are many pigeons outside, and you can buy feed to feed them.

#### Destination 7: [Atsuta Shrine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VhuvdRMq2R59sted7){:target="_blank"}

Stroll through Osu Shopping Street once more, then head back to the Meijo Line to go to Atsuta Shrine.

Bought Benten Fruit Daifuku on the street. The skin is thin and tender, the fruit is fresh and juicy. I ate two at once! (I think it tastes better than Rushuian XD)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*DN_R7bcD9_PzMpBmYkK8GQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*dKEMtwKNcdw-oGVBG-c3qw.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*z2b7AWIcBsuTSj7D5m43lQ.jpeg)

Then I went to the shopping street’s drugstore to quickly buy some medicines that can be taken on the plane back to Taiwan.

#### 9/11 PM 13:35 — Arrived at [Atsuta Shrine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VhuvdRMq2R59sted7){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*LO20Srhkqp684_gIe34Akw.jpeg)

After exiting Meijo Line Atsuta Jingu Station, you still need to walk a bit to reach the main entrance of Atsuta Shrine.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*WZ0mt0OMp1dvdOX9rkFKTA.jpeg)

After a simple visit, I bought some omamori and left.

#### Destination 8: [Meitetsu Nagoya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rZZB2UMYgoLPqEeC8){:target="_blank"} Shopping

The last point is to visit Meitetsu (actually, by the time you get here, you’re already quite tired).

#### 9/11 PM 14:40 — Arrived at [Meitetsu Nagoya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rZZB2UMYgoLPqEeC8){:target="_blank"}

After walking around the underground shopping street, head to JR GATE TOWER and go up to the [Starbucks on the 15th floor](https://www.bigfang.tw/blog/post/jrgatetower-starbucks-nagoya){:target="_blank"}, where you can enjoy free views.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*BUk_IIz5Ug7QkVBihLnL0g.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*j4UgSts_BKlk-prXhkVwXg.jpeg)

Because it was raining, the outdoor seats were closed, and the indoor seats were full, so I didn't buy a coffee to sit and enjoy the view; after taking a few photos, I started walking down to Takashimaya Department Store. There is a Harbs on the lower floor, but it requires waiting in line.

There is a [Sky Promenade](https://journey.tw/sky-promenade/){:target="_blank"} across the street, a new observation deck in Nagoya, but we didn’t go because we were tired, had to buy another ticket, and the weather was bad. There were no other attractions of interest open within the time we had left. In the end, we just walked down to the underground shopping street and bought some souvenirs (Kaeru Honke). Then we bought a one-way ticket from Nagoya Railroad to Chubu Centrair International Airport plus the uSky train ($271) back to the airport.

It's not yet 5:00 PM, which is a bit of a pity... but going to other attractions is too far... I also want to avoid the rush hour crowd.

#### Destination 9: Wandering Around Nagoya Chubu Centrair International Airport

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*x3BFbEYi64LsDqs8f3G7Jw.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*m_NhGgVYi2nlI27VbeHHug.jpeg)

Took a quick shot of the real uSky.

#### 9/11 PM 16:44 — Arrived at Central Japan International Airport Terminal 1

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*3BROtCPC5xEFs-s2HEwpPQ.png)

23:15 The plane just took off, and there is still a long, long time ahead.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*-kJWx09_h9L_VYTgiNaVKw.jpeg)

First, buy Nagoya's famous tebasaki to try.

NGO Airport has many things to explore. Besides food, drinks, and souvenirs, there is a large observation deck where you can watch planes take off and land up close! (Terminal 1)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*567y9tbb7H1mGf6qeMyAlA.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*5jcf5tUyKWGEicHYE-fROg.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*IUpd954AOvd9TqJAIckFng.jpeg)

Or first go to Terminal 2 to see the free airplane museum (it was already closed when I visited).

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*OBOPATQIn9zZWxikMYTzPg.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*Y7_RLuAEPZMDzYFlLs8rJg.jpeg)

There is also a Lawson and a capsule toy store here (but they also have business hours).

#### 9/11 PM 19:30 — Chubu Centrair International Airport Terminal 1 Dinner

For dinner, I had [Nagoya Udon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cnZpXBh68FjYK39Y8){:target="_blank"} at the airport. Nagoya's specialty noodles are flat.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*KP1z3qVdeNZAKZy_lb05Xg.jpeg)

The taste is good, but I accidentally ordered two main dishes... His pork cutlet is served as a pork cutlet rice XD

After eating, continue waiting at the gate… waiting for the check-in counter to open (opens at 20:45).

#### 9/11 PM 20:45 — Central Japan International Airport Terminal 1 Departure Procedures

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*sSHi3yR-JN2qt4TUsZk-lw.png)

Napped in the corner for a bit, then went to line up for departure around 8 PM; United Airlines is quite strict with carry-on luggage checks, enforcing the rule of two items under 7 kg each without exceptions. I also saw someone who was just there to buy a PS5 and bring it back—seems like a good choice for a one-day quick trip.

#### 9/11 PM 21:45 — Central Japan International Airport Terminal 1 Shopping Duty-Free Stores, Waiting for Flight

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*6Euv3ovejIlqA56pGJ8GRQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*PSv4SLCQ4Gt1Qn-ln6ISGQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*jspf8NsSrS2Bmuimpxl0Og.jpeg)

I only have one bag, so I can carry one more by hand. I conveniently bought a bottle of Dassai 23 750 ml before returning to Taiwan. (5,700 yen, 100 yen more expensive than in Tokyo)

Draft Coke tastes good. You can buy it at supermarkets or vending machines to try. It is launched by Suntory and Pepsi together and is not available in Taiwan. It uses the brewing method of draft beer to make cola, giving it a strong carbonation and less syrupy sweetness. I usually pour out regular cola because it gets too sweet toward the end, but I can finish draft Coke!

> Back to the strict carry-on luggage check at United Airlines, they will recheck before boarding to ensure you only have two items. If not, you will have to reduce to two items on the spot or pay an extra fee.

#### 9/12 AM 00:09 — Depart from Central Japan International Airport Terminal 1

Due to a flight delay, the original departure time of 23:15 was postponed to 23:50; the flight took off around 00:15.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*gg0_UEjJngc-V1rOzN-Ieg.jpeg)

But luckily, I got a window seat, so I can get some good sleep.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*CSEovXozZ5CVo6MDxYjdVQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*SuCMeXxmdbqmzImVG08f9w.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*SKnGc9Ee5aX_ifeoT-DOrg.jpeg)

After waking up and researching the onboard facilities, I found that flight information and entertainment videos can be accessed through the onboard WiFi using your phone. You can also order food directly via your phone.

Someone ordered something like pork rib chicken noodles, and the whole cabin was filled with the aroma. It was quite tempting.

#### 9/12 AM 02:25 — Arrive at Taoyuan International Airport

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*NiUt9le-3zu4zo-0iVtZ6w.jpeg)

Luckily, I was seated by the window and managed to catch some sleep on the plane; my energy is still okay.

#### 9/12 AM 03:30 Arrive at the warm Taipei accommodation

I have to say, transportation in Taiwan is very inconvenient. With red-eye flights arriving at Taoyuan Airport, you can only take the dreaded flat-rate taxi or an expensive Uber back to Taipei. If you want to use public transport, you have to wait for the bus at 4–5 AM.

### Purpose of this line: To collect Nagoya Castle, one of the three famous castles:

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*82_Qk5PUJiXzaKxKVb-1fw.jpeg)

Later, I found out that Nagoya also has [Inuyama Castle](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/177762?cid=19365&ud1=9da2c51fa4f2){:target="_blank"} worth visiting. If I were to plan again, I’d probably visit Inuyama Castle first. Also, I didn’t get to try the eel rice!
