### \[Travelogue\] 2023 Tokyo 5-Day Free Trip

Following last month's trip to Kansai, here is the record and information on the 5-day free trip to Tokyo in June 2023.

#### 2023/05 Kansai 8-Day Free Trip

Following the previous article "[**\[Travelogue\] 2023 Kansai & 🇯🇵 First Landing**](../76d66c2e34af/)", I quickly returned to Japan a week later.

You may wonder why I didn't stay in Japan and take the Shinkansen from Osaka to Tokyo directly? The reason is that the Tokyo trip was actually the originally planned overseas travel, while the Kansai trip was purely a bonus.

Additionally, I was too lazy to change my flight and accommodation and didn't want to have a week of Work From Japan (I believe that when traveling, it should be purely for fun), so I returned to Taiwan after the Kansai trip.

Looking back, it was a good thing I came back; because during the week I returned to Taiwan, Japan encountered a super strong typhoon, causing flooding, suspension of Shinkansen services, and overcrowded stations; if I had been in Japan that week, I probably wouldn't have had many places to go. \(Finally, I'm not the 🌧️ Rain God anymore ah ah ah\)

#### Tokyo Trip Combination — Three Single Men

Me & my current colleague (Sean) & my former colleague ([James Lin](https://medium.com/u/cbe4c8255367){:target="_blank"}); among them, Sean & James are college classmates. \(That's right, the industry is that small XD\)

> For information on Japan's entry requirements and other insights, please refer to the [**previous article**](../76d66c2e34af/) .

### Pre-Trip Preparation

Although the Tokyo trip was indeed the planned overseas arrangement, we had only been talking about it; it wasn't until I had mostly confirmed my Kansai trip that I began to plan and execute the Tokyo trip.
#### Fun

![[tripmoment](https://www.instagram.com/p/CuE3jtkvjfS/){:target="_blank"}](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*DB9YKp-hY9VAiMClqU_MpQ.png)


[tripmoment](https://www.instagram.com/p/CuE3jtkvjfS/){:target="_blank"}

For places I haven't been to, I still embody the ENFP free spirit, feeling that anywhere is fresh and new; thus, I mainly handle the big picture regarding flights, accommodations, and transportation; the attractions are decided based on where my travel companions want to go or where we feel like exploring at the moment.

Sean & James primarily handled everything, and we planned to buy tickets in advance for Disneyland (Sea) and the Gundam in Yokohama, as well as Shibuya Sky; therefore, we purchased the tickets two weeks before departure.

> If you don't buy tickets in advance, there will be no available spots when you arrive.

This time, I brought the leftover money from my last trip, totaling ¥60,000, and ended up with about ¥5,000 left.

> This was because I encountered issues with my Visa card at a drugstore in Shinjuku and had to pay cash for over ¥10,000 worth of cosmetics, plus I wanted to spend all my cash in the end.

> **Additionally, I almost couldn't return; when buying tickets to Narita Airport at Tokyo Station, I couldn't use my card and had to gather enough cash.**

#### Travel
#### 🛫

Since this trip was only for 5 days, time was limited, so I prioritized flights that left early and returned late; because the dates were close, I directly used [SkyScanner](https://www.skyscanner.com.tw/){:target="_blank"} to find suitable flights.

Taoyuan &lt;\-&gt; Narita
- 6/7 `EVA Air BR 184` 08:00 TPE \-&gt; NRT 12:25
- 6/22 `EVA Air BR 195` 20:40 NRT \-&gt; TPE 23:20

Round trip: `$17,086`

> I made a mistake here, **I shouldn't have booked three tickets under one name; everyone should buy their own, as purchasing tickets with a credit card provides travel insurance.**

> Later, I found out that flying from Songshan to Haneda wasn't much more expensive and was more convenient. Orz.

Travel insurance: Done
#### 📲

I also bought a 5-day unlimited SIM card on KKDAY for about $500. \( [**Japan eSIM Card | Daily High-Speed, Unlimited Data Plan**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137689-japan-high-speed-daily-unlimited-data-japanese-esim?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} **\)**
#### 🚈

Just like in [the previous article](../76d66c2e34af/), I used a Suica card directly with my iPhone; my friend, who has an Android, had to buy a Welcome Suica limited-time card (there was really only this option left at Narita Airport).
#### Accommodation

This time, I only went to Tokyo, so I looked for a place to stay for four days without needing to change hotels; since the dates were close, all the chain hotels in Tokyo, like Toyoko Inn or APA, were fully booked; I could only search on [Agoda](https://www.agoda.com){:target="_blank"} for hotels near the center of Tokyo with train and subway stations.

#### [Hotel Villa Fontaine Grand Tokyo\-Shiodome](https://www.hvf.jp/chi/shiodome/){:target="_blank"} — 4 nights

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*Rmn-DpTQOp_8SuZC7D6a9w.png)

Exiting the hotel leads directly to Shiodome Station, allowing easy access to Odaiba or Shinjuku.

If you want to go to other locations, you need to walk to Shinbashi Station (about 10 minutes), and it takes about another 10 minutes to get from Shinbashi to Tokyo Station (a distance of 1-2 stops).

It's quite convenient, reasonably priced, and has decent reviews; during my stay, it was clean and comfortable, and the room wasn't too small.

Since there were three of us, the layout included two beds plus a mattress on the sofa (it felt just like a bed).

`3 people total NT$23,894`
#### CHO Stay Capsule Hotel - The only airport capsule hotel in Taiwan | Taoyuan Airport Capsule Hotel | Taoyuan Airport Hotel | 桃園空港 ホテル — Day 0 Overnight

This trip was a bit special because we had an 8 AM flight, and we all departed from Taipei; we aimed to arrive at the airport by 6 AM, so we had to leave home around 4-5 AM; plus, the excitement of going out made it hard to sleep, and I barely got a few hours of rest.

Therefore, a few days before departure, we decided to stay overnight at the airport the night before; I heard from friends that Taoyuan Airport has a capsule hotel, so I decided to give it a try!

**Location: On the 5th floor, south side of Terminal 2; it's about a 5-minute walk down to Terminal 2.**

The rooms include double rooms, triple rooms, quadruple rooms, and single beds (there are about 16 beds in one room).

When we booked, only single beds were left.

`1 person NT$1,500`
### Day 0 Departure

Basically, I just unloaded the items I bought in the Kansai region, took out some clothes and supplies, and reorganized everything back into my suitcase before heading out.

Currently, the airport express check-in cannot process flights for the next day, so I had to carry my suitcase and bags to Terminal 2.

![Sean & Me & James](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*6UqQYKaXfNQdBnFp9R3xiQ.jpeg)


Sean & Me & James

After arriving at Terminal 2, go straight up to the third floor departure hall. Once you reach the departure hall, find the location for the 22–26 south side shopping mall viewing platform (walk to the end on the right side facing the hall).

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*qyq1j5yqLGVULKNLWkqZIA.jpeg)

Walk to the end and you will see the escalator going up.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*Er0-P1N757FtpcbrB_pbAw.jpeg)

As soon as you get off the escalator, you will see the entrance of a hotel with a very Taiwanese style.
#### Taoyuan Airport Capsule Hotel

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*JKa9ZqlcB4TI9ZKOlMFgRg.jpeg)

After check-in, you can go in to drop off your luggage and then go out to find something to eat.

> Eating and drinking are prohibited in the room. During our stay, each person received a tea bag that can be brewed by the front desk. You can drink it at the bar at the entrance, and filling out the membership form on-site will get you a towel.

There are earplugs available for free at the entrance.

![Corridor](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*iB33QoGum1Cw10YzBY8Dxw.jpeg)

Corridor

The bathroom facilities are very new, clean, and comfortable. There are two toilets, five shower rooms, and two hair dryers (one Dyson). Shower gel and shampoo are provided; just bring your own towels and toiletries.

![Men's Bathroom](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*pjiN4oVjzMoDvdLIhx6CxA.jpeg)

Men's Bathroom

As soon as you enter, there is a luggage room on the left side where you can store your luggage. The bed layout is as follows:

![Bunk Dormitory](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*HZ3PD1MWsTApYW6AHOUflw.jpeg)

Bunk Dormitory

Each bed has its own mirror, desk, lamp, curtains, and trash can. I slept on the upper bunk, and the mattress is thick enough that I didn't worry about disturbing the person below when moving around.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*WapoSZK_UNvxhtBxkxTg_A.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*H5DnGbCMcYR_m5dPA4Ai-A.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*V3z2fvEzX_68xJA8WNghug.jpeg)

The mattress is not only thick but also long enough; at 176 CM, I had no issues sleeping comfortably. The environment is clean, the lighting is warm, and the air conditioning is very comfortable. The only unavoidable factor is that if someone snores, it can still be heard. (That's why earplugs are provided for free at the entrance.)

However, I’m not afraid of noise; as long as it’s warm and relaxing, I can sleep well. So I slept soundly until dawn, waking up just before 6 AM to wash up and check out (I made sure to get enough sleep before heading abroad).

> Luckily, we made a reservation the night before; we saw other travelers wanting to check in on-site, but there were no available spots.

**In the morning, I leisurely enjoyed the airport view:**

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*4e9nx9AqkHAspmo-0Td0oA.jpeg)

I initially thought it would be crowded at 8 AM, but we were fortunate to find it almost empty.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*4f8UWrza1Okcvoukg3mPUg.png)

> If I had known, I would have slept until 7 AM at the capsule hotel before coming down!

#### Waiting for the Flight

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*cDAxkVfCKhU2GDdnSsXwVg.png)

This time, the boarding gate required taking a shuttle bus (which mainland Chinese netizens refer to as a ferry bus).

It was hot and crowded, but we still made it to the boarding gate:

Hey 🇯🇵
### Day 1 Shibuya, Parco, Shibuya Sky

It takes about 15 minutes to walk from the plane to the immigration hall, and by the time I picked up my luggage and cleared customs, it was already around 1 PM.

> When transferring to the Narita Express, I initially made a mistake by directly swiping my Suica card to enter the station; it turned out that the entire express train had reserved seats, so I had to go back out to buy a ticket before re-entering (later I found out that you can buy tickets directly at the machines on the platform).

Later, I took the Narita Express that departed at 2 PM towards Tokyo Station.

Enjoying the scenery along the way, I knew we were getting close when I could see the Tokyo Skytree.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*YO53PPzkd1pty4wiJG8S1Q.jpeg)

After arriving at Tokyo Station, I transferred to the subway to Shimbashi Station, then found my way and walked to Shiodome.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*BJRI1bMRAimZwZsWotRSNw.jpeg)

The hotel is hidden inside an office building, which is quite unique:

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*aeJBrZYJVnX7r34nB1xkPw.jpeg)



At first, I thought I had taken a wrong turn and ended up at an office building, but walking inside led me to the hotel.

Drop off luggage and take a break:

> \(The video was shot later, so it's a bit messy XD\) 

#### Heading to 渋谷 (Shibuya)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*obdAUlAcMo_XF7OhzwOZ9A.jpeg)

This intersection is a must-visit, reminding me of the game "Alice in Borderland."

#### 渋谷 Parco — Gokumiya

I lined up to taste the famous Gokumiya, arriving around 5:30 PM, and waited about 45 minutes for a seat.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*Hq4ZZus6otV8oujKPbMq2g.png)

I ordered the Kobe beef hamburger steak + Kobe beef steak + soup rice ice cream combo (¥3,355):

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*4PuNFhfENy4T-pFkpkw8TA.jpeg)

The staff helped set the doneness to about 1 minute; I had to pick it up and cook it on the iron plate to my preferred doneness.
[Gokumiya](https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FpM5PdAgkff0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DpM5PdAgkff0&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube){:target="_blank"}

Here, it's important to use two pairs of chopsticks; for hygiene, use the metal ones for cooking and the bamboo ones for eating, alternating between them.

> The Kobe beef steak is incredibly delicious, juicy, and tender, with no beefy smell 🤩; the hamburger steak is also good, but a bit greasy. 

#### 渋谷 Parco — White Bear Specialty Store for Self-Mockery

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*XilYbEGfUk_fumZB-13wBQ.jpeg)

I accidentally bought a few items.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*n-6j2hBn7yFv5GWdT5IXvQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*EVMK1Xs008hrMemTREy0lg.jpeg)

#### 渋谷 — Shibuya Sky

Fortunately, Sean bought tickets in advance; if we had tried to buy them on-site, we wouldn't have been able to get in.

> [_KKday SHIBUYA SKY Observation Deck E-Ticket｜Instant Use_](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/133300-shibuya-sky-observatory-e-ticket-tokyo?cid=19365&ud1=9da2c51fa4f2){:target="_blank"} 

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*Y8fe8ipVvPkmsC5tEWjydA.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*YamJAsdoJqsWXDXg7YKhew.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*QkUR4xqKdDzWuklM5PR3ig.jpeg)

It was dark and a bit windy up there, and bags were not allowed (there are lockers available).


Aside from a bar in the corner, there are no other facilities or light pollution, making it beautiful for photography and enjoying the night view.


![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*uhHCprXit7mYFyu6HCoiAg.jpeg)


Reservations are required for the bar, and its opening hours are the same as the visiting hours.
#### After returning to the hotel, it was still a set of sake instant noodles and snacks, concluding this day.


![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*TT-j2Sj1vWfmth-ZS_Z-gg.jpeg)


The tofu skin instant noodles are delicious.
### Day 2 Yokohama Gundam, Odaiba, Shinjuku

On the second day, we rushed to the 10 AM Gundam show, first taking the train to Sakuragicho Station, then transferring to the cable car and walking to the Gundam factory.
#### Yokohama Gundam

The weather is fantastic!!


![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*AnglNbNjJIs2vtb0ZRwmLg.jpeg)



![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*T2dI7E67tVo7ry_CCPstuQ.jpeg)


The Gundam show runs from 10 AM to noon, with different scenes featuring different storylines; however, since I'm not a Gundam fan, I just came along to take a look.


![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*nC1qT8je0_-BSsurwLMepg.jpeg)


But I must say it is spectacular, with intricate details, movements, and sounds.

There is also a merchandise store inside, selling Gundam models and exclusive products.


![Sean's Gundam model](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*t70FVdaQOhob57EloFJ9Xw.png)

Sean's Gundam model

Since I'm not a Gundam fan, I strolled around, watched a few shows, and then left.


![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*-og2iIKkz5menbCEJS2Dgw.jpeg)

#### Odaiba

Next, we headed to Odaiba. The train from Shiodome to Odaiba is very cool, offering views of Fuji TV and the entire Odaiba landscape along the way.

Upon arriving in Odaiba, we first went to see the Statue of Liberty.


![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*WQxqFMk-6cnnDnd95B-6DA.jpeg)


It is a 1/7 scale replica of the Statue of Liberty in New York, symbolizing the friendly relationship between Japan and France.

Walking a bit further and looking back, you can see Fuji TV, which has been destroyed many times by A-Liang in "Police Story."


![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*tDlrcGkzGBwu0kj8jYu2-A.jpeg)


Walking a bit further to the shopping mall, we had takoyaki and Taiwanese fried chicken?


![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*Gczbh-nh0QAi3N_4z2JgUA.jpeg)



![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*wcT0OfzXwGJrHahYmTLrwA.jpeg)


The takoyaki was average, too many pieces made it greasy; the fried chicken was quite special, although labeled as Taiwanese karaage, it was actually Japanese-style fried chicken (thin, boneless) prepared with Taiwanese batter, which is still different from Taiwanese fried chicken. However, I still told the staff it was delicious, and that I was Taiwanese. 🤣

I originally planned to go to the department store in Odaiba to buy some clothes and shoes, but when I noticed the subway could take me to Shinjuku, I suddenly decided to head to Shinjuku instead.
#### Shinjuku


![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*4cPMIl0DjJ7uWPDZasUHxQ.jpeg)


Started shopping and exploring


![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*vzmc5y64lF13AgrWLe12Lg.png)


Went to La Lebo to smell the Tokyo-exclusive GAIAC No. 10 scent


![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*5RR4vqns2lSpT6gkdm71ww.jpeg)


I found it very faint… woody notes… hard to detect. (But I still bought it on Day 4)

In the end, I only went to the department store to buy some clothes, pants, and cosmetics, and as the weather started to turn rainy, I headed back to the hotel.


![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*-5iWakgBSlEzUEGhJA2s-w.jpeg)



![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*d0K2ZbPy8YgCg4wMVoxGZA.jpeg)

#### Ending this day with food


![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*ZWcMaraJGg-8Zv7oUf8fRw.jpeg)



![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*As65RwlCb7XetKxKUGukVQ.jpeg)


The hot dog was delicious, and the fruit wine was tasty!
### Day 3 DisneySea

Set off early in the morning, the weather was drizzly that day.

```markdown
![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*vqUrUe5FNFzryFbvAvrcvw.png)

What we bought was the ocean, not the land; **the beautiful castle is on land; to enter the ocean, you need to take the tram inside the park.**

> After entering the park, we started drawing for performances or entry, but we didn't win anything. In the end, we purchased front-row seats for the evening fireworks event "[Believe! ~Dreams of the Sea~](https://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/tc/tds/show/detail/967/){:target="_blank"}" (you can also watch from the outside; the performance is in the harbor's public area).

The rain got heavier, so we first went to a roadside shop to buy Mickey raincoats:

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*9lsNKkavLOuvqT1yl8D1lA.jpeg)

I personally think the quality and material are quite good, and there are cute Mickey or Minnie patterns (deep red) to choose from, plus they are not expensive!!

> Fortunately, it stopped raining in the afternoon!! I'm not a rain man!!

After buying the raincoat, we headed straight to "[Toy Story Mania](https://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/tc/tds/attraction/detail/218/){:target="_blank"}":

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*2XsAMXMFVdNAokElJnOrOQ.png)

There were a lot of people, and we waited for about 100 minutes to get in:

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*oqPUcKWHu-xATVI66jwyog.png)

The game involves two people (one person plays against a machine) operating buttons to shoot and score points by hitting projected balloons. It's very fun, low on thrills, and perfect for couples or families.

Next to it, there is Mr. Potato Head's interactive theater performance and a small souvenir shop:

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*tHEJS-t9ekHKcNQAKVJWFg.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*X-RML71tyLG1Lf2YfTEiIQ.jpeg)

Such a cute Buzz Lightyear plush toy!!

Next is "[Soaring: Fantastic Flight](https://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/tc/tds/attraction/detail/219/){:target="_blank"}," which is also a popular attraction:

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*Iu-kJ4T7IFl5SGdd97j-Bw.png)

After queuing to enter, there is a scene introduction before the game starts, telling the story of explorers. The paintings on the wall are actually high-definition screens with animations and narration, and the effects are impressive!

The theater features a spherical giant screen and a 4D experience (the seats rise and move forward + air scents); the content showcases landscapes from around the world, such as the prairie, which has the scent of grass; it's stunning and suitable for everyone!

> Here, we bought a fast pass.

After enjoying these two attractions, it was close to noon, and we started looking for food. Since the restaurants were all full, we could only find snacks, so we casually ate pizza, chicken legs, etc.

After getting our food, the harbor performance event "[Colorful Celebration](https://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/tc/tds/show/detail/7600/){:target="_blank"}" started:

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*keIJd3s_CB0H6mWtIeC0tQ.png)

After eating, we began to wander around the park and browse the souvenir shops:

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*9QKg5HDPunx0PZRrZH89YQ.jpeg)

After digesting a bit, we started queuing for "[Journey to the Center of the Earth](https://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/tc/tds/attraction/detail/223/){:target="_blank"}":

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*I0LqAW-wZDyN_1K5_H43Qg.png)

It takes about 90–100 minutes, and we finished queuing just as we completely digested our food; otherwise, it would have been too thrilling XD.

The content is a recreation of the movie "Journey to the Center of the Earth," with impressive scenes and immersion; at the end, there is a speed-up and a slight drop (weightlessness), which is thrilling but not to the point of making your legs weak, suitable for those looking for a bit of excitement.

After that, we went to the nearby "[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea](https://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/tc/tds/attraction/detail/224/){:target="_blank"}" to relax a bit:

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*NJywRyGoCa9BNKaUqvlemA.png)

There weren't many people, and the content simulates the feeling of a submarine diving for exploration (but it should be a simulation), with very low thrill levels, suitable only for small children.

After the ride, we continued to stroll and eat:

The adorable yet sweet Mickey popsicle, along with Annabelle (Rena Belle).

Continuing to walk and take photos, the park is really large, and I only took some landscape shots without capturing any animated dreamlike scenes:

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*Pl_nwojSuuquv-VLQOm58g.jpeg)

At the end, I went on the "[Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Crystal Skull](https://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/tc/tds/attraction/detail/222/){:target="_blank"}":

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*ZMh0hWKGupZRxJgsNXfrfA.png)

It's not as thrilling as the Journey to the Center of the Earth (there's no weightlessness or rapid drops), but it features immersive scenes from the Indiana Jones movie, which I personally found interesting and fun.

Continuing to stroll around:

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*hCeIoKfi2veTSmRWH0CZCg.jpeg)

I also took the "[DisneySea Cruiser](https://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/tc/tds/attraction/detail/228/){:target="_blank"}" and the "[DisneySea Electric Railway](https://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/tc/tds/attraction/detail/232/){:target="_blank"}" since my feet were quite sore; it was nice to enjoy the scenery along the way. These are more like transportation facilities within the park, without any special amusement effects.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*KWbqv6CaoVVGok0hzZ0fgw.png)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*6hMLokOuPwDLurMLOtUg5A.png)

As evening approached, I started shopping and taking photos:

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*11AiTLI65mPKAttUqSO5Dg.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*5LfL8aDEYMtOY4kuE90VnQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*PD7-NdkkV6NOs33IMyiUZg.jpeg)

I must say, it's easy to go a little crazy shopping because there are many 40th-anniversary limited items; I also took a photo with the Earth.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*2MA_aEegXzJBr-Ql3je5fw.jpeg)

As the performance time approached, I started walking back to the harbor and sat on the ground to watch.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*K8r1gw1n6vYmB6vKcy6jsA.jpeg)

As mentioned earlier, we purchased general seating for the performance.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*BXMRuey4swVQU_t-RJ8_Eg.jpeg)

The entire performance was highly immersive, featuring music, projections (the volcano in the back will explode!), lasers, fireworks, and storylines involving DisneySea characters... all combined very well. It's definitely worth staying until the evening to watch the performance.

> My takeaway from the whole day at Disney is that all the attractions are very immersive; they are not just simple amusement rides, but rather hope to immerse visitors in those roles and scenes. Although the thrill factor is not as high as Universal Studios, I found it very enjoyable; the evening fireworks show is a must-see!

> There are many cute merchandise items, so I have to control my spending (watch out for impulse buying)!

> As for food, I just ate whatever; I think it would be better to bring my own food from outside.

> If time permits, it’s best to spend two days, one for land and one for sea, as the sea doesn’t have the dream castle and the parades on land QQ.

Outside JR Maihama Station, there’s one last merchandise store to shop at, and I browsed a bit more before reluctantly leaving.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*sjLZ5Z5SMhCy3aztiRlzuQ.jpeg)

After returning to the hotel, I continued my daily routine; today I had soy sauce ramen, melon fruit juice (delicious!!), Akiya's plum wine (delicious!!), and oolong shochu (tasteless, not good).

### Day 4 Tokyo Tower, Meiji Shrine, Le Labo, Kameari Kōsuke, Asakusa Kaminarimon, Skytree
```


After a good night's sleep, I started thinking about today's itinerary (crazy ENFP). The only plan with everyone is to visit the Tokyo Skytree in the evening; my friends went to Akihabara in the morning, making it a day for solo exploration in Tokyo.
#### Tokyo Tower

Looking at the map, Shinbashi is not far from Tokyo Tower; I decided to head there first.

Upon stepping outside, I found that there was a serious delay on the subway due to an incident. Checking Google Maps, it wasn't far, so I decided to walk (about 20 minutes):

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*Hu0eoVMLRTU5tfeA7HPijQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*YQb_lv1esIYorwMryCr36g.png)

Walking alone on the streets of Tokyo, the weather in June isn't too hot, and the breeze feels very pleasant.

![Encountering a vendor selling hot roasted sweet potatoes by the roadside](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*RQ0g6aiDlD0zLw5RSLWCFA.jpeg)

As I approached Tokyo Tower, I passed by a park called "Tokyo Metropolitan Shiba Park," where the view of the tower through the branches added a unique charm:

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*P-o2_bfcqUeub916tj1D7w.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*M5ZovPIjPiw5VqDGelvebg.jpeg)

Continuing along the path, I soon arrived at the base of Tokyo Tower.

> [_KKday Japan Tokyo | Tokyo Tower Main Observatory Tokyo Tower | Electronic Ticket_](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/12271-japan-tokyo-tower-observatory-e-ticket?cid=19365&ud1=9da2c51fa4f2){:target="_blank"}

Upon entering the tower, I purchased a Top Deck ticket; it allows access to the very top of the tower and includes a guided tour (with Chinese audio), along with a commemorative photo! (The experience was fantastic.)

The tour featured animated murals similar to those at Disney yesterday, where two figures were in conversation about constructing a landmark building in Japan. The same architect's other work is the Tsutenkaku in Osaka.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*-ZkaTiB6kzQkDyBazNXLkA.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*2VClezC4dtksf5PN0mEhNA.jpeg)

The morning view of Tokyo was also nice, with the third photo showing the Skytree I would visit in the evening.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*n1dDiGftpQvwKkY1LDtMIQ.jpeg)

Finally, here’s the free commemorative photo of reaching the top!
#### Meiji Shrine

After visiting Tokyo Tower, I checked the map and decided my next stop would be Meiji Shrine.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*qY6-WdQcQCIFUTbEKlYSRw.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*KbW1JRtyVexhvHssf9g_ag.jpeg)

After exiting the subway, I walked quite a distance (about 30 minutes) to reach Meiji Shrine.

A particularly special moment was witnessing a traditional Japanese wedding taking place nearby:

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*qXdrqbv0LoJR7BdqckJiDw.png)

After completing my prayers at the main hall, I left.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*xKZTG5SBp4LjtNql4Dp0bg.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*hkBoD6TOIShhgzbTKWqjqQ.jpeg)

I found Meiji Shrine to be more solemn and serious, while at Senso-ji, I felt overwhelmed by the large number of tourists.

My next stop was to see the turtle from the anime "Kameiwa," which I had watched since childhood; I wanted to see what it looked like. On the way, I first stopped by Le Labo on Omotesando to take another whiff.
#### LE LABO Aoyama Store

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*OZJFqxDC_0frM3xkudb63Q.jpeg)

Actually, I’m not very interested in Le Labo; I personally prefer Ormonde Jayne's perfumes, and Le Labo gives me a feeling of mass-market packaging.

After smelling a few scents, I bought Another 13, which has a strong fragrance; I also bought the Tokyo-exclusive Gaiac 10, both in 15ml as souvenirs.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*PBUk6IdNV2kw4ZpB7SCu3Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*KaOECmNGfhA9B5ZS_FyxsQ.jpeg)

Le Labo perfumes are packaged and labeled on-site (which takes about 15–20 minutes), and you can customize your own label; I chose "ZhgChgLi" for the one I like, and for the 10, I asked the staff which one represents Japan in broken English, and he said ♨️ 😝.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*fBbNbDepYioQ-3-0XUkF6Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*_Qc4ACWyrwRMySf1Fi1Cdg.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*FtYkdADxxMO9kM2ydLlrxQ.jpeg)

The prices for Le Labo in Japan are as above, and after tax exemption, it is $1,000 yen less for the final price.

The Tokyo-exclusive Gaiac 10 is more expensive, costing $16,800 yen after tax exemption.
#### Kameari Kōen-mae Station

After shopping, continue to Kameari (Kameari is quite far).

As soon as you exit the main station, there is a statue of the characters from "Kōsuke Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo":

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*5m5n6x_AGTcBoHdwC9fcpA.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*VNASd480pT1np0ChP8UUTQ.jpeg)

Check the map and head to Kameari Park at the back station for a stroll:

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*NYS9o14wvInusHapES6O3g.jpeg)

It's just an ordinary park QQ, with many kids playing soccer inside. There was a statue of a character sitting on a park bench, but it was covered with kids' bags, so I didn't take a photo.

Searching online, I found that the nearby Ario department store has scenes from "Kōsuke Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo" and an amusement park, so I continued walking (about 10 minutes):

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*vMYN748lhAPZMtldFg-sCQ.jpeg)

Once inside, my mood collapsed. It was almost certain that Kameari is no longer maintaining the "Kōsuke Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo" IP (young people don't watch it anymore...). Aside from the statue at the station, from the ordinary park to the so-called "Kōsuke Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo" amusement park, only the set remains; the rest has been converted into an amusement area (claw machines).

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*pziBGruIWSnwW3_N9NfLow.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*kA38dbh-d9LbLeN4Ry3n3A.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*GjJaNMHuYh1SZouqD2JD3Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*dkNLvwyq9WOA6UqTFZEZgw.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*bQLotxWMhfiN4XWkLDSf3w.png)

The worst part was the gashapon machine at the entrance; the eyes of the character statue were broken and not repaired, making it all very desolate. In the end, I got a hot pants police officer and left in disappointment.

Looking at the map, taking the bus to Asakusa is closer. Checking the route and walking to the bus stop took about 15 minutes:

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*XPbj5XfHzc3fEGrEkqexjg.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*fWkcbD3V6XuX1AkOm4jtCQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*QGoIEXwfvaXaRoNQzDeIZA.jpeg)

On the way to the bus stop, there were almost no people or tourists, and the bus stop route on Google didn't even have a translation; I really felt like I had arrived in a non-touristy area.

There was a mix-up when getting on the bus because in Kyoto, you pay after getting off, so I stood there blankly, not understanding Japanese, until a kind Japanese passenger said "pay pay," and I finally realized I needed to go to the front to swipe my card for payment.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*Y1dHfDW3NEp6o_pR37QkPQ.png)

The ride was very quiet and comfortable; Japanese drivers wait until passengers are seated and getting off before starting the bus. We swayed all the way to Senso-ji Temple.

There were really a super, super lot of tourists!! It was so crowded that I could only find angles to take photos.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*Dl0nBekoxfLB74mPcsbWQA.png)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*e8HI49pV3p1wN7KWcdKxzg.jpeg)

Continuing towards Senso-ji Temple, there were indeed too many tourists. I originally had no intention of buying anything, just walking around to take a look; along the way, I came across this bean shop, which was unexpectedly delicious, so I bought some as a souvenir.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*NBeDq3rtDDpHomg_ZusEBw.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*M8u74mlQMCC0PyX3gW7orA.jpeg)

After arriving at Senso-ji Temple, there were still a lot of people. I took some photos and then left.

At this time, it was getting close to evening, so I slowly started moving towards Tokyo Skytree.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*6ExtaiUokR9GBbSVJx5vgw.jpeg)

#### Tokyo Skytree

Since it was still early, I continued walking to enjoy the scenery along the way.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*el3BcNabEMsw-7Tx3GZzgA.jpeg)

The closer I got, the larger it appeared.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*qKg6zvO3sMM-oNDGZyUpfg.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*8TZrxAKhmSKtjk5rD9Voog.jpeg)

After arriving at Tokyo Skytree, I first strolled around the shopping mall inside and ordered a cup of Hokkaido strawberry ice cream to take a break.

We didn't get tickets for the Top Deck at Tokyo Skytree, only for the middle observation deck, entering at 7 PM.

When we first went up, it wasn't dark yet, so I casually took a few photos:

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*pOGzA_5_f_VLjVIEgw2otA.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*HjuVjuSAWRQYUtA3MQ_RMQ.jpeg)

After sunset, you can overlook the entire night view of Tokyo, which is beautiful:

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*bd6JaJLkQCgu1atENjQcnw.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*S2ntCrY9Gu0tA9-atMKN2g.jpeg)

In the upper left corner of the first image is the distant Tokyo Tower; it was very dark inside, and the glass reflected light, making it difficult to take selfies.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*Gx9gcoOw8GbTb_jmnqf7cg.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*lMTqSCFAFZ49y7VFIdECMA.jpeg)

I managed to take a photo XD

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*BZ-mF6Pt2Rylli8stxVgsg.jpeg)

A final glance back before leaving.

On the last night, I had dinner at an izakaya and took some photos of the night scenery on the street:

![Grilled Chicken](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*FXeOJjkMBaRv8_iFjux0FA.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*F8OpQmJanIg3rYMeVYJyZw.jpeg)

The weather in Japan has also turned bad today. I didn't expect to see Tokyo Tower and special installation art every day while passing through Shiodome; I finally stopped to appreciate it on the last day.
#### Late-night Snack on the Last Night

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*FZVgAYYivVJdua14nVnGCA.jpeg)

Instant noodles from Nissin are still delicious, paired with convenience store fried chicken 🤤! A few days ago, I bought melon juice, and today I bought strawberry juice, which is just as good; I don't remember the sake, but these two should be average.
### Day 5: National Diet Building, Imperial Palace, Tokyo Station, Return Trip

After getting up, I went to store my luggage. Just like Day 4, I casually explored Tokyo on my own since my flight was in the evening, leaving me with half a day to wander. The weather was gloomy and rainy.

I remembered seeing a capsule toy machine at Tokyo Skytree yesterday that had a model of the National Diet Building, which I hadn't seen before, so I headed in that direction.
#### National Diet Building


One of the interesting events was encountering an extreme nationalist protest on the street:

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*79-ZKQOjM_56OHgQIS1txA.jpeg)

A promotional vehicle was loudly broadcasting near the Capitol, and after being stopped by the police, they dismantled his broadcasting equipment; later, he sped through a red light to escape, with police everywhere, which was a bit frightening.

Passing by the Capitol, the gates were tightly closed, so I didn't go in (it seems you can enter for a visit through the side door?):

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*DeTHCELCpXflu_j2E4EBwA.jpeg)

I took a distant photo to mark my visit and then headed down towards the Imperial Palace.
#### Imperial Palace

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*2EkLWc88Fg6EL7lDSKLx_Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*ZFKmUCtAfpBFl0B3EEThoA.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*pTkuzirMEvnMMgIVlAMJ3w.jpeg)

The Imperial Palace is really large; just walking from the outer entrance took about 30 minutes.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*3EfxeTDjd200x6tmXudy6w.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*Lj-VBIZQRt7Q7F5OXB8Elw.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*plDrV1fyPuyjg_ugYFkPQA.jpeg)

After reaching the tenshu (main keep), I left, as the Imperial Palace was not open for visits that day.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*akOJoh9TbuF4vRa31vQ3hA.jpeg)

I probably walked for another hour back to Tokyo Station (I could have taken the subway, but it was just one or two stops; I prefer to walk around and enjoy the scenery).
#### Tokyo Station

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*-kWKZRIhw25MLiAmhoyr7w.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*XgvGO0_bl8ZDiyMwO8worw.jpeg)

By this time, it was approaching noon, and I wandered around Tokyo Station; just proving to myself that I wouldn't get lost, but I was too lazy to queue at the famous souvenir shops.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*tF1S7gPcxvrpkU--moDuvQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*3iRGJHBJE2iO7BEnyXWWsw.jpeg)

For my last meal, I had tempura soba.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*fu-7gK8-T7CaWt9PeMhJxg.png)

I casually picked up a large and a small sake from a liquor shop to take back to Taiwan, and the staff were also Taiwanese.
#### Return Trip

Around 4 PM, I returned to the hotel to pick up my luggage and started to slowly make my way to Narita Airport.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*0yeF_2DhmMscbjxL6ap5Vg.jpeg)

A corner of Shimbashi before leaving.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*V2y0RkxHN1lCtsxvo-TEOQ.jpeg)

I went directly from Shimbashi to Narita Airport due to schedule issues and had plenty of time. I took the Toei Asakusa Line Airport Express, which takes about 1 hour and 15 minutes; **but you can't use a card or buy tickets with Suica, so I had to scramble to gather the fare for three people, almost couldn't afford it**.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*7mWMXJCxvX0OS1A9dNYw0g.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*I0B4z9_2o6YvlfrkbhQ0_Q.jpeg)

I arrived at the airport around 5:30, which was still early.

After going through immigration, there was still plenty of time, so I grabbed a quick bite and then did some last-minute shopping at the duty-free store.

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*QBg6PaavQB_APNu3HVS6LQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*rVzt02185oJ8VzrPrEEoUg.jpeg)

I found that if you want to buy Dassai or common souvenirs (Shiroi Koibito, banana cake, etc.), they have everything here, so it's better to buy it here XD

The price of Dassai was about the same as what I found at Tokyo Station.

On the plane, Hey 🇹🇼:

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*0l9gfa7nwm7r4J_TevA3xg.jpeg)

![](/assets/9da2c51fa4f2/1*BoPaciNyNmgw0z3hcRDJBA.jpeg)

The weather in Japan was quite bad, and the plane was shaking all the way (dead fish eyes), more thrilling than the rides at Disney, and we even stopped serving meals for a while; thankfully, we finally arrived safely in Taiwan.

After going through customs and immigration, it was around 00:12, and I took a white taxi back to Taipei, arriving around 01:30; I took a shower and went straight to sleep, ending this journey.
### Postscript
- For insights on Japanese culture, please refer to the previous article "[\[Travelogue\] 2023 Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe & 🇯🇵 First Landing](../76d66c2e34af/)"
- The Japanese time notation is in a 30-hour format, where 25:00 represents 1:00 AM, which is cool.
- It's really necessary to keep at least 10,000 yen on hand to avoid situations where you can't use a card or can't swipe a Visa card.
- Thanks to my travel companions, Sean INFJ/James ISTJ, the planning experts; Sean was in charge of which rides to do first at Disney and which fast passes were worth buying.
