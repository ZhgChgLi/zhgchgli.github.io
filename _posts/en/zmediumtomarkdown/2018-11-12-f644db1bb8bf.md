### iOS ≥ 12 Adds Shortcut to 'APP Notification Settings Page' in User's 'Settings' \(Swift\)

In addition to turning off notifications from the system, users have other options.

#### Following the previous three articles:
- [iOS ≥ 10 Notification Service Extension Application \(Swift\)](../cb6eba52a342/)
- [What? iOS 12 Can Send Push Notifications Without User Authorization \(Swift\)](../ade9e745a4bf/)
- [Handling Push Notification Permission Status from iOS 9 to iOS 12 \(Swift\)](../fd7f92d52baa/)

We continue to improve push notifications, whether through existing technologies or newly opened features, let's give it a try!
### What is this about?

iOS ≥ 12 allows you to add a shortcut to your APP's notification settings page in the user's 'Settings', giving users other options when they want to adjust notifications; they can jump to 'in-app' instead of directly turning it off from the 'system side'. Here’s a picture first:

![‘Settings’ -> ‘APP’ -> ‘Notifications’ -> ‘Set in APP’](/assets/f644db1bb8bf/1*BAdVMElIjgg34meOSdHhOw.gif)

‘Settings’ -> ‘APP’ -> ‘Notifications’ -> ‘Set in APP’

Additionally, when users receive notifications, if they want to use 3D Touch to adjust the settings to 'turn off' notifications, there will be an additional option 'Set in APP' for users to choose.

‘Notifications’ -> ‘3D Touch’ -> ‘…’ -> ‘Turn Off…’ -> ‘Set in APP’
### How to Implement?

The implementation of this part is very simple. The first step is to request an additional **.providesAppNotificationSettings** permission when requesting push notification permissions.
```swift
//appDelegate.swift didFinishLaunchingWithOptions or....
if #available(iOS 12.0, *) {
    let center = UNUserNotificationCenter.current()
    let permissiones:UNAuthorizationOptions = [.badge, .alert, .sound, .provisional,.providesAppNotificationSettings]
    center.requestAuthorization(options: permissiones) { (granted, error) in
        
    }
}
```

After asking the user whether to allow notifications, if notifications are enabled, an option will appear below ( **regardless of whether the user pressed allow or deny earlier** ).
#### Second Step:

The second step, which is also the final step; we need to make **appDelegate** conform to the **UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate** protocol and implement the **userNotificationCenter( _ center: UNUserNotificationCenter, openSettingsFor notification: UNNotification?)** method!
```swift
//appDelegate.swift
import UserNotifications
@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    var window: UIWindow?
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        if #available(iOS 10.0, *) {
            UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self
        }
        
        return true
    }
    //Other parts omitted...
}
extension AppDelegate: UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate {
    @available(iOS 10.0, *)
    func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter, openSettingsFor notification: UNNotification?) {
        //Jump to your settings page location..
        //EX:
        //let VC = SettingViewController();
        //self.window?.rootViewController.present(alertController, animated: true)
    }
}
```
- Implement the delegate in AppDelegate's didFinishLaunchingWithOptions.
- AppDelegate conforms to the delegate and implements the method.

完成！相較於前幾篇文章，這個功能實作相較起來非常簡單 🏆
### Summary

This feature is somewhat similar to the one mentioned in the [previous article](../ade9e745a4bf/) where we send low-intrusiveness silent push notifications to users without requiring user authorization to test the waters!

Both aim to build a new bridge between developers and users. In the past, when an app was too noisy, we would directly go to the settings page and ruthlessly turn off all notifications. However, this approach means that developers can no longer send any notifications—good or bad, useful or not—to users, who may miss important messages or limited-time offers as a result.

This feature allows users the option to adjust notifications within the app when they want to turn them off. Developers can categorize push notifications, enabling users to decide what types of notifications they wish to receive.

For the [Marriage App](https://itunes.apple.com/tw/app/%E7%B5%90%E5%A9%9A%E5%90%A7-%E4%B8%8D%E6%89%BE%E6%9C%80%E8%B2%B4-%E5%8F%AA%E6%89%BE%E6%9C%80%E5%B0%8D/id1356057329?ls=1&mt=8){:target="_blank"}, if users find the column notifications too intrusive, they can turn them off individually; however, they will still receive important system message notifications.

> **p.s. The individual notification off feature is something our app already has, but by integrating the new notification features of iOS ≥12, we can achieve better results and enhance user experience.**
