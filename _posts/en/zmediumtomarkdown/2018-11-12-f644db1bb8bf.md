### iOS ≥ 12 Adds Shortcut to 'App Notification Settings Page' in User's 'Settings' \(Swift\)

In addition to turning off notifications from the system, users have other options.

#### Following the Previous Three Articles:
- [iOS ≥ 10 Notification Service Extension Application \(Swift\)](../cb6eba52a342/)
- [What? iOS 12 Can Send Push Notifications Without User Authorization \(Swift\)](../ade9e745a4bf/)
- [Handling Push Notification Permission Status from iOS 9 to iOS 12 \(Swift\)](../fd7f92d52baa/)

We continue to improve push notifications, whether through existing technologies or newly opened features, let's give it a try!
### What's New This Time?

iOS ≥ 12 allows you to add a shortcut to your app's notification settings page in the user's 'Settings', giving users more options when they want to adjust notifications; they can jump to the 'in-app' settings instead of directly turning them off from the 'system'. Here’s a preview:

![Settings -> App -> Notifications -> Set in App](/assets/f644db1bb8bf/1*BAdVMElIjgg34meOSdHhOw.gif)

Settings -> App -> Notifications -> Set in App

Additionally, when users receive a notification and wish to use 3D Touch to adjust the 'turn off' notification settings, there will be an extra option for 'Set in App' for users to choose.

Notifications -> 3D Touch -> ... -> Turn Off... -> Set in App
### How to Implement?

The implementation is very simple. The first step is to request an additional **\.providesAppNotificationSettings** permission when asking for push notification permissions.
```swift
//appDelegate.swift didFinishLaunchingWithOptions or....
if #available(iOS 12.0, *) {
    let center = UNUserNotificationCenter.current()
    let permissions: UNAuthorizationOptions = [.badge, .alert, .sound, .provisional, .providesAppNotificationSettings]
    center.requestAuthorization(options: permissions) { (granted, error) in
        
    }
}
```

After asking the user whether to allow notifications, if notifications are enabled, the option will appear below ( **regardless of whether the user pressed allow or deny earlier** ).
#### Second Step:

The second and final step is to make the **appDelegate** conform to the **UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate** protocol and implement the **userNotificationCenter\( \_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter, openSettingsFor notification: UNNotification?\)** method!
```swift
//appDelegate.swift
import UserNotifications
@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    var window: UIWindow?
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        if #available(iOS 10.0, *) {
            UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self
        }
        
        return true
    }
    //Other parts omitted...
}
extension AppDelegate: UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate {
    @available(iOS 10.0, *)
    func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter, openSettingsFor notification: UNNotification?) {
        //Redirect to your settings page location..
        //EX:
        //let VC = SettingViewController();
        //self.window?.rootViewController.present(alertController, animated: true)
    }
}
```
- Implement the delegate in the AppDelegate's didFinishLaunchingWithOptions.
- The AppDelegate conforms to the delegate and implements the method.

Done! Compared to the previous articles, this feature implementation is relatively simple 🏆
### Summary

This feature is somewhat similar to what was mentioned in the [previous article](../ade9e745a4bf/) about sending low-intrusiveness silent push notifications to users without requiring authorization to test the waters!

Both are about building a new bridge between developers and users. In the past, if an app was too noisy, we would go directly to the settings page and ruthlessly turn off all notifications. However, this approach means that developers can no longer send any notifications to users, whether good or bad, useful or not... Users might miss important messages or limited-time offers.

This feature allows users to have the option to adjust notifications within the app when they want to turn them off, enabling developers to segment push notification items and let users decide what types of notifications they want to receive.

For example, in the [Marriage App](https://itunes.apple.com/tw/app/%E7%B5%90%E5%A9%9A%E5%90%A7-%E4%B8%8D%E6%89%BE%E6%9C%80%E8%B2%B4-%E5%8F%AA%E6%89%BE%E6%9C%80%E5%B0%8D/id1356057329?ls=1&mt=8){:target="_blank"}, if users find the column notifications too intrusive, they can turn them off individually while still receiving important system message notifications.

> **p\.s The individual notification off feature is something our app already had, but by combining it with the new notification features in iOS ≥12, we can achieve better results and enhance user experience.**
