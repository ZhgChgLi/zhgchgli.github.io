### **A Milestone of 1,000 Followers On Medium**



经营 Medium 七年，终于达成 1,000 追踪者里程碑！

> *English version down below.*



经营 Medium 7 年、累积 112 篇文章、约 13 万字，投入超过 800 小时，终于在 2025 年 4 月 2 日达成了梦想中的目标 — — 1,000 Followers。



说来话长，从 2018 年开始，自己从 Web 转战 App 开发，一切对我来说都充满新鲜感，总是抱著求知若渴的心态，不断自行查阅资料，边学边做，最终完成并上架了自己的第一个 App 作品。



由于完全自学，当时从许多前辈们留下的网路文章中获益良多，也因此萌生了撰写文章「教学相长」的念头，希望自己也能创造出一个良善的循环。



一开始，也曾陷入「分享迷思」，总担心内容不够完整、担心被人挑惕，更怕对读者毫无帮助。
但后来转念一想，写文章就像是在种下一颗种子，总有一天，一位遇到类似问题的开发者能从我的文章中得到帮助，或者借此进一步深入探索。
即使写的内容不一定会被看见，但若不开始，这些美好的可能性就无法发生，也因为这样不断地坚持写作，才逐渐提升了自己的能力，让文章内容更加丰富，更有机会帮助到他人。



那段期间正好搭上时代的顺风车，App 与软体工程蓬勃发展。日常持续学习、开发新功能，并且将自己的经验转化为文章不断分享出去；同时，也有源源不绝的新鲜人加入开发行列，因此每次发文总能获得新的追踪者。



近几年，随著产业降温、AI 对数位内容创作领域的冲击，以及 Medium SEO 政策的变化，新追踪人数的增长明显放缓；对于达成「1K 目标」开始抱持佛系心态，但内心依旧保有最初的分享精神，继续坚持记录并协助遇到相似问题的朋友。
此外也开始分享一些日常生活、旅行游记、开箱文，以及个人兴趣的自动化（RPA）相关内容。



1K 只是个里程碑，未来还请大家多多指教。
不论之后是否继续撰写 iOS 开发内容，都会持续分享自己所经历的问题和所学到的经验。



由衷感谢大家这 7 年来的支持与陪伴！

#### English



After seven years on Medium, publishing 112 articles, approximately 130,000 words, and investing over 800 hours, I finally reached my long-awaited milestone of 1,000 followers on April 2, 2025.



It’s been quite a journey. Back in 2018, when I switched my focus from web development to app development, everything felt new and exciting. With an insatiable curiosity, I constantly searched for resources, learned by doing, and eventually completed and published my first app.



As someone entirely self-taught, I gained a tremendous amount from online articles shared by many seasoned developers. This inspired me to begin writing myself, driven by the idea of “learning by teaching,” hoping to foster a positive cycle of knowledge-sharing.



Initially, I was caught up in doubts about sharing — always concerned whether my content was thorough enough, whether I’d be criticized, or even worse, whether it provided no real value to readers.



Eventually, I shifted my mindset. Writing is like planting a seed — someday, a developer encountering a similar problem might find help or inspiration through my posts. Even if my articles weren’t immediately seen, if I never started writing, those possibilities would never materialize. With continuous writing and persistence, I gradually improved my skills, enriching my content and increasing its potential to benefit others.



Fortunately, I rode the wave of rapid growth in apps and software engineering. Day after day, I learned, built new features, and shared my experiences through writing. There was also a steady influx of new developers entering the field, and each article brought new followers.



In recent years, growth has notably slowed, impacted by industry cooling, AI-driven changes to digital content creation, and shifts in Medium’s SEO policies. Gradually, I adopted a more relaxed approach towards reaching the 1,000-follower mark. Yet, I never lost the initial passion for sharing and continued documenting my experiences to help those encountering similar issues. Additionally, I started sharing daily life stories, travel experiences, product reviews, and content about my personal interest in automation (RPA) .



Reaching 1,000 followers is just a milestone, and I look forward to your continued support in the future. Regardless of whether I continue writing about iOS development, I’ll keep sharing the problems I encounter and the knowledge I gain.



I sincerely thank everyone for your support and companionship over these past seven years!
